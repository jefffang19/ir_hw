0,Hereditary Colorectal Cancer in China,"According to the IACR (International Association of Cancer Registries) [1], in the year 2002, 150,956 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) were expected to occur in China, while the age-standardised incidence of colorectal cancer would be 13.6/100,000 in men and 9.3/100,000 in women. These predictions were derived from cancer statistics of six separate areas in China from 1993 to 1997. However, in 1999 colorectal cancer incidence in Shanghai, the biggest city in China included in the IARC's estimates, had already reached 16.2/100,000 in men and 14.5/100,000 in women [2], more than a one-fold increase compared with the 1972-1974 period [3]. Shanghai has witnessed the highest and fastest growing colorectal cancer incidence in China. It is a fact that the incidence of colorectal cancer in China is increasing rapidly.Genetic alterations as well as environmental influences are thought to underlie the development of all colorectal malignancies. In general, environmental changes play a critical role in the rapid growth of colorectal cancer incidence, while the contribution of genetic alterations that cause hereditary colorectal cancer is probably relatively stable. Although there are no statistics available on the incidence of hereditary colorectal cancer in China as a whole, we expect that the incidence of hereditary colorectal cancer in China is growing due to the changing environment as well as to more diagnosed cases because of more clearly specified diagnostic criteria. According to Lynch et al. [4], approximately 20% of all patients with colorectal cancer carry a familial risk, with 5-10% inherited as a Mendelian trait. Hereditary colorectal cancer can be broadly classified into two categories based on the presence or absence of multiple colorectal polyps: polyposis syndromes and nonpolyposis syndromes. The former can be further divided on the basis of histologic criteria into adenomatous-like FAP and hamartomatous syndromes like juvenile polyposis and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This article will review clinical and basic research on both types of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes in China, focusing on the differences with Western countries and particular characteristics of Chinese hereditary colorectal cancer. Relevant new issues on hereditary colorectal cancer outside China will also be discussed.","HNPCC, which some prefer to refer to as Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations of mismatch repair (MMR) genes. This disorder is characterised by early onset of colorectal cancer and other malignancies including gastric, endometrial, ovarian, ureter, renal pelvis, hepatobiliary tract and small bowel cancer. When the name Lynch syndrome was first coined by Borland in 1984 [5], a Lynch family with five cases was reported in the same year in a Chinese medical journal [6], but it was not until 1998 that a series of Chinese HNPCC families began to be studied [7]. Several research groups in China have been devoted to collecting and studying Chinese Lynch families. With their effort, clinical and molecular research on HNPCCs in China has been greatly accelerated.","The diagnostic criteria for HNPCC continue to evolve as the understanding and characteristics of this heterogeneous disorder improve. The Amsterdam criteria, which were established in 1990 and revised in 1999, have been the classical diagnostic criteria of HNPCC. Based on the Amsterdam criteria, HNPCC in China accounts for 2.2% of all colorectal cancer [8]. However, the Amsterdam criteria are too strict for diagnostic purposes or for exclusion of patients from further work-up. More importantly, they do not account for patients from small families, which is a common phenomenon in China. With these deficiencies in mind, several sets of modified clinical criteria such as the Bethesda criteria [9], revised Bethesda criteria [10], Japanese criteria [11] and Korean suspected criteria [12] have been proposed. The National Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Network of China proposed Chinese HNPCC criteria in 2003 [13]. Based on the Korean suspected criteria, Chinese HNPCC criteria have been modified as follows: at least two pathologically verified colorectal cancers in a family; at least two of them are first-degree relatives including parents or siblings; in addition, at least one of these conditions has to be satisfied: (1) at least one case develops multiple colorectal cancer, including adenomas, (2) at least one colorectal cancer is diagnosed before age 50, (3) at least one case with extracolonic malignancies including gastric, endometrial, small bowel, ureter and renal pelvis, ovarian, and hepatobiliary malignancies. The differences between Chinese criteria and other criteria are listed in Table 1.Table 1 Comparison of clinical diagnostic criteria for HNPCCFull size table","Since the discovery of the major human gene with DNA misrepair function in 1993-1995, mutations in MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 have been convincingly associated with HNPCC. According to the database maintained by the international collaborative group on HNPCC (International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumor, InSiGHT), approximately 450 different HNPCC-associated mismatch repair gene mutations are known that primarily involve MLH1 (~50%), MSH2 (~39%), and MSH6 (~7%) [14]. Most of these mutations are frameshift and nonsense mutations which are obviously pathogenic, but the roles missense mutations play are diversified. Some may be harmless single nucleotide polymorphisms, whereas others may contribute to cancer risks. Studying segregation of these mutations in affected and unaffected relatives, and functional assays, are among the methods to investigate the functional nature of these missense mutations. In addition to these point mutations, large genomic rearrangements of MMR genes have recently been reported to play an important role in the development of HNPCC. A systematic search of 439 HNPCC families for genomic rearrangements in MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 has identified 48 genomic rearrangements in 68 unrelated kindreds. Twenty-nine out of 48 were found in MSH2, 13 in MLH1, 2 in MSH6, and 4 in PMS2 [15].For the purpose of presenting the genetic alterations in Chinese HNPCC families, eight doctorate studies [16–23] which aimed at germline mutation detection in Chinese HNPCC have been summarised. A total of 35 clinically diagnosed unrelated HNPCC families, most of them meeting Amsterdam criteria, have been found to carry 43 germline mutations (60% MLH1 mutations and 40% MSH2 mutations (Table 2). All of the genomic sites of mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Among these mutations, 10/43 (23%) result in a shift of transcribe reading frame. Eight out of forty-three (19%) are nonsense mutations which lead to truncating proteins. These are obviously pathological mutations. However, missense and splice site mutations, which account for 14/43 (33%) and 7/43 (16%), respectively, are putative mutations needing further pathological verifications. Four of the observed mutations were small nucleotide deletions, which may help in discovering the critical amino acid related functions of MMR proteins. In addition to small mutations, large genomic rearrangements of Chinese HNPCC are also investigated. Huang et al. first reported a genomic deletion ranging from exon 1 to exon 7 of MSH2 gene in a Chinese HNPCC family meeting Amsterdam criteria [24]. A recent study [25] shows that large genomic rearrangements, mostly deletions rather than duplications, were responsible for 7 out of 45 hereditary colorectal patients. These large fragment aberrations, uncovered in both MSH2 and MLH1, indicate that large genomic rearrangements play a role in the pathogenesis of Chinese hereditary CRC patients. So far, the genetic alterations in Chinese HNPCC appear similar to those in Western countries; however, there are no data yet on the prevalence of Chinese MSH6 and PMS2 gene mutations.Table 2 Germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations observed in Chinese HNPCC familiesFull size tableIn the Chinese studies, colorectal cancer patients were selected for germline mutation detection, more frequently using criteria for suspected HNPCC rather than the Bethesda criteria. Table 3 shows different detection rates of germline mutations in typical and suspected HNPCC families. The highest rate was observed in kindreds meeting the Amsterdam criteria, which is about 44%, similar to that in reports from Western countries, which often quote a rate between 40% and 60%. Compared with the Bethesda criteria, we prefer to use the suspected HNPCC criteria in the clinical setting of screening for HNPCC. Especially in small Chinese families we would suggest using the suspected HNPCC criteria rather than the Amsterdam criteria.Table 3 Rates of detected germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations in Chinese typical and suspected HNPCC patientsFull size table"
1,Do precursor polyp burdens help distinguish Lynch versus non-Lynch microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers?,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) within colorectal cancers (CRC) may develop through inherited germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch Syndrome) or sporadic epigenetic methylation of tumor suppressor or repair genes (methylator pathway). Although the molecular mechanisms in each pathway have been described, their associated precursor polyp burdens are not well-defined. This study analyzes precursor polyp burdens occurring within patients with MSI-H colorectal cancers associated with Lynch Syndrome (LS) or those with a methylator pathway cancer phenotype.","MSI-H CRCs were identified either from an inherited CRC registry or clinic-based frozen tissue bank. Patients with confirmed MMR germline defects were defined as LS. MSI-H tumors considered to be methylators were defined by previously determined CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). These two groups were also compared to MSS/CIMP-negative tumor controls. Corresponding patient demographics, all prior preoperative colonoscopy, operative, and pathology reports for polyp characteristics were reviewed.","114 patients were included: 29 LS, 22 Methylator, and 63 MSS/CIMP-negative. No differences were observed between groups in terms of gender, total number or percentage of patients with polyps, and polyp location. The LS group was younger, had larger polyps size (1.0 em vs. methylators, 0.4 cm, p=0.02), and more malignant polyps (4/30) vs. methylators (0/26) and MSS/CIMP-N (1/1 00), p=0.01. Although adenomas were the most prevalent polyp type in all groups, serrated polyps were located more frequently in the right colon in methylators (9 of 12) compared to LS patients (1 of 5), p=0.01. Importantly, the percentage of serrated polyps varied by group with 46% (12/26) incidence in methylators compared to 17% (5/30) in LS (p=0.02) and 24% (24/100) in MSS/CIMP-negative patients (p=0.03).","Polyp burdens associated with MSI-H CRC vary depending on the etiology of microsatellite instability. While LS patients tend to develop adenomas similar to the general population, an increased relative burden of serrated polyps is associated with the methylator phenotype. These findings may help guide investigation into suspected Lynch syndrome."
2,Plasma prolactin in patients with colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer is the third highest cause of cancer mortality [1]. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, it is the second common cancer for women after breast cancer (age-standardised incidence 22–33 per 100,000), and men after prostate or lung cancer (age-standardised incidence 31–47 per 100,000). About 148,300 new cases are reported each year in the USA and 56,600 Americans die annually from this cause [2]. Prognostic factors are very important for the evaluation, judgment and optimal treatment of patients with cancer.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been recognized as a serum marker for colorectal cancer in the past three decades [3] and has an important role in the management of colorectal cancer [4].Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone with multiple biological actions, synthesized by the anterior pituitary gland [5] and is best known for its roles in the mammary gland. However, it is now revealed that PRL is able to exert its effects on additional cells and tissues (decidual cells of the placenta, bone, brain, lymphocytes and breast epithelial cells) [6, 7]. PRL is secreted not only by lactotrophic cells of the pituitary gland but also by a variety of other normal tissues and human tumours [8] including malignant tumours of the lung[9], kidney[10], uterine[11], ovary [12], and breast[13]. Increase of PRL in colorectal cancer is unclear. Bhatavdekar, et al reported a significantly higher preoperative prolactin levels in patients with colorectal carcinoma [14], While, Indinnimeo et al and Carlson et al could not confirm hyperprolactinemia in patients with colorectal cancer. [15, 16] These conflicting results do not support the hypothesis of increasing level of PRL in colorectal carcinoma.The aim of this study was to see whether PRL levels are increased in colorectal cancer and to compare the preoperative serum levels of PRL and CEA concentrations in colorectal cancer patients; also we intended to find the possible correlation between hyperprolactinemia and the stage of colorectal cancer.","This cross-sectional study included 47 patients with colorectal cancer (18 women, 29 men; mean age 55.4 years, range 32–81) and 51 non-cancer patients (21 women, 30 men; mean age 58.5 years, range 20–81), who were candidates of colectomy. All patients were admitted in Shariati general hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) from April 2001 to January 2003. All women in the study were postmenopausal. None of the patients were on any drugs known to increase plasma prolactin levels in the last 6 months prior to the study and were not affected by endocrine, renal, and psychiatric disorders. There was no history of rectal bleeding and family history of colorectal cancer. Peripheral venous blood samples were daily collected from seven days before the operation to measure serum PRL and CEA levels. Blood samples were collected between 07:30 a.m. and 09:30 a.m. to avoid diurnal variation of PRL. Serum prolactin levels were measured with immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) kits produced by Kavoshian co (Tehran-Iran). Serum CEA levels were assayed by IRMA, who used kits from IMMUNOTECH co (Marseille-France). The PRL and CEA assays were carried out within 10 days of sampling. The cut off levels for PRL and CEA were 20 ng/ml and 5 ng/ml serum respectively [17, 18]. Stages of cancer were determined by pathology assessment of neoplastic specimens.The study was approved by the Vice-Chancellor of ResearchEthic Committee of TUMS.The data evaluated by Chi-square test and T test using the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for Windows version 11.5. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.","The number of male and female participants was 29 and 18 in case and 30 and 21 in control group.We compared serum PRL and CEA level of 47 patients with 51 healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the age and the sex distribution of the patients and control groups.Mean PRL serum level in colorectal cancer group was 21.6 ± 8.1versus 10.5 ± 4.6 in control group, which was significantly different (p < 0.0001). In other words 36 patients showed hyperprolctinemia (76.7%) while there was only one such patient in the control group (1.9%).CEA level in 59.6% of the cancer group was above the normal compared with 1.9% of controls (P < 0.0001).Out of 47 patients in the cancer group 9 were in stage I (19.1%), 19 in stage II (40.4%), 10 in stage III (21.3 %) and 9 in stage IV (19.1%). Hyperprolactinemia and high CEA concentrations were found in all stages (figure 1).Figure 1Hyperprolactinemia and high CEA levels in stages of colorectal cancer.Full size image
","Prognostic factors are crucial for the evaluation and optimal treatment of patients with cancer [17]. Therefore tumour markers have a greater role in the assessment of therapeutic response. Measurements of serum tumour markers may be helpful in detecting the metastatic process while still in the sub clinical phase [15]. The ectopic secretion of hormones like PRL by non-endocrine neoplasms is well recognized and used as therapeutic monitoring [15].The main source of PRL is the pituitary gland, but in recent years, some studies have reported hyperprolactinemia in patients with breast [13], lung [9], prostate and ovary tumours [12].Elevated circulatory levels of this hormone have also been detected in colorectal cancer. Bhatavdekar et al reported a high preoperative serum concentration of PRL in patients with colorectal cancer [14]. Ilan et al. reported elevated levels of PRL in 53% of the patients with colorectal malignancy [19]. Baert et al, in contrast didn't determine preoperative hyperprolactinemia in a series of 32 patients and their study didn't support the hypothesis of ectopic prolactin production by colorectal cancer [20]. Indinnimeo, et al found no hyperprolactinemia and prolactin positive immunostaining in colorectal cancer [15]. Previous studies, that reported normal levels of PRL [20, 15], have suggested such factors as renal, endocrine and psychiatric disorders, medications and premenopausal situation may be the cause of hyperprolactinemia in patients with colorectal neoplasms. In the present study, patients with above factors were excluded and our results confirmed preoperative hyperprolactinemia in colorectal cancer. We found no correlation between the plasma PRL concentration and the stage of the tumour.CEA present in blood during fetal life, falls to very low levels in most adults, and circulates in high concentrations in patients with some cancers [21]. CEA is over expressed in most colorectal cancers and is an important tumour marker in the management of colorectal cancer. A preoperative high CEA value suggests advanced disease either locally or with a distant metastasis. The preoperative serum CEA level can be a useful predicting factor regarding the outcome of the surgical operation [4]. In the present study we found that serum PRL and CEA levels are increased in patients with colorectal cancer but the greater portion of the patients had an increased level of PRL compared with elevated level of CEA. Considering the fact that laboratory cost for detecting CEA is higher than PRL, We suggest PRL as a valuable tumour marker in colorectal cancer. There are studies that support the tumour marker value of PRL [18, 22] and studies that do not [16, 20]."
3,High CEA levels in a case of resected colorectal cancer: delayed diagnosis of metachronous medullary thyroid cancer,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most widely used tumor markers, and its value in the surveillance of post-operative colorectal cancer is well established [1, 2]. However, it is also overexpressed in many different tumors, such as lung cancer and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has several well-recognized applications in colorectal cancer imaging including preoperative staging, evaluation of therapeutic response, detection of disease recurrence, and investigation of unexplained rising tumor markers [3, 4]. In addition, the whole body scan of FDG-PET may detect occult metachronous tumors.","A 56-year-old man with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC) status post curative resection presented with high serum CEA level up to 68 μg/L (normal limit < 5 μg/L, measured by radioimmunoassay) 5 years after surgery. To investigate for possibility of cancer recurrence, distant metastasis, or other tumors, we performed FDG-PET (Siemens Ecat Exact HR+ scanner). It demonstrated mildly focal increased FDG uptake in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, and maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV) was 2.5 (Fig. 1). We did not observe other pathologic FDG uptake in the PET images. Therefore, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the hypermetabolic thyroid nodule, and the cytology revealed negative for malignancy.Fig. 1The first time FDG-PET scan of the patient of resected colorectal cancer with elevated CEA level (68 µg/L) showed focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe (arrow)Full size image
Progressively rising CEA levels up to 184 μg/L were noted over the following 5 years. However, serial follow-up abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and colonoscopy did not find evidence of recurrent disease of CRC. Subsequently, we performed FDG-PET/CT (GE Discovery LS PET/CT hybrid scanner) again and observed a hypermetabolic focus in the right thyroid lobe (maxSUV 3.5), which corresponded to the hypodense nodule and calcification shown on CT images (Fig. 2). This time, repeat FNA of the thyroid was done and revealed positive for malignancy, in favor of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The patient underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy and modified radical neck dissection. The histopathology revealed right thyroid medullary carcinoma with a tiny microscopic focus suggesting papillary carcinoma (pT3). Two right neck lymph nodes are metastasized by medullary carcinoma (pN1). The CEA level dropped to 30 μg/L two and a half months after surgery.Fig. 2The second time FDG-PET/CT scan of the same patient with progressively elevated CEA levels up to 184 µg/L showed persistent focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe (arrow), corresponding to the hypodense nodule and calcification shown on CTFull size image
The subsequent follow-up showed fluctuating CEA levels (3.7 ~ 15.5 μg/L) and progressively rising calcitonin levels (up to 843 ng/L) in the first year to the second year after surgery. Ultrasound and FNAC revealed recurrent cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient received lymph nodes dissection and recurrent nodal metastasis from MTC which was proven. At this point, the patient continued regular follow-up in our hospital and the CEA and calcitonin levels remained within normal limits.","CEA is a glycoprotein present in normal mucosal cells, and its increased serum level is associated with adenocarcinoma, especially CRC. CEA level is useful in assessing prognosis, detecting recurrence, and monitoring treatment in patients with CRC [1, 2]. However, it may be elevated in a wide variety of other tumors and benign conditions, such as MTC, lung cancer, neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor, smoking, and infections. A recent systematic review has raised some doubts about the clinical usefulness of CEA in detecting recurrence after intended curative surgery for CRC, which included a total of 42 studies and 9834 CEA testing outcomes during follow-up [5]. Results point toward that CEA did not effectively detect treatable recurrences at an early stage. Besides, the low reliability of positive predictive value may lead to the high false positive rate. Therefore, considerations of factors and diseases known to influence CEA results and identification whether the increase in CEA is part of a fluctuating pattern or if it rises progressively are necessary.FDG-PET and FDG-PET/CT are widely used for diagnosis, staging, evaluating therapeutic response, and detecting recurrence of a wide variety of cancers, including CRC. Many studies have demonstrated the value of PET in the detection of CRC recurrence in the post-operative patients with rising CEA [6,7,8]. Sometimes, the full-body scan of FDG-PET may detect occult synchronous or metachronous tumors. Focal FDG uptake within the thyroid gland can be associated with malignancy, most commonly papillary thyroid carcinoma [9]. Chen et al. had described thyroid incidentaloma identified by FDG-PET occurred with a frequency of 1.2% in 4803 physical check-up examinees, and 14% were proven to be malignant (all papillary carcinomas) [10]. Therefore, a hypermetabolic nodule in the thyroid gland could be either benign or malignant etiology, and further work-up with an ultrasound, FNA, or excisional biopsy is necessary.The ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid is a safe, inexpensive, minimally invasive procedure for determining thyroid malignancy and is an integral part of thyroid nodule evaluation. Limitations of FNA are related to the skill of the operator and the expertise of the cytopathologist. In a review of seven large series totaling 18,183 thyroid FNAs, Gharib et al. found the sensitivity of FNA for diagnosis of thyroid cancer ranges from 65 to 98% (mean, 83%), specificity ranges from 72 to 100% (mean, 92%), false negative rate ranges from 1 to 11% (mean 5%), and false positive rate ranges from 1 to 8% (mean 2.9%) [11]. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association’s guidelines [12], repeat FNAC should be undertaken for the initial non-diagnostic cytology result of thyroid nodule in order to reduce the risk of false negative results.MTC is a rare neuroendocrine malignancy arising from calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C cells in the thyroid gland. It accounts for approximately 3 to 10% of all thyroid neoplasms [13]. Reported sensitivity of FNA for diagnosis of MTC ranges from 53 to 89%, which is less than that of all thyroid cancer. On the other hand, serum calcitonin has an excellent sensitivity in diagnosing MTC from 98 to 99% [14, 15]. Serum CEA is another useful biomarker for MTC, especially in patients with poorly differentiated or metastatic MTC who may not have elevated serum calcitonin level [14]. Nevertheless, CEA level does not have the specificity of calcitonin for MTC. Calcitonin is a hormone produced and secreted by thyroid C cells specifically. Therefore, serum calcitonin levels can be determined as a highly specific biomarker for the early diagnosis of MTC [16]. Overall, FDG-PET/CT is less sensitive in MTC patients with de-differentiated tumors, whereas it is more sensitive in patients with high serum calcitonin (> 1000 ng/L) and short calcitonin doubling times (< 24 months) [17].The patient’s history of resected CRC with high-serum CEA levels made us focus on searching recurrence or metastasis of CRC and overlook other disease causing elevated CEA level. If we checked his serum calcitonin while FDG-PET revealing hypermetabolic thyroid nodule or performed repeat FNAC in the next 3 months after initial negative cytology result, the delay in MTC diagnosis and treatment would have been avoided, and the disease might not spread to the cervical lymph nodes.","FDG-PET/CT has emerged as a powerful imaging tool for the detection of the recurrence of colorectal cancers with rising serum CEA levels. The full-body scan of PET/CT may detect occult tumors that result in CEA elevation, such as MTC. This case reminds us that focal FDG uptake in the thyroid gland with elevated CEA level can be associated with MTC. Moreover, FNA has a higher false negative rate in detecting MTC than other forms of thyroid cancer. In this case, repeat FNA and measure of serum calcitonin could be most helpful in early detection of MTC."
