0,FDG-PET scan in patients with clinically and/or radiologically suspicious colorectal cancer recurrence but normal CEA,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer in both men and in women in the United States. The five-year overall survival rates is 64% [1]. Local recurrence rate is relatively high despite radical curative surgery and up to 50% of patients with local recurrence may benefit from surgery.Early detection and treatment of tumor recurrence is the only hope for long-term survival. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently used tumor marker, it has low sensitivity in the early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC). Conventional imaging methods such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have limited value in differentiating post-surgical changes from local tumor recurrence. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and, particularly, Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) are widely accepted imaging methods in the management of a wide variety of cancers, including CRC. Many studies have demonstrated the value of PET in the detection of CRC recurrence in patients with rising CEA in the post-operative period [2–5]. Studies have also demonstrated the superiority of PET over CT in the detection of local CRC recurrence as well as metastatic disease [6–11]. The role of PET in patients with normal CEA levels, however, is not clear.In this study, we aimed to analyze the value of FDG-PET scans in patients with normal CEA levels but clinical or radiological findings suspicious for tumor recurrence.","A retrospective review of our electronic database of 308 patients with CRC imaged by PET or PET/CT between January 2003 and December 2005 was performed to select and analyze PET scan findings of patients who had normal CEA but clinically and/or radiologically suspicious findings for tumor recurrence. Only patients with correlative histopathological data were included. The institutional review board allowed an exempt retrospective review of the cancer PET database, and informed consent was waived. The normal range for CEA in our clinical laboratory was 0–5.0 ng/mL (chemiluminescent immunoassay). Although the CEA levels were available and normal on all patients at the time of their evaluation for suspicion of recurrent CRC, initial baseline CEA levels taken at a time before their initial treatment for their originally diagnosed CRC were available in only 10 patients (with initial baseline CEA level within normal range in seven patients and elevated in three patients).PET studies were performed on Siemens Biograph 16 PET/CT and HR plus Siemens CTI PET camera (CTI, Inc, Knoxville, TN). The patients fasted approximately 6 hours prior to intravenous injection of 370–555 MBq (10–15 mCi) of Fluorine 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F FDG). Blood glucose levels were checked prior to the injection of 18F FDG. Studies were performed only when blood glucose levels did not exceed 150 mg/dL. The imaging started approximately 60 minutes following intravenous injection of 18F FDG. For the PET/CT camera, first a scout view was obtained with 30 mAs and 130 kVp followed by a spiral CT scan with 130 mAs, 130 kVp, 5-mm scan width, and 12-mm feed per rotation without any specific breath-holding instructions. No IV or oral contrast was given to the patients for acquisition of the CT images. Imaging area was from skull base to proximal femora. PET scanning was performed immediately after acquisition of the CT images without changing the patient position with 2–4 minutes per bed acquisition time. PET images were corrected for attenuation on the basis of the CT data, and iterative reconstruction algorithms were used for reconstruction. For the PET only camera, image acquisition time of 10 minutes per bed by using 40% transmission and 60% emission protocol was used. PET images were corrected for attenuation on the basis of the transmission image data, and iterative reconstruction algorithms were used for reconstruction. PET images were evaluated by two board-certified nuclear medicine physicians (IS and NCH). PET scan was considered positive or suspicious when abnormal non-physiologic metabolic activity was identified. Focal hypermetabolic activity within the liver greater than adjacent normal liver was considered abnormal. Isometabolic liver lesions (metabolic activity equal to liver) were only identified with the help of CT in patients with PET/CT scan. Diffuse mild activity in the bowel was considered normal physiologic uptake. Quantification of the tumor metabolic activity was obtained using the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) normalized to body weight. Mean ± SD of maximum-pixel SUV (SUVmax) of the lesions were calculated. The significance of SUVmax between false positive and true positive lesions were compared by t-test. A P-value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","A total of 369 PET studies (PET: 183, from January 2003 to March 2005 and combined PET/CT: 186, from April 2005 to December 2006) in 308 patients with CRC were reviewed. Only patients with clinical and/or radiological suspicion of tumor recurrence but normal CEA who have histopathological evaluation following PET scan were selected for further analysis. Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. The PET studies were performed by PET scan alone in 27 patients and by combined PET/CT scan in 12 patients. PET was ordered in these patients because of suspicious or equivocal lesions on CT in 17, on barium study in two, or on history and physical exam in 20. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. At the time of suspected recurrent CRC, the mean age was 55 with a near-equal gender distribution. The majority of patients had undergone surgical resection alone with the remainder having chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy prior to or following resection. In two patients receiving chemoradiation, resection of the primary was not undertaken. Surgical exploration was undertaken within one month of PET scan in 37 patients and within two months of PET scan in the other two.Table 1 Patient CharacteristicsFull size tablePET scan was considered normal in 13 (33%) and positive in 26 (67%). At exploration, 27 (69%) patients were found to have histopathologic evidence of tumor recurrence. Of 26 positive PET scans, 22 were true positive and four were false positive. Eight patients were found to have true negative PET scans while five were false negative (Figure 1). In three patients with a false negative PET scan, tumor was mucinous adenocarcinoma and in the other two it was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The overall accuracy of PET was 76.9% with a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 66.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.6%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 61.5%.Figure 1PET scan and final pathology results of the patients who have clinically and/or radiologically suspicious tumor recurrence but normal CEA.Full size imageIn the 26 patients with positive PET scans, PET detected a total of 36 lesions, 32 of which were resected. Histopathological findings in these patients are shown in Table 2. PPV value of PET was highest for liver metastases (88.8%) compared to 73.3% for luminal (i.e. anastomotic) recurrences. All recurrences and metastases were consistent with adenocarcinomas with one demonstrating mucinous features. The exact lesion size was discernable in six patients and ranged from 10 to 30 mm. In two patients with pathology proven adenoma with dysplasia in rectum, PET was accepted as true positive for these lesions due to their pre-malignant nature. Pathology for one patient (patient number 24 in Table 2) with a false positive PET scan in the liver (SUVmax of 3.1) showed focal foreign body reaction with necrosis, organizing inflammation, and fibrosis related to previous surgery (Figure 2). The remaining false positive cases were mainly in the bowel and were secondary to acute/chronic inflammation and granulation tissue. In patients with a false positive PET scan, the time interval between last treatment and PET was 42 months (range:11–96 months). In two cases with a positive PET scan (patient number 8 and 15 in Table 2), CEA became elevated two months after PET scan and subsequent pathology demonstrated tumor recurrence. In one of these two patients, PET showed increased activity in the liver with central photopenia (Figure 3) following treatment with Yttrium-90 microspheres. In one patient (patient number 26 in Table 2) with a false positive PET scan in the rectum, PET scan also demonstrated a bone lesion. Follow-up evaluation demonstrated progression in the bone lesion consistent with metastasis. In two patients with pathology-proven intra-abdominal tumor recurrence, PET also demonstrated mediastinal uptake (patient number 9 and 19 in Table 2). These lesions remained stable on follow-up PET and CT images.Table 2 PET and histopathological findings in 26 patients with positive PET scanFull size tableFigure 2Transaxial, sagittal, and coronal PET/CT fusion images in a patient with prior left lobectomy.

CEA became positive two months after PET and subsequent pathology demonstrated tumor recurrence as well as nodal metastasis.Full size imageIn all patients with negative PET and negative pathology results, follow-up CEA values were available. In six of these patients, follow-up CEA values were normal (mean follow-up time 18.8 months, range: 4–41 months). In two patients, follow-up CEA level increased (mean follow-up time 3 months, range: 2–6 months).PET and PET/CT results were evaluated separately. PET was true positive in 16 patients, false negative in three patients, and true negative in eight patients. PET/CT was true positive in six patients, false positive in four patients, and false negative in two patients. There was no false positive result with PET and no true negative result with PET/CT. The accuracy of PET and PET/CT was 88.8% and 50%, respectively.Mean ± SD of SUVmax of true positive and false positive lesions are shown in Table 3. The mean SUVmax in all true positive lesions tended to be lower than in all false positive lesions, though this did not reach statistical significance (5.51 ± 2.73 vs. 6.75 ± 5.1, p = 0.58). False positive PET findings associated with bowel showed a trend towards higher SUVmax compared to true positive lesions, but this was not statistically significant (8.5 ± 5.5 vs. 6.06 ± 3.5, p = 0.45).Table 3 Mean SUVmax ± standard deviation (SD) in true positive and false positive PET lesions based upon location of PET positive lesions.Full size table","Approximately 70% of patients with newly diagnosed CRC are suitable for a curative resection, but up to 50% of patients recurrence develops usually within two years of surgery [12–14]. Ten to 50% of local recurrences may be suitable for surgical resection [12–20]. In patients with liver metastasis hepatic resection in properly selected patients offers up to a 30% chance of cure [21]. Early detection and prompt treatment of recurrence improves survival. Although CEA is used frequently in the post-operative follow-up period, its sensitivity for early detection of CRC recurrence is less than desirable [22]. Moertel et al. reported that CEA has a sensitivity of 59% in the detection of CRC recurrence [23]. CEA is also not specific for colorectal cancer. A wide variety of non-neoplastic conditions, such as smoking and liver and gastrointestinal diseases, may cause elevation in CEA. The use of PET as part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with rising CEA is well defined. However, there is a paucity of data concerning its role in patients with suspected CRC recurrence and normal CEA. We have shown that PET can be reliably applied in such patients to allow for earlier detection and management of recurrent CRC.PET is a functional/metabolic imaging technique which has been widely used in the diagnosis, staging, and management of a wide variety of tumors. The most commonly used PET agent in oncology is 18F FDG, a positron-labeled non-physiologic analog of glucose. Malignant tumors avidly accumulate FDG because of accelerated glucose metabolism and increased rate of glucose transport and utilization in malignant cells. FDG in the blood is transported into the cells via glucose transporters and phosphorylated to FDG-6-phosphate by hexokinase. This is thought to occur more readily in tumors due to overexpression of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 and higher levels of hexokinase in malignant cells [24]. Because Glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme is low in most of the tissues and tumors, FDG-6-phosphate cannot be dephosphorylated to FDG. Therefore, FDG-6-phosphate cannot cross the cell membrane and is trapped in the cell. As well, FDG-6-phosphate cannot be utilized in the metabolic steps of glycolysis resulting in accumulation of the radioactive tracer.Many studies have demonstrated that FDG-PET has high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of tumor recurrence in patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source by anatomical imaging methods [2–5]. A meta-analysis determined the overall sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 76% for FDG PET for detecting recurrent CRC [25]. Studies have also demonstrated that FDG PET is more sensitive than CT for the detection of recurrent CRC [6–11]. PET was found to be superior to CT in the differentiation of fibrotic scar tissues from locally recurrent tumor [26]. The accuracy of PET for locally recurrent disease was reported as 95% which was superior to pelvic-CT (65%) [27]. PET is more sensitive than CT in detecting liver metastases and defining the number of the lobes involved. Arulapalam et al. reported the sensitivity of PET and CT as 100% and 45%, respectively, in the detection of liver metastasis [6]. Similar to CT, MRI also has limitations in the differentiation of fibrotic scar from local recurrence. Although there is increasing use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR, it is not clear yet whether it is superior to PET in the detection of recurrence. Contrast-enhanced liver MRI and whole-body FDG-PET were comparable in the detection of patients with liver metastases [28]. PET provided additional information about extrahepatic disease. PET is a valuable imaging method to differentiate isolated resectable recurrence from disseminated metastatic disease to select patients who would benefit from surgery [29]. Studies have also compared PET and PET/CT in the detection of CRC recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of PET were 80%, 69%, and 75%, respectively, compared with 89%, 92%, and 90%, respectively, for PET/CT [30]. Another study demonstrated superiority of PET/CT over PET in differentiating malignant from benign lesions and physiologic activities [31]. The most common cause for false-positive interpretation of PET findings was physiologic FDG uptake in pelvic organs.In our study, histopathological analysis following PET scan demonstrated tumor recurrence or metastasis in 27 of 39 patients who have normal CEA but clinically and/or radiologically suspicious tumor recurrence. Twelve patients were tumor free. PET was true positive in 22 patients and true negative in eight patients. The accuracy of PET was 76.9%. Our results demonstrated that PET was most accurate for liver metastases with a positive predictive value 88.8%. For local recurrence, PET had PPV of 73.3%. PET was false negative in five patients. In three of these patients pathology was consistent with mucinous carcinoma with signet cells. Consistent with our findings, it has been reported that the sensitivity of FDG-PET imaging for detection of mucinous carcinoma is significantly lower than in nonmucinous carcinoma (58% and 92%, respectively) [8]. PET was false positive in four patients. False positive PET lesions were mainly in the bowel and were secondary to infectious or inflammatory/granulomatous processes. False-positive findings with FDG-PET in colorectal region are not uncommon [32]. Increased FDG uptake is observed at recent incision and biopsy sites, around drainage tubes and catheters, and at colostomy sites, as well as in association with colitis, abscesses, fistulas, diverticulitis, and in some benign adenomas. This is because of increased glucose use in activated macrophages, neutrophils, and fibroblasts within infectious, inflammatory, and granulomatous tissues. Normal FDG uptake in the gastrointestinal tract may also cause difficulty to differentiate normal physiologic uptake from recurrent tumor.There are many factors affecting the serum concentration of CEA, including tumor location, proximity to large vessels, degree of de-differentiation, access to portal circulation, tumor distribution, and tumor burden. Previously Moertel et al reported the inadequacy of CEA for early detection of tumor recurrence [23]. Only 25% of the patients had abnormal CEA levels although most patients had symptoms of recurrence for several months in their study. In two of our patients, CEA became positive 2 months after PET scan, suggesting that PET can show tumor recurrence earlier than CEA elevation. In our study, the lesion size was measured in focal solitary liver metastases in six patients. The tumor size ranged from 10 mm to 30 mm. However, our data is not sufficient to find the smallest tumor volume where PET can be positive while CEA negative. There are also many other factors in addition to tumor size affecting CEA level. However, we assume that given directly imaging the tumor and high glucose metabolism in tumor tissue, as well as current high-resolution PET/CT cameras, it is expected that FDG-PET may detect tumor recurrence before significant increase in CEA level.Although PET facilitates the evaluation of metabolic characteristics of tumors, it is limited in its ability to visualize anatomical structures. A PET/CT camera is the combination of PET and CT cameras which allows more accurate registration of metabolic findings in tumor with anatomical findings, adding further information to the diagnosis and staging of tumors. In PET/CT cameras, CT is also used for attenuation correction of PET images which significantly reduces imaging time. In our study, the accuracy of PET/CT was found to be lower than PET alone. However, given the smaller number of exams performed by PET/CT than by PET alone, this determination of accuracy may not reliably reflect the actual accuracy of PET/CT versus PET alone.Our study had several potential limitations. The first potential limitation was our small sample size which may have limited the robustness of our study in terms of statistics. The second potential limitation was the retrospective nature of our study. Because of its retrospective nature, we were unable to obtain baseline clinical and laboratory data in some of the patients. The third potential limitation was the pooled nature of the PET and PET/CT data, given that different attenuation correction algorithms were used in these two imaging methods. However, this issue would be of more concern had we compared PET SUVmax to PET/CT SUVmax in the same given patient. In defense of this third potential limitation, there is recently published study pooling PET and PET/CT SUV results [33]. The fourth potential limitation was our inability to use oral contrast for the combined PET/CT studies, since some data is available which demonstrates that low density oral contrast administration during combined PET/CT studies further increases accuracy."
1,Colorectal cancer treatment in octogenarians: elective or emergency surgery?,"Today, the population is getting older worldwide, with an ever-increasing number of people developing cancer. In this elderly group, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a predominant disease, and about half of all cases occur in patients over 70-years-old. Furthermore, CRC is the second most common cause of cancer death [1].Treatment of CRC is surgical resection of the primary tumor whenever possible, either for cure or palliation, to avoid late complications, such as obstruction and perforation. Elderly patients may be at risk for later stage and emergent presentation because of insufficient screening, unrecognized symptoms, not deciding whether to receive surgery and inadequate overall access to the healthcare system. Clinical condition is poorer in octogenarian patients with more concomitant illnesses and poorer physiological reserves. Few publications that there are that have reported on outcomes of surgical care of CRC in octogenarian patients have had confused conclusions, and clearly defined guidelines for treatment are lacking [2, 3]. It is difficult for surgeons to decide whether and which surgery is justified in these patients with a limited life expectancy.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the characteristics in octogenarian patients with CRC. Additionally, we wished to compare specific outcomes due to different types of surgical procedure used to treat CRC in this complex patient group, following elective or emergency surgery.","We studied retrospective data of consecutive elderly patients aged 80 years or over, who were diagnosed with CRC and were admitted to the General Surgery Department of the Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital between April 2000 and April 2010. A total of 346 patients were included in this study and all received surgical intervention for CRC. The intention of surgery in all cases was curative resection if at all possible. We excluded patients who had endoscopic treatment only. Of these 346 cases, 261 with non-urgent presentations, such as abdominal pain, blood in stool, anaemia, change in bowel habit, mass and weight loss received elective operation and were classed as the elective group. Other 75 patients with acute colonic obstruction and 10 patients with perforation who were classed as the emergent group. Of the patients who presented with acute colonic obstruction, an emergent operation was performed in 64 (85.3%) patients and 11 (14.7%) received self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) as a bridge to surgery. SEMS’ were placed as described previously [4]. All patients’ diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma were histologically proven.Data regarding the patient’s clinical features, comorbidities, presentation, method of diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading, location of tumor, type of treatment, Dukes’ staging, treatment outcomes including major 30-day morbidity and mortality, information concerning ICU admission, length of hospital stay and overall survival were collected.We classified perioperative complications as surgical (bleeding, surgical site infection, anastomotic leak, wound dehiscence and bowel obstruction) or medical (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, renal failure, multiorgan failure and suffocation). Mortality was defined as that occurring within 30 days postoperatively or before discharge if the patients stayed in the hospital was more than 30 days. Survival was calculated from the time of surgery and survival data were maintained with regular follow-up contact.All treatment interventions applied in this study including SEMS are officially approved, and are routine therapeutic options for old patients in China. Accordingly, prior to the initiation of the treatments, this work was approved by ethics committee at Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated The Six People’s Hospital.","A total of 346 patients were included in this study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age was 83.5 (range: 80 to 92) years in elective group and 84.7 (range: 80 to 95) years in emergent group. Comorbidities were similar. A significant difference was found in disease presentation, method of diagnosis and ASA grading. Most patients (83.5%) in elective group and 100% patients in emergent group presented with symptoms that prompted a diagnostic evaluation. Of the 261 patients who received elective surgery, 87.4%, 12.6% and 8.8% were diagnosed by colonoscopy, screening colonoscopy and computerized tomography scan, respectively. These conditions were seen in 43.5%, 0.0% and 100.0% of in patients undergoing emergent procedures, respectively. Only 33 (9.5%) patients who did not have any symptoms were diagnosed by screening colonoscopy in both groups. A higher number of high-risk patients (28.2% of ASA stage IV and 3.5% of ASA stage V) were found in emergent group.Table 1

Full size tableSurgical observations are shown in Table 2. A higher number of resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) (80.1% vs 40.2%), and lower number of resection and stoma (RS) (9.6% vs 30.6%) were performed in elective group. The rate of palliative surgery was similar in the two groups. The data show that patients in emergent group presented with advanced Dukes’ stage tumors compared to the emergent group (50.6% C and 24.7% D stage versus 30.3% C and 16.9% D stage).Table 2

Full size tableThe overall complication rate was significantly higher in the emergent group (71.8% vs 43.3%) (Table 3). Medical complications were more frequent in patients who received emergent surgery (67.0% vs 41.8%) and lower surgical complications were found in the elective group (7.7% vs 15.3%). Emergency was also associated with an increased length of hospital stay and higher rate of admission to ICU. Patients undergoing emergent procedures stayed, on average, nine more days in hospital and 82.4% of patients required ICU admission. The overall mortality was 9.5%, with an obviously higher mortality in emergent group (30.6%) than elective group (3.1%).Table 3 
                        Comparison of outcomes between elective and emergent surgical procedures
Full size tableAcute bowel obstruction was the major complication of CRC in octogenarian patients. In emergent group, 75 (88.2%) patients presented with acute colonic obstruction and 11 received SEMS. Table 4 shows the outcomes of SEMS compared to emergent surgery. A lower rate of overall complication (76.6% vs 36.4%) and medical complication (68.8% vs 27.3%) was found. The rate of stoma creation was higher in patients in the emergent group (50.0% vs 9.1%). It appears that mortality was lower in patients who received SEMS treatment (31.3% vs 9.1%), but this data were not significant.Patients were followed up for an average of 36.0 months (range: 2.0 to 60.0 months). The overall median survival was 25.6 months. When overall survival was analyzed by type of procedure, patients in elective group had a median survival of 31.7 months, a one-year survival rate of 75.5% and a three-year survival rate of 46.4%. In comparison, patients in the emergent group had a dramatic decrease in overall median survival of 10.8 months, a one-year survival rate of 43.5% and a three-year survival rate of 12.9%. Patients received SEMS had a similar overall median (11.5 months) and survival rate 90.9% as emergent group (Figure 1).Table 4

Full size tableFigure 1Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival for octogenarian patients by procedures. SEMS, self-expanding metal stent.Full size image","Colorectal cancer is a predominantly a disease of elderly people and is a major cause of mortality in the elderly population [2]. Historically, it was suggested that octogenarian patients do not fare well after surgery for CRC, with high rates of emergency presentations, higher postoperative morbidity and mortality. Analysis of several recently published reports shows that elective CRC resection in the elderly population is worthwhile and should be carried out for the same indications as for younger patients [5, 6]. The present study is to assess the characteristics of and compare specific outcomes of elective or emergent surgery in this complex octogenarians group.As the human body gets old, cumulative physiologic stressors lead to overall decline in organ and tissue function. Physiologic reserves are significantly diminished in octogenarians, and cardiovascular, pulmonary and endocrine comorbidities are common. In a study of 2932 patients ≥ 80 years old with CRC, Frank Marusch et al. showed 85% of these patients had a cardiovascular risk factor, and pulmonary comorbidity was found in 25.9% patients [7]. Our study revealed that the rate of having co-existing medical disease was 64.8% in the elective group and 84.8% in emergent group. Hypertension, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) and chronic heart disease were the major comorbidities. This led to high rate of ASA stage ≥ 3 categories, with 42.9% in elective group and 59.8% in emergent group. Additional stress caused by the emergency and later tumor stage led to significantly higher of ASA score in octogenarian patients with emergent presentation.As previous reports, the current study also revealed an age-related shift toward the colon in the distribution of CRC, and up to 40% of cancers were located in the right colon [8, 9]. Acute mechanical bowel obstruction, which was the most common complication and is a clinical indicator of locally advance disease, was more frequent in octogenarian patients. Glancarlo Basili et al. emergency surgery for CRC was carried out in 16% of elderly patients, compared with 4% in the younger group [10]. None of the patients in emergent group were firstly found by colonoscopy screening in our study. Colonoscopy should be recommended as method of choice in octogenarian patients if CRC is suspected. Although the literature concerning screening colonoscopy in the octogenarians is limited, several studies have suggested that a screening colonoscopy may improve poor outcomes by discovering CRC at an earlier stage [11, 12].As previous reports, for emergent surgery in the unprepared colon, RS is still one of the best operative alternatives in octogenarian patients [13–15]. In our research, a higher number of RPA (80.1% vs 41.2%) and a lower number of RS (9.6% vs 30.6%) were performed in the elective group compared to the emergent group. It is important to consider that the choice of procedure was not randomized, rather, RPA was only carried out when the surgeons believed that local and systemic conditions of the octogenarian patients were appropriate. The high rate of stoma might be attributed to hemodynamically unstable states and lower physiological reserves in the emergent group. RPA was used for 244 out of 346 patients in this study, and 11 (3.2%) of these patients presented with anastomotic dehiscence. There were no differences in anastomotic dehiscence between the elective and emergent group. Compared to 3.0% and 6.3% reported in previous series’ [13, 14], the anastomotic dehiscence rate was not higher in these octogenarian patients. RPA should be encouraged when the over-all physical condition of the patients is appropriate.Surgery for CRC in octogenarian patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The risk of postoperative death rises to 11.9 –38.0% after emergency surgery and 7.4– 11.4% in elective cases [10], making the postoperative mortality rates of present study acceptable. Emergent management of CRC complications, such as obstructing and perforation, remains strongly associated with poorer outcomes in octogenarian patients. The reasons for this are to be seen in a reduced patient status and inadequate preoperative preparation. Ozturk and Yilmazlar reported in a multivariate logistic regression analysis that colorectal disease increased the risk of death by nine-fold in elderly patients undergoing surgery [16]. Emergency surgery, a well-known risk factor, increases operative mortality rates between three-fold- and 10-fold. This research confirm the results of previously published studies, in which morbidity rates of 25– 81% and mortality rates of 17– 30% have been reported [17–20]. Emergency status also caused a significant increase in length of stay and ICU admission.Compared to elective group, patients had a lower survival; in emergent group, 43.5% versus 75.5% at 1 year and, 12.7% vs 46.4% at 3 years. This survival is also considerably lower than general population after colorectal surgery. These results may partly be explained by the fact that octogenarian patients, especially in emergent group, were more likely to present with a later stage of the disease, were less likely to receive curative surgery, and had higher postoperative mortality. Long-term survival figures could also be affected by the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and these treatments may be offered differently according to age. However, most octogenarian patients in this studies did not receive adjuvant treatment.This retrospective study shows placement of SEMS to be an appealing option as a bridge to semi-elective surgery in octogenarian patients. Compared to emergent surgery, patients treated with SEMS had a significantly lower rate of complications. The mortality rate was 31.3% in the emergent group and 9.1% in patients received SEMS treatment. However, there was no significant difference. This factor may have reached significance if the study population was larger. Among patients who received SEMS, this study showed a marked reduction in stoma formation. SEMS provides a useful alternative to emergent surgical intervention in the management of acute colorectal obstruction for octogenarian patients [4].The term ‘getting old’ may be defined as ‘an inherent, progressive impairment of function with the passage of time, which cannot be averted, and which causes individuals to become more vulnerable to death’ [21]. But However, it is difficult to define an age limit age that this occurs. As indicated in most previous studies regarding this definition, the physiological and chronic health status of the patient are much more important than the chronological age. Although advancing age is an independent risk factor for postoperative death in elderly patients undergoing colonic resection for cancer [22], in order to prevent high mortality, it should be emphasized that in octogenarians patients who require an operation for colorectal cancer, the operation should be performed as soon as conditions are optimized and should not be postponed. Age should not be a contraindication for surgery. A screening colonoscopy may improve poor outcomes in the octogenarian patients by discovering CRC at an earlier stage. Although emergency operations were associated with a poorer outcome, most patients in our study survived and left the hospital. When emergency of CRC occurs, identifying these high-risk patients and treating them promptly rather than delaying or denying surgery is the best option. SEMS may provide a useful alternative to emergent surgical intervention in the management of acute left-sided colorectal obstruction for octogenarian patients."
2,Outcomes of resection and non-resection strategies in management of patients with advanced colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in the Western world. In the UK approximately 34000 patients have newly diagnosed colorectal cancer each year[1]. Between 20–30% are found to have synchronous distant metastases at the time of diagnosis [2, 3]. A small, select group will be suitable for resection of hepatic metastases whereas the remaining majority are deemed surgically incurable. The aim of treatment in the majority of patients with advanced disease is palliation with a view to optimise quality of life (QoL) and survival time[4].Patients diagnosed with Stage IV disease CRC present a common clinical dilemma. It has been recommended that optimal palliation can be achieved by resection of the primary, in order to pre-empt potential complications such as obstruction, perforation or haemorrhage, and possibly prolong survival [5, 6]. However surgery, even in a non-urgent situation, carries significant risks of mortality and many patients with stage IV disease may die from progressive systemic disease before the development of any primary tumour specific complication [7, 8].The aim of this retrospective study is to review the impact of non-operative management of advanced CRC in an unselected, consecutive series of patients presenting with newly diagnosed disease. It reviews and compares the outcomes of patients with advanced bowel cancer treated with different treatment strategies, in a single colorectal unit, over a 7-year period.","Patients diagnosed with primary CRC between January 1999 and April 2006 were identified from the prospectively collected information held in a local copy of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland colorectal cancer database. All patients underwent colonic imaging (Barium enema or colonoscopy), and staging with Computerised Tomography of the abdomen and chest x-ray. Patients diagnosed with rectal carcinoma, who were otherwise fit for surgery, also underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the pelvis. Data collected included demographic data, ASA score of operated patients, stoma rates in operated patients and the indications for surgery in emergency patients. Patients deemed surgically incurable at presentation were studied. Patients with metastatic liver disease in whom curative treatment was carried out (primary tumour and hepatic resection) were excluded in this study.The management plan for all patients, other than those treated by emergency surgery, was agreed at the weekly multi-disciplinary team meeting. The three treatment options for discussion with the patient were: resection of the primary lesion (resection group), non-resectional treatment which included non-resectional surgery, the use of self-expandable metallic stent and oncological treatment alone (non-resection group) and patients receiving symptomatic treatment only (supportive group). Advice regarding surgical resection versus non-resection treatment was based on two factors: presence of symptoms (bleeding, perforation or obstruction), and fitness for surgery. Those patients who were unfit for any active intervention or who presented with terminal disease were managed with supportive care. The study end point was survival on an intention to treat basis. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare survival between the sub-groups and Mann-Whitney U test used to compare demographic data.","A total of 646 consecutive newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients were identified from the database during the study period, 166 (26%) of whom were identified as stage IV at presentation. Of the patients with stage IV disease 12 (7%) had liver metastases at presentation and underwent potentially curative liver resection, so are excluded from further analysis. 154 (93%) of stage IV patients were diagnosed with advanced, surgically incurable disease at presentation, based on clinical examination and CT scan findings. Forty-five patients (29%) had a surgical resection of the primary tumour, fifty-two patients (34%) had active non-resectional treatment and fifty-seven patients (37%) received supportive care alone.In patients with stage IV disease, 145 have died during the study period with an overall median survival time of 5 months (interquartile range 1–14 months). 2 patients treated with resection are alive at 16 and 17 months post resection, 5 patients treated with chemotherapy are alive at 11, 15, 23, 28 and 29 months post diagnosis and 2 patients managed with supportive care alone are alive at 9 and 17 months. Overall follow up is as follows: 145 patients were followed until death and the remaining 9 patients for a median of 17 months (range 11–29 months). The age and median survival by treatment modality utilised is summarised in table 1.Table 1 Survival by treatment modalityFull size tablePatients treated by resection of the primary had the longest survival but this was not significantly longer than those treated by active, non-resectional intervention (p = 0.2056) but was significantly greater than the group treated with supportive care alone (p < 0.0001), Kaplan-Meier curve figure 1. The median age of patients undergoing resection was significantly lower than those treated with supportive care (p = 0.026) but not different from those offered active non-resectional treatment (p = 0.575). Of those patients undergoing resection, 28 were performed electively and 17 as an emergency (12 for bowel obstruction and 5 for faecal peritonitis). No difference in survival was observed between patients operated electively and those having emergency resection (median survival elective 12 months, IQ range 3–18, versus emergency resection median survival 10 months, IQ range 1–18, log-rank p = 0.95). Of those patients having elective resection 71% were ASA grade I or II. Of those patients having emergency resection 29% were ASA grade I or II. Stoma rates were 32% (9/28) in elective cases and 53% (9/17) in the emergency setting. The operative mortality in patients undergoing elective resection was 14% (4/28) patients and 18% (3/17) in patients having an emergency resection. No difference in age or survival was seen when elective and emergency resections were compared.Figure 1Survival by treatment modalities.Full size imageNon-resection intervention treatments included non-resection surgery (defunctioning stoma/bypass), chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stent. Table 2 summarises the number of cases, median age and survival for each modality. The operative mortality for non-resection surgery, stoma formation or bypass, was 36% (5/14). Of the 52 patients initially treated without resection only 1 patient underwent abdominal surgery prior to death – faecal diversion 47 months following diagnosis and treatment with chemotherapy. Two further patients had radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction, at 6 and 18 months post diagnosis, but neither underwent surgery prior to death. 9 patients required blood transfusion to treat symptomatic anaemia (1 patient required 5 admissions for transfusion, 2 patients required 2 admissions and 6 patients required a single admission).Table 2 Summary of non-resectional interventionFull size table","The management of patients with stage IV CRC with unresectable secondary disease remains challenging. Individual treatment needs to be tailored to optimise QoL and survival taking into account the side effects and risks of any active intervention. In patients that present requiring emergency surgery, due to perforation or bleeding, the decision is usually, although by no means always, straightforward. However in those patients presenting with non-distressing symptoms, does resection of the primary tumour offer a survival benefit and does resection prevent the onset of symptoms due to tumour complications?This non-case-matched study has compared the survival of patients treated with resection of their primary against non-resection intervention and supportive care on an intention to treat basis. It has found that patients who undergo resection of their primary disease have the longest survival, however, this was not significantly better than those patients having active non-surgical treatment (p = 0.21). Patients treated with supportive treatment alone only were observed to have significantly worse survival than those treated by primary resection and non-resection intervention (p < 0.001).Recommendations on management of elective cases in this series were made to patients based on multi-disciplinary team discussion that would have been guided by patient symptoms and fitness, metastatic burden of disease and patient choice. Patients undergoing surgery were either symptomatic from their disease or physiologically fitter than those patients treated with non-resectional measures, confirmed by 71% of elective surgery patients having an ASA status of I or II and a median age of 72. The elective operative mortality of 14% is high but given the small number of patients in this series is in keeping with the figure of 12% reported in the ACPGBI national audit[9]. This level of postoperative mortality is an important consideration when counselling patients for surgery with stage IV disease.In this series patients managed with supportive care only experienced poor survival, the median being 2 months and 18% (10 of 57 cases) of patients surviving less than 1 month from diagnosis. This self selected group of patients treated with supportive care alone were those with very advanced disease or who were physiologically unfit to undergo any from of anti-cancer treatment.During the course of this series there have been several changes in the management of stage IV CRC both in palliative treatments and an increased role for potentially curative hepatic resection. The number of patients considered suitable to undergo liver resection has increased as new surgical therapies have been introduced[10]. In addition new chemotherapeutic agents have been employed that have increased the feasibility of curative hepatic resection and significantly improved median survival for patients with surgically incurable CRC[11]. Therefore it is likely that some of the patients in this series and previous reported series would today be candidates for more aggressive liver surgery or use of newer chemotherapy regimens that may improve the survival of both non-resection and resection treatment groups in this series.One of the concerns in managing patients with surgically incurable CRC without resection of the primary tumour is the risk of the patient presenting acutely with obstruction, bleeding or perforation either at the time of diagnosis or subsequently. In this series only 1 patient (2%) patient underwent surgery following an initial decision not to resect the primary tumour. This was for bowel obstruction not manageable by a stent. However a further 2 patients (4%) had radiographic bowel obstruction that was managed without surgery and 9 (17%) required blood transfusion to treat anaemia.For patients presenting with malignant large bowel obstruction there is an increased trend in the use of self expandable metallic stents (SEMS). A recent systematic review examined the role of SEMS in this situation and showed successful palliation in 90% of 336 reported cases with technical failure reported in 8% of cases and perforation in 4% [12]. In this series the technique of stenting was introduced and developed in the unit during the study period and in the future may reduce the need for emergency surgical intervention and stoma formation in patients presenting with malignant large bowel obstruction.Survival in metastatic CRC treated by resection and non-resection strategies are unlikely to be compared in a randomised control trial. The survival results of seven recent studies are summarised in table 3. Whether resection of the primary tumour affords a survival advantage is contentious in theses series. Some previous studies have shown a survival benefit from resection of the primary [13–15] although in each of these series the non-resection group appears to include patients who were managed with supportive care alone, which may have biased the results in favour of resection, which was a factor in our decision to divide management strategies employed, in this series, into three groups rather than two. In this series, if the survival of patients undergoing resection of their primary is compared with a combined group of patients managed with non-resectional intervention and supportive care a survival benefit is observed from resecting the primary (median 11 (IQ range 3–18) versus 3 months (IQ range 1–10 months), p = 0.006)Table 3 Comparison of survival of patients treated with resection and non-resectionFull size tableThere are other potential confounding factors in some studies where the results favour resection. For example, patients treated by resection were found to have a significantly lower burden of disease in one study[13], and the impact of case selection was not recorded in the others[14, 15]. Tebutt et al, have also showed improved survival in patients treated by resection against non-resection although this was not significant on multi-variate analysis (p = 0.08) although peritoneal disease, performance status, alkaline phosphotase and albumin were[16]. The remaining three studies have failed to show a survival benefit from either strategy [17–19].Palliative chemotherapy is the only treatment modality which has been shown to improve survival of patients with surgically incurable disease[20]. Therefore it has been previously advocated that asymptomatic patients with surgically incurable disease should proceed direct to chemotherapy without resection of their primary tumour. The rationale behind this treatment strategy relates to the fact that patients are more likely to die of disease progression than any tumour specific complication and operative intervention will delay commencement of chemotherapy whilst post-operative recovery occurs [7, 8, 19, 21].Quality of life is of paramount importance to patients with advanced CRC and although multidisciplinary teams would consider this in tailoring individual treatment, the lack of prospectively collected QoL data, like in other similar studies, remains a limitation in this study."
