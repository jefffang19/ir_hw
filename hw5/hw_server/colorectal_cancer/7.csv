0,Estimating probability of germline mismatch repair mutations in colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite stable tumors,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and is an established screening tool for identifying Lynch syndrome in colorectal cancer populations [1]. However, MSI testing is neither perfectly sensitive nor specific to detect Lynch Syndrome, and germline MMR mutations have been reported in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors [2]. The value of germline MMR testing in patients with MSS tumors may vary based on family history, and data is needed to guide choices about when to offer testing in high risk clinic settings.","From 2002-2009, high risk patients presenting to the Cancer Genetics Clinics at the University of Michigan and the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain were evaluated for Lynch syndrome and included in the present study. Patients with MSS colorectal tumors who also had germline MMR testing were eligible for analysis. We calculated risk for MMR mutation using MMRPro v.5.1[3] at baseline, after MSI testing, and after germline MMR testing. Modified likelihood ratios were estimated to evaluate the utility of germline testing in patients with MSS tumors based on the strength of the family history [4].","Germline MMR mutations were identified in 5/44 (11.4%) patients with MSS tumors. Two of the mutations were identified in patients from families that met the Amsterdam Criteria (AC I/II), whereas 3 mutations were found in patients from families that were AC I/II negative. The modified likelihood for a germline mutation (+LRmod) in an AC I/II patient was 1.56 (95% CI: 0.47 - 5.18) and the modified negative likelihood ratio (-LRmod) for a patient not meeting the AC I/II criteria was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.39 - 1.69). We quantified the meaning of the AC I/II criteria to guide clinical choices about genetic testing in MSS tumors by multiplying the pretest odds by the +LRmod and the -LRmod. The probability of a mutation was modified from a baseline of 11.4% to 16.7% in AC I/II families, compared to 9.4% in AC I/II-negative families.","Germline MMR testing in high risk patients with MSS colorectal tumors identifies mutations in a small, but meaningful proportion of patients. The diagnostic yield is dependent on the strength of the family history. Modified likelihood ratios can be helpful to quantify the probability of a positive gene test for Lynch Syndrome, and can be applied to pre-test probabilities derived from clinical models."
1,Metachronous colorectal cancer risk for mismatch repair gene mutation carriers – the advantage of more extensive surgery,"Appropriate surgical management of colorectal cancers (CRC) in Lynch Syndrome patients, i.e. carriers of germline mutation in a mismatch repair (MMR) gene, is controversial. The decision to remove more or less of the colon requires the consideration of relatively high risk of metachronous CRC with the functional consequence of more extensive surgery. Our aim was to estimate and compare the risks of metachronous CRC for MMR gene mutation carriers following segmental versus extensive removal of colon for their first colon cancer.","Risk of metachronous CRC was estimated for 382 carriers of MMR gene (172 MLH1, 167 MSH2, 23 MSH6 and 20 PMS2) mutations from the Colon Cancer Family Registry, who had colorectal surgery for their first colon cancer. Age-dependent cumulative risks were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between the length of bowel removed and metachronous CRC risk.","Of 50 individuals who had extensive (subtotal or total) colectomy for first colon cancer, none were diagnosed with metachronous CRC over 414 person-years (incidence rate, 95% confidence interval, CI 0–7.2 per 1000 person-years). Of 332 individuals who had segmental colorectal resection for first colon cancer, there were 79 (24%) diagnoses of metachronous CRC over 3,131 person-years (incidence rate 25.2 per 1000 person-years; 95%CI 20.2–31.5 per 1000 person-years). This incidence rate was statistically different from that for individuals who had extensive surgery (P <0.001). Cumulative risk of metachronous CRC was 20% (95%CI 15–26%) at 10 years, 44% (95%CI 35–55%) at 20 years and 66% (95%CI 52–78%) at 30 years after segmental colectomy for a first colon cancer. Risk of metachronous CRC reduced by 24% (95%CI 4–40%; P 0.02) for every 10 cm of bowel removed. There was no difference in the frequency of colonoscopy after surgery for first colon cancer between extensive and segmental resection (one colonoscopy per 16 (95%CI 13–20) months after extensive resection compared to one colonoscopy per 20 (95%CI 18–21) months after segmental resection; P 0.2).",Lynch Syndrome patients with colon cancer who have had a segmental colorectal resection have a high cumulative risk for a metachronous CRC. Patients with more extensive resection of the first colon cancer had a lower risk of metachronous CRC compared to less extensive surgery. These findings will better inform decision making about the extent of primary surgical resection.
2,"Chromosome 8q23.3, 10p14 and 11q23.1 variants modify colorectal cancer risk in Lynch syndrome – a combined analysis of the Australian, Dutch and Polish Lynch syndrome cohorts","For a decade researchers have been searching for modifier genes in individuals with a molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome but the task has proven difficult as discordant results seem to be the rule rather than the exception. Recently, two colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility loci have been found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC in Dutch Lynch syndrome patients irrespective of which gene was mutated. In a combined study of CRC risk in Australian and Polish Lynch syndrome patients only MLH1 mutation carriers were found to be at increased risk of disease. A combined analysis of the three datasets was performed to better define this association.","The three populations combined totalled 1359 individuals from 425 families with a molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. To date, this represents the largest Lynch syndrome cohort examined for modifier genes. Seven SNPs, from 6 different CRC susceptibility loci, were genotyped by both research groups and the data analysed collectively.","Individuals with MLH1 mutations harbouring the CC (variant) genotype of SNP rs3802842 are at increased risk of CRC (HR=2.77, p<0.001) and develop CRC on average 11 years earlier than individuals with the AA (wild type) genotype. All females (MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 mutation carriers) carrying the CC genotype of SNP rs3802842 are at increased risk of CRC (HR=2.16, p=0.005), while female MLH1 mutation carriers are at highest risk (HR=3.88, p<0.001).To investigate whether a cluster of risk alleles increases the risk of CRC, SNP rs3802842 was combined with the other six SNPs additively. MLH1 mutation carriers harbouring 3 risk alleles for SNP combination; rs3802842 (11q23.1) + rs16892766 (8q23.3) display an increased risk of CRC (HR=5.67, p=0.001) and an immense difference in the age of diagnosis of CRC of 28 years is observed compared to individuals with 0 risk alleles. While SNP combination; rs3802842 + rs10795668 (10p14) displays an increased risk of CRC for all females harbouring 4 risk alleles (HR=5.52, p=0.003).",These results confirm the role of modifier genes in HNPCC. We recommend that Lynch syndrome patients with MLH1 mutations and all Lynch syndrome females are genotyped for two SNPs in each group so that a personalised risk assessment and tailored surveillance program can be offered to patients at increased risk of CRC and therefore likely to develop their CRCs at much younger ages than the average age of disease onset.
3,The multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene polymorphism G-rs3789243-A is not associated with disease susceptibility in Norwegian patients with colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer; a case control study,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the Western World, with great impact on the life quality of the affected persons [1]. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis, and gene-environmental interactions may modulate cancer risk. Multiple low-penetrance genes have been shown to confer susceptibility to CRC [2]. Diet components, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking are risk factors for CRC [3–6]. High-fat and low-fibre diets, red and processed meat consumption, and tobacco are all sources of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) [7–9]. Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking induce inflammation and may thereby contribute to carcinogenesis [10].Genetic factors may influence the individual risk of gastrointestinal cancer when exposed to endogenous or exogenous carcinogens. The multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1/ABCB1) gene codes for P-glycoprotein, a membrane-bound transporter [11, 12]. P-glycoprotein is abundant in the intestine [13, 14] and transports a broad spectrum of substrates to the intestinal lumen [15], thereby constituting a part of the gastrointestinal barrier that protects the lining cells against xenobiotics, including possible carcinogens. One of the most potent animal PAH carcinogens, benzo [a]pyrene, may be a P-glycoprotein substrate [16]. Also various cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta, and chemokines involved in inflammation seem to be P-glycoprotein substrates [17], thus making a potential link between P-glycoprotein function and inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. MDR1 also seems to play a role in early carcinogenesis [18] by preventing apoptosis in tumor cells [17, 19].Significant MDR1 gene heterogeneity has been demonstrated [20, 21]. The MDR1 C3435T polymorphism has been associated with low in vivo P-glycoprotein intestinal expression and activity in Caucasian subjects [22]. This is in accordance with the demonstration of an association of the variant allele with a lower mRNA stability [23]. This variant allele has been associated with higher risk of various clinical conditions [24], gastrointestinal cancers [25, 26], and possibly colorectal cancer [27], although, generally, numbers of study participants in these studies have been small. However, results from other studies have been inconsistent [28–32], indicating that other causal polymorphism(s) may be implicated. Recently, we have demonstrated that carriers of the variant allele of MDR1 intron 3 (G-rs3789243-A) were at 1.54-fold higher risk of colorectal cancer than homozygous wild type carriers (95% CI: 1.13–2.08) in a case-cohort study nested in the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study (V. Andersen et al, submitted). This variant has previously been found to be associated with the risk of ulcerative colitis by the use of a haplotype tagging approach [33]. So far, the SNP has no known functional effects [33].We wished to explore the role of the xenobiotic transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 gene and known to transport dietary carcinogens, in CRC etiology. Nearly all colon cancers begin as benign polyps which slowly develop into cancer. We speculated that the uptake of dietary carcinogens via P-glycoprotein may be involved in this process. Therefore, the role of genetic variation in MDR1 intron 3 (G-rs3789243-A) in relation to the risk of developing colorectal adenomas and carcinomas was assessed in the Norwegian population using a case-control study of 167 carcinomas, 990 adenomas, and 400 controls.","The KAM (Kolorektal cancer, Arv og Miljø) cohort is based on the screening group of the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention study (the NORCCAP study) in the county of Telemark and a series of clinical CRC cases operated at Telemark Hospital (Skien) and Ulleval University Hospital (Oslo) [34, 35]. In short, 20.780 healthy men and women, age 50–64 years of age, drawn at random from the population registry in Oslo (urban) and the county of Telemark (mixed urban and rural) were invited to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy screening examination. The KAM cohort is based on an ethnically homogeneous group of Norwegian origin.The KAM biobank consists of samples from individuals identified with adenomas in the large intestine (1044 accepted; 991 high- and low-risk adenomas (a high-risk adenoma being defined as an adenoma measuring at least 10 mm in diameter and/or with villous components and/or showing severe dysplasia), and 53 hyperplastic polyps), and controls, defined as individuals with normal findings at flexible sigmoidoscopy screening (400 accepted), together with 167 cases identified with colorectal cancer. All of the participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, health status, dietary and smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical exercise and occupation. The questionnaire contained information on a family history of adenomas and carcinomas, and the included cases and controls had no known personal history of genetic predisposition. In the present study, blood samples were available from 167 cases with carcinomas, 990 cases with adenomas (229 high-risk and 761 low-risk adenomas) and 400 controls. All participants gave verbal and written informed consent.The study was done in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The Regional Ethics Committee and the Data Inspectorate approved the KAM study. The ID number for the study is NCT00119912 at ClinicalTrials.gov [36].The distribution of age, gender, smoking, and alcohol consumption among cases and controls are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Characteristics of study participants with colorectal carcinomas and high- and low-risk adenomas and healthy controls, in total 1557 subjects.Full size table
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples according to standard procedures [37] with minor modifications as already described [38]. All analyses were run blinded to the case-control status. MDR1 G-rs3789243-A [GenBank:rs3789243]genotyping was performed on an Mx3000 machine (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), using allelic discrimination with TaqMan chemistry, as earlier described [39]. In short, QPCR was done in 25 μl reactions including 20 ng DNA and 900 nM primers and 200 nM probes with locked nucleic acid (LNA) incorporations. QPCR was run for 50 cycles with split annealing and elongation (62°C and 72°C, respectively). Controls were included in each run. Within each of the three genotype groups, 20 randomly selected samples were repeated to confirm reproducibility.The genotype frequencies were compared using a logistic regression model, measured as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Two separate ORs were calculated; one crude (OR^a) and one adjusted for age and gender (OR^b). In addition we analyzed for carriers of the polymorphism separately. MiniTab Statistical Software, Release 13.1 Xtra (Minitab Inc.) for Windows was used for the statistical calculations Given the allele frequency of 0.5, we had 80% chance of detecting an OR of approximately 1.7 in carcinomas and 1.5 in adenomas at a 5% significance level [40].","Characteristics of the study population and risk factors for CRC are shown in Table 1. Women were more frequent among the controls than among cases. Smoking was more frequent among cases than among controls. Moreover, the CRC cases were older than the controls. The genotype distribution among the controls did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No association was found between the MDR1 polymorphism (G-rs3789243-A) and the risk of colorectal adenomas or cancer (Table 2). Carriers of the variant allele in MDR1 intron 3 had ORs (95% CI) of 0.96 (0.72–1.29) for developing adenomas, and 0.70 (0.41–1.21) for developing colorectal cancer, respectively, compared to homozygous wild type carriers.Table 2 Odds Ratios for Colorectal Cancers and Colorectal Adenomas including high- and low-risk adenomas for MDR1 G-rs3789243-AFull size table
","We found no associations between the studied MDR1 polymorphism and the risk of colorectal adenomas or carcinomas in the present Norwegian study group. The risk of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas were not different for homozygous or heterozygous carriers of the variant genotype of MDR1 G-rs3789243-A compared with the homozygous wild type carriers. A power calculation showed that we had 80% chance of detecting an OR of approximately 1.7 in carcinomas and 1.5 in adenomas. The statistical power to look into interactions was therefore limited, and interaction studies were therefore not done.
MDR1 genotypes have previously been studied in relation to colorectal cancer susceptibility [27, 41, 42]. In contrast to the present study, variant allele carriers of the MDR1 G-rs3789243-A polymorphism have previously been associated with a risk of colorectal cancer in the Danish population (V. Andersen et al, submitted) and of ulcerative colitis in the Scottish population [33]. In the Danish study, carriers of the variant allele were at 1.54-fold higher risk of CRC compared with wild type carriers (95% CI: 1.13–2.08).The MDR1 C3435T polymorphism was studied in a Polish study population [27]. They found higher risk of CRC among variant carriers than homozygous wildtype carriers in a subgroup of younger persons. However, as the result was based on a subgroup consisting of about 50 persons the findings need to be replicated in a larger study. Furthermore, no association between this polymorphism and colon cancer was reported in a Korean study population [41].Several factors may contribute to the differences seen between the studies. First of all, the first report of genetic effects is likely to represent an overestimated odds ratios due to reporting bias [43]. Therefore, the association may be real but not reproduced due to a weak gene effect and limited power to detect such small gene effects in the Norwegian replication study.Population heterogeneity may also contribute. However, although MDR1 shows a high degree of heterogeneity between different population [20, 21, 44], it may be suggested that the Norwegian, Scottish and Danish population may share some common genetic background as it seems to be the case for CARD15 polymorphisms in European populations [45–47], where a low frequency of the CARD15 variants in the Northern countries compared to the rest of Europe has been demonstrated.Furthermore, differences in carcinogenic exposure may modify the inherent risk associated with genetic susceptibility. For instance, the average monthly intake of alcohol was 11 units, corresponding to 88 g alcohol per month among the controls in the present Norwegian [38] cohort, whereas the mean alcohol intake was 390 g per month among the controls in the Danish cohort [48]. Correspondingly, 47% and 34% of the controls were never smokers in the Norwegian and Danish studies, respectively. However, due to the restricted sample size such differences were not elaborated."
4,Colorectal cancer screening: will non-invasive procedures triumph?,"In the US, colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer, after breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and the second most deadly cancer after lung cancer; it will kill an estimated 50,310 Americans in 2014 [1]. Worldwide there are 1.4 million cases per year, making it the world's third most common cancer. But there is good news. In the US among people 50 years old and over, colorectal cancer incidence has been declining by 1.8% per year and mortality by 2.8% per year [1]. This is due to many factors, including improved treatments and adoption of healthier diets and other behaviors in this age group. But a large, and perhaps the largest, factor is widespread adoption of colorectal cancer screening among that age group. Almost two-thirds of that age group report using some form of colorectal cancer screening [1].Colorectal cancer screening was first evaluated by a study in Minnesota that started in 1975 and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 [2]. The investigators reported that after 13 years of follow-up, the group offered annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) had a 33% lower rate of death from colorectal cancer than the group not being offered any screening (the controls). A third group offered biennial (every 2 years) screening did not show any reduction at that time. However, 6 years later, after screening had stopped, the annual group still had a 33% lower mortality but the biennial group now showed a 21% lower mortality than the controls. Two other randomized trials of FOBT screening, one in the UK [3] and one in Denmark [4], studied biennial screening only and in 1996 confirmed reduced mortality levels in The Lancet.The original Minnesota trial reported in a later New England Journal of Medicine paper [5] that annual and biennial screening with FOBT led to 20% and 17% lower incidence (as well as lower mortality) of colorectal cancer, respectively, after 18 years of follow-up. More recently, three other randomized trials of colorectal cancer screening, using an endoscopic method called flexible sigmoidoscopy instead of FOBT, have also reported reductions in both colorectal cancer incidence and mortality using a single screen or two screens 3 to 5 years apart [6–8]. From these trials it is clear that colorectal cancer screening has the capacity to lower both incidence and mortality.","In the US, several groups, including the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, and the American College of Gastroenterology, have published guidelines for colorectal cancer screening [9]. They currently all recommend screening beginning at age 50 by one of three methods: colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or FOBT every year.FOBT is a test of stool samples for the presence of blood. Some are simple chemical tests (guaiac FOBT) and some are fecal immunochemical tests (FIT). Either form of FOBT is acceptable as long as it is sensitive enough to the presence of blood. The presence of blood is considered a positive test and indicates that the patient may have cancer or advanced pre-cancerous adenomas and requires follow-up with colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an endoscopic method used to visualize the whole colorectum. Flexible sigmoidoscopy examines only the lower part of the colon and rectum, and if cancer or adenomas are found, follow-up with colonoscopy is also required to complete the examination. Although randomized trials have not been done to show colonoscopy's benefits, the efficacy of both FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy depend on colonoscopy to follow up findings on those tests.Other tests that are available but not universally recommended are double-contrast barium-enema X-rays; 'virtual colonoscopy', a method of using computed tomography to visualize the colon using contrast media; and stool DNA tests that look for additional molecular biomarkers in the stool as well as occult blood. As more is learned about these methods, they may be more widely adopted.The effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening so far is demonstrated not only by the decline in mortality that exceeds what is expected from improved treatment, but also by the steady reductions in incidence that have been observed in the US since 2006. However, about a third of the people who can benefit from early detection of colorectal cancer are not getting screened [10], and some of them are suffering and dying needlessly.","Three recent studies, all in the New England Journal of Medicine [11–13], that received considerable attention have shifted our understanding of screening. The first was an analysis of the long-term effects of FOBT screening on colorectal cancer mortality in the original Minnesota trial [13]. That report found that the effects observed at 18 years have continued through 30 years of follow-up, even though the study-directed screening ended in 1993. This somewhat unexpected finding demonstrates that the impact of screening may last much longer than we had assumed, and this raises its value in preventing death and disease. In addition, the longer follow-up provided more power to look at the effects of screening within subgroups by age and sex, and found that there may be more benefit of earlier screening for men, whereas the benefit for women may be from later screening at an age older than 50.The second study used a cohort of individuals some of whom had undergone sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy during the 20-year follow-up period to evaluate the impact of that procedure on incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer [11]. Although such an approach does not eliminate the potential for biases from self-selection or lead-time, the investigators found evidence of a reduction in both incidence and mortality among those who underwent endoscopy compared with those who did not. In addition, there was evidence that cancers diagnosed within 5 years of endoscopy were more likely to be of the CpG island methylator phenotype than those diagnosed more than 5 years later [11]. This has implications not only for adjusting surveillance periods based on evaluation of pre-cancerous lesions, but also for the development of molecular markers for early detection.The third, most recent, study evaluated a test of DNA markers in stool [12]. Stools were collected and evaluated from nearly 10,000 individuals. A panel of DNA markers plus an FIT was compared with a stand-alone FIT for sensitivity to colorectal cancers and for advanced adenomas, and the DNA panel was found to be significantly more sensitive, though less specific (that is, it was more likely to identify a lesion, but was also more likely to misidentify a person without lesions as being positive for a lesion). A Food and Drug Administration panel has recently recommended approval of the test for early detection.","How to increase the uptake of colorectal cancer screening in the asymptomatic population for which it is intended has been the subject of much research. Unlike other cancers for which early detection is recommended, colorectal cancer offers a number of choices for screening methods. This is both a blessing and a curse: a blessing because it allows flexibility in addressing the preferences and concerns of an individual considering screening, but a curse because it makes the public health message about screening less tidy and potentially more confusing [14, 15]. A range of strategies have been studied, from directly mailing FOBT kits to screen eligible people to assigning 'navigators' for people who may be challenged in negotiating the options and restrictions of their own healthcare system. At this point, there is still much to be learned, as the proportion of the population using screening seems to have reached a plateau."
5,Overexpression of MACC1 leads to downstream activation of HGF/METand potentiates metastasis and recurrence of colorectal cancer,"To date, the most reliable prognostic indicator for colorectal cancer (CRC) has been stage, but discerning which of those patients with stage II or III disease will be among the 25-51% of cases to develop recurrent cancer and succumb to the disease remains one of the most problematic and frustrating issues concerning clinical care and cancer surveillance strategies for CRC patients. Recent guidelines by the European Group of Tumor Markers for the clinical use of CRC markers determined that currently only measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) every two to three months may be of value for recognizing recurrence in patients with stage II or III disease [1]. Other serum markers, including cancer antigen CA19.9, CA242 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1), or the tumor markers thymidylate synthase, microsatellite instability, p53, K-ras, and deleted in colon cancer (DCC) offer no advantage beyond the limited specificity and sensitivity of CEA for early detection of cancer recurrence [1]. Stein et al. [2] report the association of overexpression of MACC1 with an increased risk for CRC metastasis, providing compelling data that this gene may be useful both as a prognostic marker and possibly as a chemopreventive or therapeutic target.","MACC1 is located on chromosome 7p21.1 and regulates injury response and tissue growth via the HGF/MET signaling pathway. Of note, HGF and MET also map to chromosome 7 (7q21.1 and 7q31, respectively). Polysomy of chromosome 7 is a common finding in both glioblastomas and CRC tumors [3], and recent genome-wide analysis of siblings with familial CRC not related to known genetic conditions implicated 7q31 as a region linked to hereditary CRC [4].HGF regulates growth of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and interacts with interleukin 7 to regulate the immune response to mucosal lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa [5], mainly via activity in the stroma. The malaria parasite Plasmodium sporozoite stimulates stromal cell secretion of HGF, which activates its receptor MET. Activation of HGF/MET in turn disrupts the host-cell cytoskeleton, making the hepatocytes vulnerable to infection with this parasite [6]. HGF prompts tumor invasiveness via tumorstromal cell interactions. Increased stromal expression of HGF is associated with many cancer types, including endo-metrial and breast cancer [7, 8].MET is a proto-oncogene considered essential for metastatic potential in CRC [9–12]. MET was first recognized as an oncogene in osteosarcoma cell lines [13], and later Schmidt et al. [14] detected missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET both in the germline of individuals with hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and in somatic DNA from sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. MET is expressed mainly on the surface of epithelial cancer cells. Missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET also have been detected in childhood hepatocellular carcinomas [15]. MET encodes the tyrosine kinase that serves as a cell surface receptor for HGF/scatter factor (HGF/SF), which is one member of a family of soluble proteins known as scatter factors that regulate invasive growth [16, 17].","Aberrant activation of MET deregulates the HGF/MET signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis [18]. MET has multiple docking sites, including a transducer docking site that intensifies both the transforming and metastatic abilities of this oncogene. HGF binding to MET leads to phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus, which, once phosphorylated, can recruit the adapter proteins Gab1, Grb2, and Shc and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) [19]. MET then activates downstream signaling of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or PI3K-Akt pathways to promote the invasive growth characteristic of malignancies and their metastatic properties. However, MET can be activated independently of HGF binding through amplification and/or mutation. A single point mutation in the transducer docking site results in inhibition of the metastasis function of this signaling cascade, while preserving its oncogenic transformation capacity [20].MACC1 enters this complicated series of signaling upstream of MET. MET has been proven by Stein et al. [2] to be a transcriptional target of MACC1. SW 480 colon cancer cell line transfection and small interfering RNA studies suggest that the influence of MACC1 on the HGF/MET pathway is probably independent of MET. Transfection of MACC1 into cancer cell lines that normally do not express MACC1 led to increased HGF/MET expression. Small interfering RNA studies confirmed that MACC1 expression is independent of MET expression, while silencing of MET expression did not change MACC1 expression.","Inhibiting HGF/MET signaling is the focus of several therapeutic strategies for treating epithelial cancers [18]. Several phase I and II trials utilizing direct HGF inhibitors, and inhibitors of HGF binding to MET, as well as MET antibodies or small-molecule MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently under way. The antagonist NK4, which is composed of an internal fragment of HGF that competitively binds the HGF receptor of MET without activating MET and its downstream signaling, has successfully stopped angiogenesis and tumor growth and metastases in patients with CRC or pancreatic cancer [21]. In the case of tumors with HGF-independent MET activation, NK4 is not effective. AMG102, a humanized anti-HGF antibody that directly inhibits HGF, is being tried on patients with renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme [22].Antibodies to the extracellular domain of MET have shown some success in preclinical models of several tumor types [23, 24]. Several MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being given to gastric cancer patients with tumors harboring MET amplification. The sensitivity of other cancer-related tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies according to the specific receptor mutations, resulting in mutation-specific binding affinities; thus, the development of MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been designed to have high-affinity binding dependent on the variant, in order to decrease resistance to these agents [25]. Combination therapies with other signal transduction inhibitors have been tried to increase therapeutic effectiveness. Because enhanced transforming growth factor-α (EGFR) and MET pathways can activate one another, combination therapy with inhibitors to EGFR and MET are under evaluation in cancer cell lines [26]. Combination therapy with MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and standard chemotherapeutic agents and the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is another treatment modality that targets the HGF/MET pathway."
6,Analysis of factors influencing the results of colorectal cancer surgery in the elderly,"Since over 70% of colorectal cancers (CRC) occurs in patients at least aged 65 years old, it can be considered a disease of elderly people and is one of major cause of morbidity and mortality at this age [1][2][3]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of surgical treatment in older population referred to our institution and the effectiveness in terms of surgical and oncologic results with emphasis to age-related risk factors.","A retrospective analysis of a geriatric population (>70 y.o.) affected by CRC was carried out to review risks and benefits of surgery. In our series of 120 patients treated during the period 2008–2012 69 patients (57,5%) were at least 70 year old (median age 74 years) and 12 of these (17,4%) patients were octogenarians. 37 were male and 32 female. The following parameters have been evaluated: presence of co-morbidities, adoption of neoadjuvant therapies, pathology, surgical treatment and we tried to understand their feasible role to determine results in terms of morbidity, mortality, disease free survival and 2yr-survival 4.","Co-morbidities age-related, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiopulmonary disease, and chronic renal disease, were present in 52 (75%) patients. Combined neoadjuvant therapies based on radio-chemotherapy protocols (RT-CHT) were carried successfully out in 5 patients with mid and low rectal cancer. Our surgical choices are synthesized in table 1.Table 1 CRC in elderly patients: our surgical choices according to the site of tumorsFull size tableSurgery was performed in emergency in 2/69 (2,3%) cases. A simple stoma was done in 2 cases. In 7 patients synchronous hepatic metastasis were diagnosed and 3 cases presented a peritoneal carcinosis.The majority of tumors presented type I cell grading (G1). Tumor markers were not significant in 47 cases (66%). Tumors resulted at the following TNM’s stages: T1N0M0 3%, T2N0M0 3,5%, T3N0M0 25%, T2N1M0 7%, T3/4N1/2M0 47% and TNNNM1 14,5%.In elderly people post- operative complications occurred in 20 cases (29%) and 13% concerned medical complications. Perioperative mortality rate was 0,5%. Mean hospitalization was 15 days (range 12-18 days). After 24 months the overall survival was 81.4% for patients >70 years and the disease-free survival was 73,9%.","Recent studies showed that elderly patients do not have to receive sub-optimal surgical and medical treatments because of unacceptable prejudices. The relationship between age and outcomes is complex and depends on differences in tumor-stage and pre-existing co-morbidities [5]. Chronological age alone does not provide sufficient guidance for surgical effectiveness. Key parameters in the surgical risk assessment are represented by biological indexes of each patient. The major complications were analyzed in according to ASA score that, strongly depending on clinical functional status, was a valid preoperative parameter able to predict the surgical morbidity. The oncologic results and the morbidity rates of our experience confirm that surgery is a safe therapy also in elderly patients when operative risk and associated diseases evaluation has been carefully calculated. Our morbidity and mortality rates are acceptable. Our results do not differ from those reported in literature for younger patients and from other series concerning elderly population. In term of prognosis the analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival at 24 months showed a better trend in a geriatric cohort of patients with age >70 years. The role of surgery in colorectal cancer geriatric patients is well defined in the scientific literature. More comprehensive insights in oncologic surgery of elderly population will derive from the better understanding of the physiology of aging and combined therapies."
