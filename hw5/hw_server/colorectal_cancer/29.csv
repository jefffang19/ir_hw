0,Palliative radiotherapy in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer,"Local recurrence of colorectal cancer after surgery occurred in 10-40% of patients [1–4]. Although local control has been improved with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), approximately 10-25% of patients still develop recurrence of disease in the pelvis [5–7]. Pelvic recurrence contributes significantly to the clinical course and is one of the major problems affecting the quality of life in these patients [8, 9].The role of primary tumor resection for non-curable stage IV colorectal cancer remains undefined. Kleespies et al. reported that palliative resection was associated with a particularly unfavorable outcome in rectal cancer patients presenting with locally advanced lesion expected macroscopic residual tumor or an extensive comorbidity [10]. Patients with prior curative resection of colorectal cancer often present with pelvic pain, one of the common manifestations of local recurrence involving nerves in the presacrum or pelvic sidewalls. The surgical approach to relieve symptomatic pain in the pelvis is usually unlikely to have negative resection margins [11]. Accordingly, resection of symptomatic pelvic tumor may be warranted only in those with adequate performance status and a resectable tumor burden with a possibly negative resection margin.RT has been considered an effective palliative treatment for patients with symptomatic pelvic tumors of colorectal cancer. Previous studies have used RT as palliative treatment to relieve pelvic symptoms in heterogeneous patients [9, 11–23]. These studies included patients with unresectable local recurrence after definitive surgery and symptomatic local recurrence with distant metastasis. Recently, modern combination chemotherapy including targeted drugs has been used to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer patients [24, 25]. Although these drugs might be effective for symptomatic palliation in responding patients, the role of RT in addition to chemotherapeutic or targeted drugs for palliation is controversial. To date, there have been few reports of the synergistic effect of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with palliative intent in gastrointestinal cancer [22, 26–30].In this study, we evaluated the palliative role of RT and defined the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with palliative RT in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer.","From August 1995 to December 2007, we retrospectively reviewed 80 patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with palliative RT at Samsung Medical Center. All patients had disease outside the pelvis and consulted a radiation oncologist for symptomatic palliation.Fifty-eight patients (73%) were initially diagnosed with rectal cancer and 22 patients (27%) with colon cancer. Seventy-two patients (90%) were treated with surgery, including 64 complete local excisions (52 curative surgeries). Eight patients (10%) received chemotherapy alone. Twenty-two patients (27%) received adjuvant RT after curative surgery or salvage RT after local recurrence. The RT dose ranged from 40Gy to 74Gy with 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction.Patient age at the time of palliative RT for symptomatic pelvic mass ranged from 27 to 85 years (median 57 years). There were 43 males (54%) and 37 females (46%). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scores were 0 in one patient (1%), 1 in 28 (35%), 2 in 36 (45%), 3 in 13 (16%), and 4 in two (3%) patients. Forty patients (50%) had single organ metastasis regardless of the number of metastatic nodules, and 40 patients (50%) had two or more organ metastases. The common metastatic sites were liver (33 patients, 41%), lung (29, 36%), paraaortic lymph node (27, 34%), and peritoneal seeding (15, 19%).Eighty patients had 95 cases of clinical symptoms. The most common clinical symptom was pain (68, 72%), followed by rectal bleeding in 18 cases (19%), and obstructive symptoms in nine cases (9%). Six patients had two concurrent symptoms, pain and bleeding (five patients) or pain and obstruction (one patient). Seven patients experienced pain recurrence after palliative RT and received palliative re-RT. In these patients, evaluation of the response to palliative re-RT was available, and all cases were independently included in the analysis of symptom response to palliative RT.RT was administered using 6-15 MV photon beams from linear accelerators. The radiation field included the recurrent mass of the pelvic cavity with 2-3 cm margins. Different RT doses were used according to the patient's performance status and extra-pelvic tumor burden. The median RT dose was 36 Gy (8-60 Gy). All patients received RT once daily, and the dose per fraction ranged from 1.8 Gy to 8.0 Gy (median 2.5 Gy). The total RT doses were converted into the biologically equivalent dose (BED) for comparison. When α/β was assumed to be 10 Gy, the median total BED was 46.8 Gy10 (14.4-78.0 Gy10).Twenty-one patients (26%) received CCRT with the following regimens: capecitabine in eight patients, fluorouracil in six patients, oral tegafur-uracil in five patients, and combination regimen in two patients. Thirty-one cases received further chemotherapy after completion of palliative RT. Patient and treatment characteristics are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Patient and treatment characteristicsFull size tableSymptom palliation was assessed one month after the completion of palliative RT. For patients with pain as the presenting symptom, effective palliation was defined as decreased or resolved pain or decreased analgesia. For patients with bleeding, effective palliation was defined as improved hemoglobin, stable hemoglobin, resolved hematochesia, or normalized hemoglobin. For patients with obstruction, effective palliation was defined as improved or resolved constipation, decreased laxative use, or no need for intervention such as a stent or colostomy.The follow-up period was defined as the time from the start of palliative RT until progression of symptom or death. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.Survival rates were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons between the groups were determined using the log-rank test [31]. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the relationships between the outcomes and possible prognostic variables using the Cox proportional hazards model [32]. The Chi-square test was used to analysis differences in patient and treatment characteristics between the symptom control group and the recurrent group. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS for Windows, version 9.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).","The median follow-up time was five months (range, 1-44 months). The overall survival rate at one year was 22.1%, and the median survival was six months. Overall symptomatic palliation was achieved in 76 of 95 cases (80%). Forty-three cases (45%) experienced recurrence of symptoms, and the median symptom control duration was five months (range, 1-44 months).In 80 patients, 68 cases had the symptom of pain; 54 cases (79%) achieved palliation of pain and 35 cases (51%) experienced reappearance of pain. Eighteen cases had the symptom of bleeding; 15 cases (83%) achieved palliation of bleeding and five cases (28%) experienced reappearance of bleeding. Nine cases had the symptom of obstruction; seven cases (78%) achieved palliation of obstruction, and three cases (33%) experienced reappearance of obstruction.Figure 1 shows symptom control rates according to initial presenting symptom. One-year symptomatic control rates were 32.1%, 69.9%, and 37.5% for pain, bleeding, and obstruction, respectively. Table 2 shows the recurrence rate after symptom palliation. BED was a statistically significant factor affecting recurrence after symptom palliation (p = 0.0011). For BED < 40 Gy10, 23 of 34 cases (68%) had recurrence and for BED ≥ 40 Gy10, and 20 of 61 cases (33%) had recurrence.Figure 1Symptom control rates according to initial presenting symptom. (a) pain, (b) bleeding, (c) obstruction.Full size imageTable 2 Symptom recurrences according to patient and treatment characteristics in patients with palliative symptom control after palliative treatment.Full size tableOn univariate analysis, the only significant prognostic factor for symptom control rate was BED (p = 0.0089), and CCRT was a marginally significant factor (p = 0.0644) (Table 3). In patients with pain, higher BED and CCRT was associated with improved outcome with statistical significance. In patients with bleeding, only higher BED was statistically significant factor. In nine patients with obstruction, there was no significant factor associated with symptom relief. Figure 2 shows differences in the symptom control rate according to BED and CCRT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of prognostic factors for the symptom control rate revealed that higher RT dose (BED ≥ 40 Gy10, hazard ratio; 0.503, p = 0.0406) and CCRT (hazard ratio; 0.427, p = 0.0449) were favorable factors.Table 3 Univariate analysis of factors affecting symptom control rate in 95 casesFull size tableFigure 2Symptom control rates according to the biologically equivalent dose (BED) and concurrent chemotherapy during RT (CCRT). (a) BED more than 40 Gy10 was a statistically significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0089) on univariate analysis in all cases. CCRT was a marginally significant factor (p = 0.0644) on univariate analysis in all cases. (b) In patients with pain, higher BED and CCRT was associated with improved outcome with statistical significance. (c) In patients with bleeding, only higher BED was statistically significant factor.Full size imageAll patients tolerated the palliative treatment. Thirty-eight patients experienced nausea, diarrhea, cystitis, or perineal skin reaction of grade 1 or 2 during treatment. There was no significant difference of treatment related toxicity between RT alone and CCRT (45% vs. 52%, p = 0.4380). There was no severe toxicity above grade 3 or treatment-related deaths.","External RT has been considered an effective palliative treatment in patients with an unresectable pelvic mass of colorectal cancer. Studies reported in the 1960s-1980s showed that relief of pain and/or bleeding was achieved in approximately 75% of patients with doses as low as 20 Gy in ten fractions over two weeks or various doses of 40-60Gy in 1.8-2.5 Gy per fraction [11–20]. Median duration of symptom relief was only 6-9 months. Later reports showed similar or improved results of symptom palliation: control of pain in 78-93% of patients, control of bleeding in 68-100%, and control of mass in 35-88% [9, 21–23]. The rate and duration of symptom palliation in our study were similar to those of previous reports.Some data suggest a correlation between RT dose and the effect of palliation. Wong CS et al. [9] reported the response rate of pelvic symptoms according to RT dose. There was a trend suggesting increased response rates with increasing total RT dose. For pain improvement after RT, 48% of patients responded after a total dose of less than 20 Gy, 77% responded after a dose of 20-30 Gy, 79% after 30-45 Gy, and 89% after 45 Gy or more. For residual, inoperable, or recurrent lesions, Wang CC and Schulz MD [17] reported that the percentage of patients with controlled symptoms for six months or more increased with dose (12% with 21-30 Gy, 31% with 31-40 Gy, and 58% with 41-50 Gy). Crane CH et al. [22] used hypofractionated RT with three different dose regimens (30 Gy/6 fractions, 35 Gy/14 fractions and 45 Gy/25 fractions). On univariate analysis, BED < 35 Gy10 showed a higher risk of pelvic symptomatic progression when α/β was assumed to be 10 Gy(p = 0.009). In our study, the overall symptom control rate and the one-year symptom control rate were 69% and 40.5% respectively for BED ≥ 40 Gy10 and 32% and 28.5% for BED < 40 Gy10. Since BED was a significant prognostic factor for symptom control rate, it might be better to treat with a higher RT dose to increase the palliation rate and symptom control duration.In the pelvic cavity, the tolerance dose of normal tissue is a limiting factor when determining the RT dose. The small bowel, which is regarded as one of the most sensitive organs to RT, has a tolerance dose of TD 5/5 with a dose of 50 Gy for 1/3 small bowel irradiation and TD 50/5 with a dose of 60 Gy [33]. The risk of injury to the bowel is increased in cases with a history of previous surgery. However, there is evidence suggesting that significant recovery of the RT effect occurs with time [23, 34]. Nieder C et al. [34] reported that acute responding tissues recovered from radiation injury within a few months and could then tolerate another full course of radiation. For late toxicity endpoints, the skin, mucosa, lung, and spinal cord do partially recover from subclinical injury at a magnitude dependent on the organ type, size of the initial dose, and, to a lesser extent, the interval between radiation courses. Mohiuddin M et al. [23] reported long term results of re-RT for patients with recurrent rectal cancer. They suggested a re-RT dose according to the interval between previous RT and re-RT as follows: 35 Gy for an interval of 3-12 months, 40-45 Gy for 12-24 months, 45-50 Gy for 24-36 months, and 50-55 Gy for more than 36 months. In our study, 27% of patients received re-RT, and there was no severe toxicity, including RT-induced fistula.There are a few studies on CCRT for palliative intent in patients with distant metastasis. Wong CS et al. [9] reviewed 519 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer treated with RT. Concurrent extrapelvic distant metastases were found in 164 patients. Twenty-two patients received CCRT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in a pilot study of combined modality therapy. Ten of the 22 patients were unable to complete the treatment protocol because of excessive acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity, and five patients developed neutropenic sepsis, one of whom died [35]. Crane CH et al. [22] first described the use of CCRT as an initial measure in 80 patients with synchronous distant metastasis from rectal cancer. Symptoms from the primary tumor resolved in 94% of cases, and progression occurred at a median of 33 weeks. There were acute complications of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Grade 3 or greater in four patients, severe perioperative complications in five patients, and no significant late treatment-related complications. They concluded that initial pelvic CCRT produced high pelvic symptom control rates and that patients can be safely treated using this modality. In a study of the clinical benefit of palliative CCRT in advanced gastric cancer, 37 patients were treated with palliative RT (median dose 35 Gy) and nearly two-thirds of all patients received CCRT [26]. The overall symptom control rate was approximately 70%, which was superior to the previous 25-54% control rate for palliative RT alone [36]. Some studies reported the benefit of palliative CCRT for dysphagia in advanced esophageal cancer [27–30]. A phase I/II trial from Canada [29] prospectively treated 22 patients with dysphagia from advanced incurable esophageal cancer with palliative RT (30 Gy/10 Fractions) and a concurrent single course of chemotherapy (5-FU and mitomycin-C). Treatment was generally well tolerated and 68% achieved a complete response. The median dysphagia-free interval from time of onset of improvement was 11 weeks, and 11 patients (73%) remained dysphagia-free until death. They concluded that a short course of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy might produce complete relief of swallowing difficulties in a substantial proportion of patients with acceptable toxicity. In our study, the overall symptom control rate and one-year symptom control rate were 64% and 61.3%, respectively, in CCRT and 52% and 33.2% in RT alone. There were no severe complications in the CCRT group.Our study has some limitations. First, this study was retrospectively analysis. It had heterogeneous patient's group and radiation dose. The results may be affected by the selection biases. Second, this study was performed in a small sample size. To conclude the effectiveness of the higher BED≥ 40 Gy10 and CCRT to symptomatic pelvic recurrence, prospective randomized trial might be needed."
1,Incidence and risk factors of portomesenteric venous thrombosis after colorectal surgery for cancer in the elderly population,"Portomesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening, condition. Data about PMVT in broader surgical population are scarce. Incidence and risk factors for PMVT development after major abdominal surgery, in particular colon and rectal procedures, have been recently studied [1, 2]. The incidence of postoperative PMVT has been reported to range from 2.8 to 9%. Although it is known that splanchnic venous thrombosis is associated with total colectomy and proctocolectomy in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease [3,4,5], little is known about incidence and risk factors of PMVT among the elderly population undergoing colorectal surgery for cancer. The incidence of postoperative PMVT after colorectal surgery has been reported to range from 2.8 to 9%. Factors reported to be associated with the development of PMVT include manipulation of mesenteric vessels, postoperative septic complications, and various underlying diseases.The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of PMVT after colorectal surgery in the elderly as well as the presence of risk factors, presenting symptoms, and the treatment.","Data of patients collected during a 12-year period (from September 2002 to July 2014) with diagnosis of colorectal cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were patients > 70 years who underwent surgical intervention and needed CT scan for the new onset of abdominal pain. CT scans were performed using a spiral CT scanner with intravenously administered contrast.Our perioperative prophylaxis routinely included subcutaneous heparin administration and perioperative handling of antiplatelet drugs according to the current literature [6,7,8,9]. A complete coagulation profile was performed whenever a diagnosis of portomesenteric venous thrombosis was made. The coagulation profile included platelet count, thrombin time, antithrombin III, plasminogen, protein C, protein S, homocysteine level, factor V Leiden mutation, and prothrombin G20210A mutation,Data collected included age, sex, obesity, ASA score, tumoral stage, type of surgical resection, surgical approach (laparoscopic or open), and duration of surgery (from skin incision to the application of dressings).The occurrence of portomesenteric venous thrombosis was correlated with the patients’ characteristics and operative variables.Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0. The Yates corrected χ2 test was used to evaluate differences in categorical variables, and the independent samples t test was used to analyze continuous variables. To adjust for covariates and to make predictions, logistic regression model was used. Statistical significance was accepted when the p value was less than 0.05.","A total of 137 patients > 70 years who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer with a postoperative onset of symptoms suggestive of an acute intraabdominal process, who therefore needed a CT scan were identified.Three of these patients (2.1%) had portomesenteric venous thrombosis during the study period, which was proved with CT scan. In all three cases, splanchnic venous thrombosis could be identified by CT scan. In most cases, the main symptom was the new-onset of acute abdominal pain. Other signs and symptoms included fever in two patients, of which one presented an elevated white blood cell count, and nausea in one patient. The intercurrent time between surgery and the acute event was respectively 35, 62, and 80 days.Patients’ characteristics and operative variables of entire study population and of the patients with PMVT are respectively shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1 Patients characteristics and operative variables of the 137 patients with abdominal painFull size table
Table 2 Patients with PMVTFull size tableConsidering thrombosis risk factors, none of the three patients with PMVT had any alteration of coagulation profile.All three patients recovered from the acute event, with no need for further surgical intervention. They have been discharged from the hospital with long-term systemic oral anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 months. In details, to all subjects were given intravenous fluids, prophylactic antibiotic therapy (3rd generation cephalosporin–ceftriaxone- 1 g e.v. twice daily) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy (100 UI/Kg s.c. twice/day). A week later, 2 patients were given warfarin with a target PT INR value ≥ 2. The other patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy prior to starting warfarin with a target PT INR value ≥ 2. In both cases, LMWH was stopped when PT INR reached values of INR ≥ 2 [10]. All the three cases of PMVT were successfully resolved.After a median follow-up of 24 months, all three patients had discontinued taking their oral anticoagulants but no cases of recurrent thrombotic events have been reported. During the follow-up period, no death was reported.There were no significant patients’ characteristics or operative variables between patients with or without the occurrence of PMVT after surgery. Of interest, only operative time was significantly higher in the group of patients with PMVT after surgery (256 ± 40 vs 140 ± 41, p < 0,001). After adjusting for patients’ characteristics and operative variables in a multivariate logistic regression, operative time showed a clear trend toward a higher PMVT occurrence (OR = 4.7 95% CI).","Life-threatening complications caused by thrombosis of portomesenteric venous system have been recognized and treated since the end of nineteenth century [11,12,13].Portomesenteric venous thrombosis is known to be a rare condition that occurs in association with many other precipitating factors, capable of producing a wide range of clinical problems. Among the most common causes, there are hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, pyophlebitis from bowel disease, and spontaneous thrombosis from hypercoagulable state [14,15,16,17].In this study, no patients had risk factors for thrombosis. In addition, there are no laboratory-chemical parameters specifically designed to confirm PMVT.However, it is important to underline that the analysis of hematic parameters of thrombosis represents only a superficial examination, and it is not possible to rule out severe coagulation disorders with just this test.At the moment, many medical centers perform CT scan as the primary imaging modality in patients with acute abdominal pain. CT scan is remarkably useful to identify bowel perforation or obstruction, as well as venous thrombosis or arterial ischemia [18,19,20,21].PMVT development after colorectal surgery has been recently studied. This surgical population can include many of the proposed PMVT risk factors.Several conditions can be cause of PMVT after colorectal surgery: the type of procedure, intraoperative manipulation of mesenteric vessels, intraabdominal pressure created by a pneumoperitoneum, intraabdominal septic complications, inherited or acquired prothrombotic conditions [2].In fact, patients suffering from IBDs and cancer have a higher risk for venous thrombotic events, and this risk is further increased by septic complications and surgery [15, 17].As far as we know, this is the first multicentric institution series evaluating the incidence and risk factors of symptomatic PMVT in elderly patients, undergoing elective colorectal surgery for cancer, with both open and laparoscopic technique.It is well known that less invasive approach reached in the last decades increased popularity in each surgical field and it is considered the best surgical approach to colorectal and gastric malignancy [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]: shorter recovery and hospitalization, lower postoperative pain, and a better cosmetic results comparing with the open surgery are the main advantages of this technique, even in the elderly population [33, 34].On the other side, data about PMWT after laparoscopic procedures are scarce.Up to now, only Allaix et al. [2] retrospectively analyzed 1069 consecutive laparoscopic colorectal resections for inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. 3.5% patients experienced symptomatic postoperative PMVT. Robinson et al. [1] retrospectively reviewed 1224 patients who underwent colorectal surgery for carcinoma, IBD, or diverticulitis. Three percent of them were diagnosed with PMVT. Remzi et al. [35] retrospectively reviewed 702 patients undergoing total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis by an open approach. Symptomatic PMVT was observed in 6% of cases. Also Fichera et al. [3] published similar results in a retrospective analysis of 83 consecutive patients undergoing open total colectomy for IBD. They found a symptomatic PMVT in about 5% of the patients studied. Finally, Antiel RM et al. [4] reviewed 366 pediatric patients who underwent colectomy for ulcerative colitis. Four percent were diagnosed with PMVT.Thus, it is known that splanchnic venous thrombosis is associated with total colectomy and proctocolectomy in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease.However, little is known about the incidence of PMVT after colorectal surgery in the elderly population. Mean age among current literature varies from 17.9 to 62 years [2, 4].Speaking of incidence of PMVT, our observation confirms the findings of the other studies published in the literature; moreover, it extended these results to the elderly population.We found symptomatic PMVT in 2.1% of the elderly (> 70 years) population (mean age of 75.5 ± 7.1 years) after surgery. No death occurred during the 24-month follow-up period. Thus PMVT is not an uncommon cause of abdominal pain after colorectal surgery for cancer in the elderly population.Risk factors for PMVT identified with univariate and multivariate analysis include only operative time. Of interest, laparoscopic colorectal resections were not associated with a higher risk of portomesenteric venous thrombosis occurrence.Some limitations of this study have to be addressed. First of all, the study design, which is retrospective; another limitation is the small sample size, which could not be a guarantee of correlation between PMVT and surgical procedure; finally, the long period between discharge and PMVT that makes difficult the correlation between the intervention and the adverse event, although this is probably suggested by the lack of other risk factors."
2,Elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio associated with concurrent administration of regorafenib and warfarin in a patient with advanced colorectal cancer,"Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor, which has shown antitumor activity in patients with advanced colorectal cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumors who have previously received standard treatment and discontinued it owing to disease progression or side effects [1, 2]. Regorafenib is mainly metabolized to M-2 and M-5 by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, both of which have pharmacological activity similar to that of regorafenib [3]. In addition, results from in vitro analysis showed that regorafenib and its metabolites might inhibit the activity of several CYPs such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms [3].The plasma concentration of warfarin, the substrate for CYP2C9, could be increased with the concurrent use of regorafenib, which leads to enhance warfarin’s anticoagulant effects. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of warfarin increases with concurrent administration of regorafenib [3]. However, there are no reports indicating that regorafenib interacts with warfarin and leads to increased anticoagulant effects. Here, we report the case of a patient with advanced colon cancer, who experienced elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) with concurrent use of regorafenib and warfarin.","A 76-year-old man with stage IV colon cancer metastasis underwent resection of part of the colon and cholecystectomy. He had a history of hypothyroidism and acute myocardial infarction. He did not drink alcohol but had a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years. He had taken medicines, including levothyroxine (75 μg daily), spironolactone (25 mg daily), nicorandil (10 mg daily), pravastatin (5 mg daily), allopurinol (200 mg daily), and warfarin (2 mg daily). After surgery, treatment was started with modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX6, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin, 400 mg/m2 5-FU bolus on day 1 and 2400 mg/m2 5-FU over 46 h every 2 weeks) in July 2012 to liver metastasis. His PT/INR value was controlled around 2.0 before receiving mFOLFOX6 and did not increase when this treatment was given. He was received mFOLFOX6 for 6 months, but his carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level increased, and computed tomography (CT) showed progression of liver metastasis. Then, treatment with irinotecan (CPT-11) plus S-1 was initiated (CPT-11 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks). His PT/INR value slightly increased to 2.98 from 2.31 2 weeks after CPT-11 plus S-1 was administered. Then the dose of warfarin was reduced to 1 mg and PT/INR value decreased to around 2.0. However, after 3 cycles of treatment with CPT-11 plus S-1, he developed interstitial pneumonia and discontinued this therapy, leading to decreased PT/INR value around 1.3. Furthermore, the interstitial pneumonia improved but a CT scan indicated that his hepatic metastasis had progressed. Then, he began a course of treatment with regorafenib at a dosage of 120 mg daily on days 1 to 21 every 4 weeks in October 2013. The warfarin dose was increased up to 1.5 mg one month before initiation of treatment with regorafenib and up to 2 mg again when regorafenib was given concurrently (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) values and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels during regorafenib treatment. Only an important points are mentioned PT/INR values (day on course) after co-administration of regorafenibFull size image
Although the patient’s PT/INR value was 1.26 before initiation of treatment with regorafenib, this value significantly increased to 2.1 on day 8, 2.98 on day 15, and 6.4 on day 22 (Fig. 1). Regorafenib and warfarin treatments were discontinued, and his PT/INR value decreased to 1.31 within 1 week after the discontinuation. Then, warfarin was reduced by 0.5 mg daily and was restarted. As he had developed grade 2 hand-foot syndrome during the first cycle of treatment, regorafenib was also reduced by 80 mg daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks at a physician's discretion and was restarted.The warfarin dose was increased up to 1 mg daily after 2 weeks and up to 1.5 mg daily after 2 months, respectively. Although his PT/INR value increased gradually with an increasing dose of warfarin, further elevation was not seen with the concomitant use of regorafenib. Additionally, laboratory findings showed that liver functions including alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase serum levels were normal, although the liver metastasis showed slight progression on a CT scan (data not shown).In March 2014, regorafenib and warfarin treatment were discontinued again because the patient developed a pneumothorax. One month later, the pneumothorax healed and the patient was restarted on a course of warfarin (1.5 mg daily) prior to regorafenib. Two weeks later, regorafenib treatment was also restarted at the same treatment schedule and dose, at which time his PT/INR value was 2.04. His PT/INR value increased to 3.37 again on day 8 after restarting treatment with regorafenib (Fig. 1). He was then discharged with the treatment of 1 mg warfarin daily. The PT/INR value reduced to 2.37 one week after the reduction of warfarin treatment. Then, the PT/INR value did not increase during the concomitant use of regorafenib. However, his CEA level increased, and his hepatic metastasis showed progression on a CT scan. Then, treatment with regorafenib was discontinued and the patient was treated with trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (Lonsurf®). PT/INR value did not increase when the salvage treatment with Lonsurf® was given (data not shown).This case report was approved by the ethics review committee of the Houju Memorial Hospital (Ishikawa, Japan) (No. 16–5).","This is the first report of a patient with advanced colon cancer who had a significant increase in the PT/INR when administered warfarin concomitantly with regorafenib. Although the warfarin dose was increased up to 2 mg when regorafenib was administered simultaneously, the patient did not demonstrate a marked increase in PT/INR with a daily 2 mg dose of warfarin before receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, we suggest that this event was not caused only by an increase in the dose of warfarin.There is a possibility that impaired hepatic function due to tumor progression results in the elevation of PT/INR, but no deterioration of liver function was observed, while hepatic metastasis had slightly progressed during the regorafenib treatment. In addition, it is suggested that regorafenib itself may increase the PT/INR value directly via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, which is related to the induction of angiogenesis. Indeed, a previous report showed that INR value increased in 120 out of 500 patients (24 %) who were treated with regorafenib [3]. However, in this case, the PT/INR value did not increase when a low dose of warfarin (0.5–1 mg daily) was administered, whereas its value increased at the warfarin dose was increased up to 1.5–2 mg, while the dose of regorafenib was same (Fig. 1). Therefore, we speculate that PT/INR increase in this case was not caused by direct action of regorafenib but by drug interaction between regorafenib and warfarin.We assessed this event using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, which indicated a probable relationship (score of 6) between regorafenib use and the elevated PT/INR value [4]. The Naranjo scale was designed to evaluate single drug adverse events, not drug interactions. We also assessed the causation of this adverse reaction using the drug interaction probability scale score for potential drug interactions in the patient, which indicated a probable likelihood of an interaction (score of 7) [5].Warfarin is highly bound (99 %) to human plasma proteins [6]. In vitro protein binding of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 to human plasma proteins is also high at 99.5, 99.8, and 99.95 %, respectively [3]. There were no change in serum albumin level during concomitant use of regorafenib and warfarin in our case (data not shown). Although we could not measure the plasma free levels of warfarin or regorafenib and its metabolite, it is possible that the concentration of plasma-free warfarin will be elevated and lead to increased anticoagulant effects via competition for protein binding sites when these two drugs are used concurrently. However, it is unknown that which metabolite is most contribute to the displacement warfarin from plasma proteins.Warfarin is metabolized via several CYPs, including CYP3A4, with involvement of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18 and CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 [7–10]. S-warfarin, which exhibits potent anticoagulant activity, is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 [7]. Regorafenib and its metabolite M-2 inhibit CYP2C9 [3]. IC50 values for CYP2C9 inhibition by regorafenib and M-2 are 2.7 and 6.1 μM, respectively [11]. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analysis from a phase I study also revealed that after oral administration of 160 mg or 120 mg regorafenib for 3 weeks, the plasma Cmax value in its steady state of regorafenib is slightly higher than that of M-2 [12, 13]. In this case, the patient was not administered regorafenib concomitantly with a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4, which is the main enzyme involved in metabolism of regorafenib. Therefore, although we could not measure plasma Cmax values of regorafenib and M-2 at the steady state, we speculate that the steady state Cmax value of regorafenib in this case could also be larger than that of M-2. Therefore, we speculate that regorafenib may have more potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C9 than M-2, considering IC50 and steady state Cmax values of them.In this case, a significant elevation of PT/INR occurred 3 weeks after regorafenib co-administration. Goto et al. reported that hematuria and a marked increase in PT/INR occurred after administering warfarin for about 1 month [14]. In this report, PT/INR increased due to CYP2C9 variants because the patient had the CYP2C9*3/*3 allele. Indeed, CYP2C9 genotypes are closely associated with warfarin dose adjustment [15]. Of the more than 30 identified CYP2C9 variants, the CYP2C9*3 allele is associated with reduced enzyme activity and requires lower maintenance doses of warfarin [16]. Obayashi et al. reported that the mean daily dose of warfarin was lower in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 (1.86 ± 0.80 mg daily) than in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 (3.36 ± 1.43 mg daily) in a Japanese population [17]. A similar result was reported by Ohno et al. for differences in the mean maintenance dose of warfarin in Japanese patients with CYP2C9 variants [18]. Although we did not analyze the CYP2C9 variant in our case, the PT/INR value was controlled with 2 mg warfarin daily before receiving chemotherapy. Thus, we speculate that the patient might have the CYP2C9*3 allele, which might contribute to an increase in the PT/INR after the concomitant administration of regorafenib.Moreover, it has been reported that other oral multikinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, sorafenib, and vemurafenib, when used concurrently with warfarin, may also have the ability to increase circulating levels of warfarin and potentiating its anticoagulant effects [19–21]. Therefore, when treatment with such oral multikinase inhibitors is administered to patients who receive warfarin daily, switching from warfarin to other novel oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban and apixaban based on drug interaction should be considered.","The clinical course of this patient suggested that the PT/INR increases during the concurrent use of warfarin and regorafenib. Therefore, PT/INR should be periodically monitored during the concurrent use of warfarin and regorafenib."
3,Routine preoperative mechanical bowel preparation with additive oral antibiotics is associated with a reduced risk of anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing elective oncologic resection for colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common problem, and oncologic resection remains the only means of cure. Anastomotic leakage (AL) following resection of colon and rectal cancer represents the most feared complication [1, 2]. This single complication is a leading cause of significant morbidity and mortality following radical surgery for CRC. Anastomotic leakage might be associated with dalliance or omission of chemotherapy [3]. More so, AL has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of local cancer recurrence [4]. These factors have been shown to be associated with reduced overall survival [5, 6]. The effect of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) prior to colorectal resection on the risk of AL has been controversial in the past with constantly changing recommendations [7, 8]. Recently, many studies have identified a reduced risk of AL following preoperative MBP with additive oral antibiotics [9]. It is unclear whether the reduced risk of AL is primarily due to MBP or is secondary to oral antibiotics. This study was designed to study the effect of preoperative MBP with and without oral antibiotics on the rate of AL in patients undergoing oncologic colorectal resection with anastomosis for CRC.","This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Witten/Herdecke University. This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients undergoing oncologic resection of colorectal cancer. The data of all consecutive patients diagnosed with CRC is prospectively put into an institutional database by trained study nurses and research fellows as reported elsewhere [10, 11]. The database is continuously updated with data on the present status of all registered patients. All patients diagnosed with CRC are discussed in an interdisciplinary oncologic board prior to surgery. Oncologic colorectal surgery included central dissection of the mesenteric lymphovascular pathways in accordance with complete mesocolic excision (CME) in cases with colon cancer as described by Hohenberger et al. [12], partial mesorectal excision (PME) for proximal rectal cancer and cancer of the rectosigmoidal junction, and total mesorectal excision (TME) in cases with mid and low rectal cancer as described by Heald et al. [13]. Data of patients undergoing oncologic colorectal resection between January 2014 and September 2017 were included for analysis.MBP was performed in all cases prior to surgery. In the period prior to May 2016, preoperative MBP was performed using either polyethylenglykol or sodium–magnesium sulfate 24 h prior to surgery. Beginning June 2016, oral antibiotics (1 g vancomycin and 400 mg metronidazole) per liter PEG were added to the above preparation. Our study group included all cases managed after May 2016, i.e., patients who underwent MBP with additive oral antibiotics while all cases undergoing MBP without oral antibiotics were included in the control group. Perioperative single shot antibiotics was given to all patients.The extent of CRC was classified using both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging systems following histopathology in all cases [14]. Patient’s demographic information including sex and age at the time of diagnosis were recorded. Cancer specific parameters including the tumor stage (pT), nodal involvement (pN), the presence or absence of distance metastases (pM), and tumor location were noted. All patients undergoing oncologic resection were included for analysis. Exclusion criteria included: palliation procedures, patients with multiple cancers, patients undergoing emergency surgery, and cases without anastomosis.The main endpoint was the rate of AL. AL was suspected following clinical presentation and findings from physical examination. The diagnosis was confirmed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography, endoscopic examination, or during surgery. The extent of AL was characterized using the grading system proposed by Rahbari et al. [15]. According to this grading system, AL requiring no therapeutic intervention is classified as grade A and grade B leakages are managed via endoscopic, sonographic, or radiologic intervention, while grade C leakages warrant surgical revision.","The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. The study population was described using median and interquartile ranges where necessary. The chi square test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed for analytic statistics and odds ratio calculation. The two-sided p values were reported where necessary with the level of significance set as p < 0.05. A 95% confidence interval was used in all statistical analyses.","Four hundred and ninety-six patients underwent oncologic colorectal resection with anastomosis for CRC within the period of investigation. Colon cancer was managed in 370 cases while rectal cancer was managed in 126 cases. MBP with additive oral antibiotics (study group) was performed in 125 cases including 68 (54.4%) females and 57 (45.6%) males. MBP without oral antibiotics (control group) was done in 371 cases including 148 (39.9%) females and 223 (60.1%) males (Fig. 1). Significantly, more male patients were included in the group without oral antibiotics compared to the group with oral antibiotics: 60.1% vs. 45.6% respectively, p = 0.03. However, sex could not be identified as a risk factor for AL on multivariate analysis.Fig. 1Distribution of the study population. Patients undergoing MBP with oral antibiotics were included in the study group, while the control group included patients undergoing MBP without oral antibioticsFull size imageThe median age of the study group was 73.0 years (range 21–91 years) while the median age of the control group was 70.0 years (range 31–92 years). There was no statistically significant difference amongst both groups with regard to age (p = 0.413). The clinicopathologic findings in this study are presented in Table 1.Table 1 Baseline and clinical characteristics of the study population, AJCCFull size tableThere was no statistically significant difference amongst both groups with regard to the AJCC and UICC cancer stages. Equally, there was no statistically significant difference amongst both groups with regard to cancer location (Table 1).Forty-two cases of AL (8.5%), including three grade A, six grade B, and 33 grade C, were recorded in this series (Table 2). In 25 cases, AL occurred after colon resection (25/370 = 6.7%) and in 17 cases following rectal resection (17/126 = 13.5%). Five cases (5/125 = 4.0%) of AL were recorded in the study group, four cases (4/95 = 4.2%) after colon resection, and one case (1/30 = 3.3%) after rectal resection. On the other hand, the rate of AL was 10% (37/371) in the control group. This corresponded to 21 cases (21/232 = 9.1%) following colon resection and 16 cases (16/139 = 11.5%) following rectal resection. The rate of AL was significantly higher in the group without additive oral antibiotics (p = 0.038, Fig. 2). The risk of AL was more than twice higher in patients undergoing MBP without oral antibiotics was (OR 2.22, 0.96–5.12, p = 0.038).Table 2 Summary of AL in both groupsFull size tableFig. 2Rates of AL in both groups. A significantly higher rate of AL was recorded following MBP without oral antibiotics compared to the group with additive oral antibioticsFull size imageAmongst all patients undergoing rectal resection, preoperative radiation and chemotherapy were performed in 81 cases. In this group, MBP without oral antibiotics was performed in 71 cases while MBP with oral antibiotics was done in 10 cases. While no case of AL was recorded in patients undergoing MBP with oral antibiotics, six cases of AL were recorded in patients following MBP without oral antibiotics."
