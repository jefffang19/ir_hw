0,Colorectal cancer and self-reported tooth agenesis,"Teeth are formed from neural crest-derived mesenchyme and epithelium of the first branchial arch and part of the frontonasal process [1, 2]. The main proteins involved in development of dentition belong to one of five signaling pathways including Notch, bone morphogenetic protein, fibroblast growth factor, sonic hedgehog, and Wingless/integration (WNT).A Finnish family was described in 2004 [3] in which a nonsense mutation in axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2) was found to co-segregate with an oligodontia (severe tooth agenesis) phenotype. Further characterization of the family identified adenomatous colorectal polyps and cancer as part of the phenotype. A second family, also in Finland, with the same AXIN2 mutation was reported by Renkonen et al. [4] as part of their study of 29 polyposis families in which no adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation was found. The APC gene, mutations of which cause Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, is a key component of the WNT-signaling pathway. Like AXIN2, APC mutations can be associated with dental anomalies including missing or supernumerary teeth [5].The reported association between AXIN2 variants, colorectal cancer, and tooth agenesis suggests that these conditions may be associated. However, no large-scale studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have been conducted to assess a general association between colorectal neoplasia and missing teeth. The aim of this study was to determine if congenitally missing teeth may occur more commonly in individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer than in individuals without this diagnosis. If so, then questioning people about missing teeth might help identify those at increased risk for colorectal cancer. In this study, we surveyed participants of the Colon Cancer Family Registry (C-CFR) for self-reported missing permanent teeth and compared findings with unaffected relatives and controls. We also assayed for the presence of AXIN2 mutations in the only two probands presenting with colon cancer and tooth agenesis, and in family members with tooth agenesis but not cancer.","Participants in this study were recruited through the C-CFR, a National Institutes of Health-supported consortium established to provide resources for the interdisciplinary study of the etiology of colon cancer and identification of at-risk populations who may benefit from translational research and current therapeutic strategies. The consortium consists of six research centers: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; University of Hawaii Cancer Research Center, Honolulu, Hawaii; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; The University of Southern California Consortium, Los Angeles, California; Cancer Care Ontario, Ontario, Canada; and the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Detailed information about the C-CFR is described by Newcomb et al. [6]. This study included only CRC families from the Mayo Clinic and Toronto C-CFR sites, recruited both through the clinics and from population-based sources. After enrollment of the proband, recruitment invitation was extended to adult first- and second-degree relatives and in some families beyond that. Both Mayo Clinic and Cancer Care Ontario systematically oversampled for multiplex families and young-onset probands, but no information about dentition was known prior to enrollment. For C-CFR study participants with CRC, tumor characterization is routinely conducted to determine DNA mismatch repair status, and if abnormal, further testing is conducted for germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes [7]. Genetic testing for mutations in MUTYH is also standard for C-CFR probands [8]. Results of this molecular characterization were not used as inclusion or exclusion criteria for this study.Standardized protocols were used to collect family history, risk factor information, and biospecimens. For this study, two questions were added to the 5- or 10-year follow-up survey. The first asked if the participant had any permanent teeth that never formed, not counting wisdom teeth. If they answered yes, the second question asked how many teeth were missing. Cases were defined as probands and relatives who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Controls were defined as relatives and spouses who had never been diagnosed with any cancer. All study participants provided written informed consent and institutional review board approval was obtained at each center.Five of the CRC cases with a missing tooth reported one or more relatives with missing teeth (none of those relatives had CRC). On the two Mayo probands and their five relatives, we performed direct sequencing of all AXIN2 exons and exon-intron boundaries to look for mutations (DNA not available on the three multiplex Toronto families). Sequencing reactions were performed according to established protocols. Primer sequences and reaction conditions are available upon request.The frequency of missing teeth between cases and controls were compared using Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. The comparisons were also made stratified by the recruitment site (Cancer Care Ontario, Mayo Clinic), gender (male, female), and germline mutation status (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2n MUTYH). Note: the germline status of these genes was available in the C-CFR. These genes are not suspected of being involved with dental formation but were included in a stratified analysis just to be certain they were not contributing anything to the phenotype. Genetic testing for APC and AXIN2 were not conducted systematically in the C-CFR so were not part of this study design nor stratified analyses. However, sequencing of AXIN2 was conducted on two individuals who did have a colon cancer/missing teeth phenotype, and so this was reported, though it was not a primary aim of the study. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 12.1 [StataCorp. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP; 2011].","Of a total of 1809 cases (1596 probands and 213 relatives), we excluded 173 (148 probands and 25 relatives) who did not provide missing teeth information. Of a total of 3005 controls (2737 relatives and 268 spouses), we excluded 217 (207 relatives and 10 spouses) who did not provide missing teeth information. The remaining 1636 cases (1448 probands and 188 relatives) and 2788 controls (2530 relatives and 258 spouses) entered into the analysis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the cases versus the controls.Table 1

We observed that 4.8% of cases and 5.7% of controls reported having at least one missing tooth (Table 1), and there was no statistical evidence of difference between them (p = 0.20). When we stratified by recruitment site, gender, and mutation status where available, frequency of missing teeth was not statistically significantly different between cases and controls. Women were reported to have more missing teeth than men in both cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-3.93; p = 0.002) and controls (OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.09-2.27; p = 0.01; Table 2).Table 2

We looked to see if there were families in which multiple individuals reported missing teeth, and there were only a few. There were five CRC cases with a missing tooth reported in which one or more relatives had missing teeth (none of those relatives had CRC); eight of the CRC cases who themselves did not have missing teeth had two or more relatives with missing teeth; and of the CRC cases who did report one or more missing teeth, 24 had no other relatives surveyed in this study. All other probands had no reported missing teeth and 0-1 relatives with missing teeth.Direct sequencing of the two Mayo probands and their five relatives with hypodontia revealed the presence of a common P50S missense variant in exon 10 of the AXIN2 gene in one of the two probands with colon cancer and tooth agenesis, in four siblings with tooth agenesis but not colon cancer, and in one unaffected sibling (no colon cancer and no tooth agenesis). No AXIN2 mutations were found in the second proband.","Prompted by the discovery of an association between colon polyps and cancer with tooth agenesis, several investigators have examined the potential for a colon neoplasia predisposition and WNT-signaling pathways genes from different perspectives. Peterlongo et al. [9] searched for AXIN2 mutations in 82 familial (CRC families in which other syndromes had been ruled out. They found 29 DNA variants, none of which appeared likely to be pathogenic. Mostowska et al. [10] studied 55 Caucasians from Poland with missing teeth (nearly half had true oligodontia) and observed an increased risk of tooth agenesis in individuals carrying the AXIN2 c.956 + 16G allele (OR = 2.94; 95% CI = 1.10-7.82; p = 0.03) and the c.2062 T allele (OR = 4.01; 95% CI = 1.56-10.30; p = 0.02). Lejeune et al. [11] studied 39 patients with multiple adenomas and no APC mutation nor DNA mismatch repair defect and found one person with two variants of uncertain significance in AXIN2. Callahan et al. [12] studied 167 individuals with tooth agenesis (majority with only 1-2 teeth missing) and found an association between missing incisors and one of three intragenic polymorphisms in the AXIN2 gene. The most significant association was for a missense mutation in exon 10 (P50S, rs2240308) with a p-value of 0.037, and they concluded that their work provided further evidence that AXIN2 contributes to tooth agenesis. This suggested relationship between AXIN2 and tooth agenesis also led to findings that AXIN2 gene variants may have a role in cleft lip/palate in multiple populations [13], with and without the presence of tooth agenesis as part of the clinical phenotype [14]. In a study of families with cleft lip and/or palate, a family history of cancer was reported more often than in control families with higher rates of specific cancer types including colon (p < 0.001) [15]. Most recently, Marvin et al. [16] reported a novel protein truncating AXIN2 mutation (c.1989G > A; p.Try663X) that segregated in an autosomal-dominant pattern with colonic polyposis, gastric polyps, and a mild ectodermal dysplasia phenotype.This current study was conducted to evaluate self-reported missing teeth as a potential marker for predisposition to CRC. We did not find that participants with CRC were any more likely to report missing teeth than their unaffected relatives or unrelated controls. To not form one or more of the normal 20 deciduous teeth and 32 permanent teeth is said to be one of the most common developmental anomalies in humans.Approximately 20% of humans will have at least one missing third molar (“wisdom teeth”) and 3-10% have failure of formation for one or more of the other permanent teeth (reviewed in Nieminen 2009 reference). Both our CRC cases and the unaffected control group reported frequencies of missing teeth consistent with this range. The term hypodontia is a term used to describe only a few missing teeth, while oligodontia refers to a more severe anomaly with six or more missing teeth. True oligodontia is quite rare, affecting 0.1-0.2% of the population [17]. Seven of 4244 (0.16%) individuals in this study reported true oligodontia, also in keeping with the literature; thus, the self-reported nature of this study is a limitation but the reported values are consistent with other studies. In general, failure to form one or more permanent teeth (excluding third molars) is reported to be about twice as common in females as in males, and again, our data reflect that trend.Overall, this study did not provide support for there being a general predisposition to missing teeth among a large cohort of CRC patients. It does not, however, rule out the likelihood that a small percentage of individuals may have germline variants in genes that predisposed them to both CRC and missing teeth. It may be that if a population of people with oligodontia were surveyed for cancer risks, one might still find that this is a marker for colorectal neoplasia but that oligodontia is so uncommon as to not be appreciable in a study of the size we conducted.Of note, tooth agenesis is a common, multifactorial birth defect and can be sporadic or familial (inherited as dominant, recessive, or X-linked), and present variable penetrance in affected families [17]. It also presents variable prevalence rates among different ethnic backgrounds; therefore, the use of family-based studies may allow detection of segregation between different phenotypes and improve the likelihood of gene discovery in affected families.
AXIN2 mutations have been regarded as causative for the segregation of CRC and oligodontia in a Finnish family [3]. In the present study, we sequenced the AXIN2 gene locus in two probands presenting colon cancer and tooth agenesis (although the milder form, hypodontia) and having relatives with tooth agenesis. We found a common missense variant (P50S, rs2240308; minor allele frequency approximately 0.35 in North America) in one of the probands. Five of this proband’s siblings including an unaffected sister (without tooth agenesis) also presented the variant. The AXIN2 P50S variant is unlikely related to the familial tooth agenesis or the colon cancer phenotype in this family. Additional, and yet possibly unknown genes, may be contributing to the segregation of these two different clinical phenotypes. Additional studies are underway to molecularly characterize the relevant genes in this population, with special attention to those few families that did report familial hypo- or oligodontia."
1,Polymorphisms within inflammatory genes and colorectal cancer,"Epidemiological and biological data show a clear association between chronic inflammatory conditions and subsequent malignant transformation in the inflamed tissue [1]. Inflammatory state is typically accompanied by generation of free radicals, stimulation of cytokines, chemokines, and growth and angiogenic factors that favor tumorigenesis by damaging DNA [2, 3], stimulating angiogenesis [4], and by inducing cell proliferation [5, 6]. Following these considerations, some pro-inflammatory genes have been shown to be important for the maintenance and progression of cancer [7], including colorectal cancer (CRC) [8, 9].Toll-like and CD14 receptors are examples of pattern recognition receptors that detect antigenic molecules on the surface of gram-positive (peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acid) and gram-negative (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) bacteria [10]. Polymorphisms of TLR4 gene appear to be able to alter inflammatory responses in numerous experimental and clinical models of inflammation. Asp299Gly polymorphism [dbSNP: rs4986790] within TLR4 has been investigated by several groups and associated with an increased response to LPS [11]. CD14 is a gene preferentially expressed on monocytes/macrophages generating a surface protein. It binds lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and recently has been shown to bind apoptotic cells [10]. The polymorphism -260 T>C [dbSNP: rs2569190] has been shown to increase transcriptional activity by lowering the affinity of the GC box for Sp3, a factor known to inhibit the activity of a number of promoters. This enhanced transcriptional activity has been associated with higher concentrations of soluble CD14 and enhanced CD14 expression on the membrane of the monocytes [12].MCP-1 is a chemokine that is thought to be responsible for monocyte and T-lymphocytes recruitment in acute inflammatory conditions and may be an important mediator in chronic inflammation. The G allele of -2518 A>G MCP1 polymorphism [dbSNP: rs1024611] was found to increase MCP-1 expression [13].IL12A encodes a subunit (alpha) of a cytokine that is required for the T-cell-independent induction of interferon (IFN)-gamma. IL-12 was believed to be unique in its ability to induce the differentiation of native T cells toward the TH1 phenotype and in its pathogenic activity, as shown in various disease models including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [14]. SNPs in the regulatory sequence of IL12A are presumed to be associated with the differential production of this cytokine [15].Focusing on pathways involved more specifically in chronic inflammatory bowel disorders and CRC, the nitric oxide (NO) is a versatile molecule with actions ranging from haemodynamic regulation to anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells [16]. NO is produced by the nitric oxide synthases, endothelial NOS (eNOS), neural NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). NOS2A is the encoding gene for the inducible NOS. It is required for the signalling process in the innate immunity [17] and it plays a central role on chronic inflammatory bowel disorders [18].Tumor necrosis factor (TNF; formerly known as TNFα) and lymphotoxin-α (LTA), originally characterized by their ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis and cachexia, are now considered as central mediators of a broad range of biological activities (for a review see [19] and [20]). These activities encompass beneficial effects for the host in inflammation and in protective immune responses against a variety of infectious pathogens [21]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the core members of the TNF superfamily, including LTα, play an essential role during the organogenesis of secondary lymphoid organs and the maintenance of the architecture of lymphatic tissues [21]. Although a large study did not show association between polymorphisms within LTA-TNF region on chromosome 6 and IBD [22], the role of LTA in the etiology of IBD has been well ascertained in mice [23].Several lines of evidence suggest that cyclo-oxygenases (COX) 1 and 2 enzymes, encoded by PTGS1 and PTGS2 genes, play a significant role in colon carcinogenesis. For example, rapid metabolism of arachidonic acid and elevated levels of COX enzymes are found in several cancers, including CRC [24]. In addition, COX enzymes have been shown to stimulate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and to inhibit apoptosis [25]. During the inflammatory state COX enzymes are elevated, thus the regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could be associated with a reduced risk of CRC, through their inhibition [26]. While COX-2 is rapidly inducible and its expression is usually elevated at sites of inflammation, COX-1 is considered constitutive and is thought to be the main responsible for the cytoprotective production of prostaglandins. However, the traditional description of COX-1 as a purely constitutive, housekeeping gene has been recently challenged by several studies, which have found that COX-1 production can also be regulated at the transcriptional level [27].In previous investigations, we performed a case-control association study on several polymorphisms in genes involved in the inflammation (namely: IL6, IL8, PPARG, TNF, NFKB1 and PTGS2) and we found associations with the risk of sporadic colorectal cancer [9, 28]. In the present study, in order to evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within more inflammatory genes were associated with the risk to develop CRC, we investigate ten SNPs in the following inflammatory genes: TLR4 (Asp299Gly), CD14 (-260 T>C), MCP1 (-2518 A>G), IL12A (+7506 A>T, +8707 A>G, +9177 T>A, +9508 G>A), NOS2A (+524T>C), TNF (-857C>T), and PTGS1 (V444I) in 377 cases and 326 controls.","Each polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls. The main effects related to each polymorphism by case/control status are shown in Table 1. The odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are shown for the codominant model. For the variant V444I within PTGS1, we found an allele frequency too low to draw any conclusion, and a much larger study is necessary to characterize better whether this SNP could play any role in the risk of CRC. All the other polymorphisms investigated showed clearly a lack of statistically significant association with CRC. The dominant or log-additive models did not change substantially the results (data not shown). No association was found when cases were classified according to cancer site (rectal, left colon or right colon, data not shown). The analyses for association based on interactions of these polymorphisms with dietary variables (alcohol, tobacco, coffee, vegetables, meat and meat products, fats, fruits, BMI, calories) did not elicit any statistical association (data not shown).Table 1 Odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for colorectal cancer by genotypes under investigation.Full size tableThe lack of association can be due to three main reasons. First. In spite of the importance of the inflammation for the carcinogenic process of the colorectum, we, unfortunately, selected some of the inflammatory genes that do not have a role in this process. Second. It is also possible that, indeed, the genes have a role for CRC, however the selected polymorphisms do not have biological effects for CRC. Third, it is possible that some of the SNPs have a small effect, which undergo undetected unless studied by analysing a much larger sample size. Although the present study does not seem to support a role for inflammatory polymorphisms, it should be stressed that our previous work did show a role for a polymorphism within the promoter of IL6 and the polymorphism at codon 12 of PPARG [9]. However, IL6 and PPARG may be considered also as part of alternative pathways not directly linked to inflammation. IL6 is involved in the cross-talk between neutrophiles passed into the colon lumen and colocytes [9], whereas PPARG is involved in the resistance to insuline [9], thus, overall, our results seems to point towards other mechanisms, rather than stressing the role of inflammation for the CRC.","According to the results of our study, we conclude that the SNPs analysed do not have a strong impact on the risk of CRC.","Cases (n = 377) were patients with a new diagnosis of CRC attending a University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, between January 1996 and December 1998. All cases have had histological confirmation of their tumor diagnosis. Participation rate among cases was 72%. Cases who did not participate in the study were similar to those included with respect to age, sex, tumor location, and extent.Controls (n = 326) were randomly selected among patients admitted to the same hospital during the same period. To avoid selection bias, only incident cases were selected. Participation rate among controls was 69.4%. All subjects had the same ethnicity (Caucasian). The ethical committee of the hospital approved the study and subjects gave informed consent at recruitment. Interviews of cases and controls were performed by trained personnel, using a structured test to determine demographic characteristics and potential risk factors for CRC. A more detailed report on study design has been previously published [9]. SNPs were selected based on previous publications from the literature. An extensive literature research was carried out with the aim to study the potential role of some inflammatory SNPs for CRC, once the information was available for other studies.Genotyping was carried out with the 5' nuclease assay (TaqMan) by minor groove binder (MGB) probes fluorescently labelled with FAM or VIC and using the protocol recommended by the supplier (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To ensure quality control, DNA samples from cases and controls were randomly distributed on PCR plates, and all genotyping was conducted by personnel who were blinded to case – control status. Only genotype calls scored concordantly by two independent trained operators were retained. Finally, a random 8% of the samples were re-genotyped blindly. The probes and primers for the genotyping reactions are reported in Table 2. More details on the genotyping technique were reported previously [9].Table 2 PCR primer and TaqMan® Probe SequencesFull size tableEach polymorphism was tested in controls to ensure that it was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To test the hypothesis of association between genetic polymorphisms and CRC, multivariate methods based on logistic regression analyses were used. When cases were subdivided into groups, polytomous logistic regression was used, comparing each group of cases with the whole set of controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each group compared to the homozygotes for the most common allele (set as having risk = 1). For polymorphisms, homozygosity for the more frequent allele among controls was set as the reference class. Analyses were initially performed under a co-dominant model (three genotypes separated). A log-additive model to assess the effect of each additional rare allele and a codominant model were also explored to increase the statistical power. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex and p values were derived from likelihood ratio tests. More details concerning the statistical analyses were published previously [9].The sample size of our study, for a rare allele frequency of 5%, is enough to detect ORs greater than 2 with more than 90% power assuming a log-additive model. For allele frequencies of 15%, the power to detect an OR of 1.5 is 82%. For allele frequencies of 35% as observed for some SNPs in this study, the power to detect an OR of 1.3 is 66%."
2,Identification of Schizosaccharomyces pombe in the guts of healthy individuals and patients with colorectal cancer: preliminary evidence from a gut microbiome secretome study,"Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been postulated to be the causative event in colorectal cancer (CRC). For many years, most microbiome studies focused primarily on genetic sequencing and the subsequent identification of gut bacteria; however, the role of bacteria in CRC carcinogenesis remains unclear. We hypothesised that protein secretions from these microorganisms play a role in the pathophysiology of CRC. We aimed to identify and compare the secreted proteins released from the human gut microflora by assessing the stool samples of both patients with CRC and healthy control individuals.","A pilot study was performed at the endoscopy unit and surgery and medical clinics at the UKM Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, from 2016 to 2017. Stool samples from 26 patients with clinically diagnosed CRC and 20 non-CRC control individuals were collected from the UKM Medical Centre. The samples were homogenised and filtered, followed by precipitation with acetone, reduction with dl-Dithiothreitol, alkylation with iodoacetamide and digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analysed by reverse-phase LC–ESI–MS/MS using Eksigent NanoLC system connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight 5600+ TripleTOF™ mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, USA). Briefly, mass spectra were acquired in the data-dependent mode (250 ms accumulation time per spectrum and mass range of 300–1250 m/z) to obtain MS/MS spectra for the most abundant parent ions following each survey MS1 scan. For each mass spectrum, a maximum of 50 precursors with a charge state between 2 and 4 were selected for fragmentation. The tandem mass spectrum was acquired in the high-sensitivity mode, in which the signals were accumulated for a minimum of 50 ms per spectrum, and the dynamic exclusion time was set at 24 s.The mass spectrum datasets were searched using MaxQuant against the microbial UniProt Fasta database (accessed on 18 September 2017). Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Functional and integrative analyses of the identified proteins were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [1] and MetaboAnalyst 4.0 [2] online tools, respectively.","We identified 2132 proteins secreted by the gut flora (1370 from bacteria; 589 from fungi; 112 from archaea; 45 from viruses to 16 from parasites), with 96 proteins specific to CRC. In contrast, 2035 proteins were exclusive to the non-CRC controls. Only one bacterial protein from Borrelia recurrentis was commonly secreted in both CRC and non-CRC groups. Interestingly, we found that vast protein secretions were mapped to S. pombe, which were not previously reported in the human gut. S. pombe, a fission yeast, is traditionally used in brewing. Its 50 genes are similar to human genes associated with diseases, with 23 genes similar to human cancer genes [3]. This yeast has been widely used as a model organism to study human diseases and pathological events, such as cancer and ageing [4, 5]. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has shown the association between S. pombe and human diseases.In our study, a total of 124 proteins secreted by S. pombe were exclusively found in the control samples. Five proteins found in the CRC samples were successfully mapped to the yeast. The distribution of the secretome proteins identified from the yeast was skewed towards the control samples compared with the CRC samples (Fig. 1). We also observed great variation in the secretome of S. pombe in the studied individuals, regardless of the presence or absence of CRC or early- or late-stage CRC, as revealed by discriminant and heat-map analyses. However, all the secretome proteins from S. pombe identified in the CRC were of high intensity, with four proteins exclusively secreted in the late stage of CRC (DNA repair protein rhp57; SWR1 complex bromodomain subunit bdf1; structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 5 and uncharacterised WD repeat-containing protein C16H5.13). In contrast, the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex subunit 8 was secreted in the early stage of CRC.Fig. 1Distribution of secretome proteins identified from S. pombe in the gut of patients with CRC and control individuals. a Heat-map analysis revealed individual variation in secreted proteins by S. pombe; b discriminant analysis showed that proteins from S. pombe were well-discriminated between the CRC and control groups; c different sets of proteins were identified from S. pombe during the late and early stages of CRCFull size image","The importance of mycobiota in gut health has been recently postulated. The study of these fungi may provide new therapeutic approaches. Of note, the current probiotics paradigm has shifted from the use of bacteria to yeast [6]. However, little is known about the role of these naturally occurring mycobiota in the gut microenvironment and their effects on the host (e.g., contributing to health or diseases), particularly chronic effects at the molecular level. We suggest that distinctive sets of S. pombe proteins be used as markers to distinguish between individuals with and without CRC. It is still unknown if the proteins secreted by S. pombe identified in this study result in tumorigenesis or vice versa. Thus, further investigation is warranted."
3,"Nutrition, metabolism and colorectal cancer","Mortality for colorectal cancer (CRC) and for myocardial infarction (MI) are associated at population level [39]. Correa et al. [7] found in an autopsy study on 842 autopsies, that the most extensive atherosclerotic involvement of the aorta was in subjects with adenomatous polyps of the colon, and even more in subjects with adenonomatous and hyperplastic polyps together. Furthermore, Stemmerman [35] in an autopsy study on 288 autopsies found that the degree of the atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and aorta was positively and significantly related not only to the presence of adenomatous polyps, but also to their size, multiplicity and degree of atypia as well.MI and CRC can share a common cause, a common intermediate factor or both. In this review we explore the possibility that MI and CRC not only share some common cause, but also some common intermediate factors.","It is known that MI is associated with high blood cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol [22], however these associations are weaker and even uncertain in old people [29]. Furthermore, MI is associated with the metabolic syndrome and with diabetes [15].In non-diabetic subjects, MI is associated with HbA1c [16], as well as with fructosamine, an index of glycated proteins in the blood, at least in women [4], and with glycated apolipoprotein B [28].Several studies have evaluated the association between serum cholesterol and colorectal adenomatous polyps or carcinoma in situ [1, 2, 8, 13, 19, 20, 24, 40]. Most but not all of these studies found an association of colorectal adenoma or cancer in situ with serum cholesterol. Serum triglycerides were associated with colorectal adenoma [25, 32], and with colorectal cancer in situ [40]. CRC was found associated with the metabolic syndrome [6, 37]. CRC and adenomas are associated with diabetes or prediabetes [14, 17, 18, 21, 23, 30, 33, 38, 41]. We found that fructosamine is associated with colorectal adenoma [27], as well as glycated apolipoprotein B with colorectal adenoma and cancer (Misciagna et al., unpublished data).","The association of both MI and CRC with blood lipids and non enzymatic glycated serum proteins also in non diabetic subjects allows to study the effects of diet on MI and CRC through the effects of diet on these intermediate variables. Cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are influenced by both saturated fats and sugars in the diet [5, 9], glycated haemoglobin is influenced by saturated fats in the diet [3, 11, 12], fructosamine by glycemic index and load [26], as well as glycated apolipoprotein B (Misciagna et al., unpublished data). All these results show that MI and CRC are associated with a diet rich in saturated fats and at high glycemic index and load.","The results of many epidemiological studies show that MI and CRC share many intermediate variables: cholesterol, cholesterol HDL, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin and apoliprotein B, fructosamine. Furthermore, using the relationship of diet with these intermediate blood variables, it is possible to deduce that dietary saturated fats, glycemic index and load are associated with CRC and MI. The discovery of blood intermediate variables between diet and MI and CRC can open the way to trials of the effects of diet on these variables, to add evidence to the results of the observational epidemiological studies on diet and cardiovascular diseases or colorectal cancer.Myocardial infarction and colorectal cancer share some dietary causes and intermediate variables, do they share also some pathogenetic mechanisms ?Glycated ApoB has been found in the macrophages of the arterial wall, in the fatty streaks of atherosclerotic vessels [36]. In fact, macrophages prefer glycated, oxidized or glyco-oxidized lipoproteins for their scavenger receptors, not the normal ones [34].It is known that neoplastic cells behave like a macrophage and have a strong phagocytic activity [10, 31], so may be colorectal cancer too, like the macrophages of the arterial wall in atherosclerosis, “eats” glycated lipoprotein."
