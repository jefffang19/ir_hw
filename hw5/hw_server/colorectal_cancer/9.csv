0,Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) in a patient receiving bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer: a case report,"Severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) (SOSVOD) represents a life-threatening complication of dose-intensive chemotherapy. Conventional doses of certain antitumour agents such as 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine have been reported to initiate hepatic SOSVOD in isolated cases [1]. We present the first case of a patient with colon cancer who, while receiving bevacizumab, developed SOSVOD.","A 77-year-old man presented with rectal bleeding in December 1998 due to carcinoma of the ascending colon and subsequently underwent right hemicolectomy, The tumour was staged as Dukes B. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given at that time. In August 1999 he developed disease recurrence in the liver (Figure 1a) and was treated with 12 cycles of oxaliplatin and a modified de Gramont regimen of 5-fluorouracil (OxMdg) with a good response (Figure 1b). In October 2000 he underwent left hepatic trisectionectomy, involving resection of hepatic segments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8, and liver remnant metastasectomies of segments 1, 6 and 7, along with revision of the right hemicolectomy due to local recurrence. There was no evidence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in the hepatectomy specimen. His liver enzymes and synthetic function returned to normal after this.Figure 1

He developed further extensive nodal recurrence both supra- and infra-diaphragmatically in November 2004 and was rechallenged with OxMdg. Bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg (675 mg) was added to the regimen from the seventh cycle onwards and was given every 4 weeks. Protracted neutropenia and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation of oxaliplatin after the ninth cycle. His liver function tests at the time of discontinuing oxaliplatin were bilirubin 17 μmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 134 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 87 IU/l and albumin 30 g/l. 5-fluorouracil was stopped after cycle 11 due to a computed tomography (CT) scan in July 2005 showing a complete response.Maintenance bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) was continued as a single agent. In September 2005 he developed right hypochondrial pain and liver function tests showed raised bilirubin 26 μmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 217 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 99 IU/l and albumin 30 g/l along with persistent thrombocytopenia (<100 × 109/l). He was not on any other medications which would significantly alter the liver function tests. CT scan showed oesophageal varices (Figure 1c), new ascites and splenomegaly (Figure 1d). The ascitic fluid was transudate with no evidence of malignant cells. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed oesophageal varices, a Barrett's oesophagus and portal gastropathy. These findings were all consistent with an intrahepatic cause of portal hypertension. Liver biopsy showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia (Figure 2a) and pericellular fibrosis (Figure 2b) with a predominantly centrilobular distribution, but no definite occluded vessels were seen. There was no evidence of cirrhosis. These features were considered to be consistent with SOSVOD.Figure 2

Subsequently, bevacizumab was stopped in October 2005 and a policy of watchful waiting was adopted. The patient recovered from the acute damage to his liver and subsequently the ascites resolved and liver function tests normalized. As of September 2007 the patient remains in complete remission but with persistent thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and gastroesophageal junction varices.","There have been no reports so far correlating bevacizumab with SOSVOD. Bevacizumab blocks the circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which serves as an autocrine factor for the induction of neovascularization. Also it acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, protecting them from hypoxia, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In normal tissues its action is stabilisation of mature cells. It has a beneficial effect in angiogenesis during wound healing [2].Our patient had had a partial hepatectomy (trisectionectomy) in the past and had also received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, a drug recently found to cause hepatic sinusoidal dilatation in hepatectomy specimens. To date we have been unable to find any references on oxaliplatin associated with any clinical signs or symptoms of SOSVOD[3, 4]. Blue liver syndrome as a consequence of VOD after the use of oxaliplatin has been reported by Bilchik et al. [5]. In our patient there was no evidence of blue liver syndrome in the hepatectomy specimen after the use of neoadjuvant oxaliplatin.Potential explanations of the occurrence of the syndrome are possible blockage of the normal repair mechanisms induced by the VEGF, direct toxic action of the bevacizumab to the hepatic sinusoids or idiosyncratic and/or hypersensitivity reaction.",We need to be aware that bevacizumab can cause sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) and that the occurrence of ascites should not be attributed to progressive disease without appropriate evaluation.
1,Pancreatectomy for metastasis to the pancreas from colorectal cancer and reconstruction of superior mesenteric vein: a case report,"Though pancreatic metastases from colorectal cancer are very rare and the mid-term results of surgery have not been clearly defined yet, pancreatic resection has been suggested in selected patients with isolated metastases from colorectal cancer and/or limited extra-pancreatic disease [1, 2].The most common unexpected finding at the time of pancreaticoduodenectomy in pancreatic carcinoma of the head and uncinate process is the invasion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or superior mesenteric portal vein (SMV/PV) confluence, located anteriorly, laterally, or posterolaterally [3, 4]. The current literature suggests that portal vein and/or SMV invasion is not a contraindication to pancreatic resection, provided that these veins are not occluded [5]. In this report, we describe a case of resection of the SMV and restoration of its continuity by inter-position of an autologous superficial femoral vein (SFV) graft, since few data exist about SMV reconstruction with a SFV graft during pancreatectomy.","A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a history of right hemi-colectomy one year earlier (due to adenocarcinoma of the right colon) was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss. His laboratory values, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) were not indicative of any distinctive pathology. Therefore, the general surgeons decided to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy, based on the patient's recent hemi-colectomy and the high clinical suspicion of a metachronous metastatic insult of the pancreas.A metastatic tumor was identified in the uncinate process of the pancreas. During the dissection and preparation, the SMV involvement was identified on its anterior surface superiorly to the confluence of the middle colic vein at the level of the transverse mesocolon. No involvement of the superior mesenteric artery was identified. When it was decided that the tumor could be resected with a sufficient macroscopic margin, a duodenopancreatectomy was performed. Sufficient resection with healthy margins was documented by intra-operative histology. The tumor adhered only to the SMV, with the latter caudally divided at the point where the SMV emerged.Accordingly, a right mid-thigh incision was performed, and an adequate SFV segment up to the junction with the profunda femoris vein was harvested. The duration from the vein preparation and harvest to skin closure was 15 to 20 minutes. During the venous reconstruction, a solution of 5000 U of heparin was delivered locally through the SMV. No valvulotomy was performed. The pancreatic head resection was immediately followed by the construction of a proximal anastomosis between a non-reversed SFV segment 3 cm to 4 cm in length and the central stump of the SMV in an end-to-end fashion (Figure 1). The peripheral anastomosis was created in a similar fashion. The duration of the creation of each anastomosis was 10 minutes. Intra-operatively, the patency of the reconstruction was confirmed by a continuous wave Doppler signal. The operation was completed with the creation of pancreatojejunostomy and a new ileotransversostomy.Figure 1

The patient's post-operative instructions included the administration of a prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin, limb elevation, and application of compression stockings (class II). During the immediate post-operative and follow-up phase (six months), only mild edema of the leg was marked. The SFV inter-position graft showed good patency (Figure 2) on color duplex ultrasonography.Figure 2

","Pancreatic resection is sometimes combined with reconstruction of the major veins with venous grafts [6]. The vein reconstruction can be applied more frequently than anticipated pre-operatively, since pre-operative imaging can present false estimation of the SMV/PV invasion and CT may not differentiate tumor invasion from inflammatory adhesion [4, 7]. The aforementioned examples justify the need for vascular intra-operative consultation, as in our case. From the surgical point of view, it is only when the neck of the pancreas has been divided that the degree of SMV involvement can be assessed to further proceed to SMV/PV resection and reconstruction [8].Several types of conduits have been utilized for the reconstruction of the SMV, including mostly autogenous vein grafts and, in some cases, synthetic polytetrafluorethylene grafts. The avoidance of the infection risk regarding the pancreatoduodenectomy favors the autogenous conduits. Apart from the commonly used saphenous vein (SV) and SMV, autologous reconstructions with the internal jugular vein, left renal vein, and gonadal veins have also been reported. The SFV provides an excellent size match (7 mm to 12 mm in diameter and 40 to 50 cm in length) for the SMV/PV site compared with the SV [9]. Generally, the SV is preferred for SMV patching, whereas the SFV is preferred as an inter-position conduit. Lee et al. [4] suggested performing reconstruction of the SMV/PV with a vein patch when less than one-third of the vessel circumference is involved, whereas an inter-position fashion is the preferred option when there is a greater degree of vessel involvement. Careful preservation of the junction of the profunda femoris vein with the common femoral vein remains a key note for the prevention of excessive venous hypertension.Immediately post-operatively and after six months, our patient had only mild edema and no discomfort. There seemed to be no significant difference in the measurement of the circumference of the harvested limb compared with the unharvested limb (thigh, proximal calf, mid-calf, and ankle). As long as the SFV harvest does not extend into the popliteal segment and the profunda femoral vein is preserved, the generation of severe venous hypertension and the consequent need for prophylactic fasciotomies is precluded. The minimal mid-term to late-term lower-limb venous morbidity could be attributed to the preservation of collaterals and the low incidence of mild reflux despite the venous outflow obstruction, provided that the venous valves are intact and competent. The deep vein harvest results in venous outflow obstruction. This in turn generates pooling of blood in the periphery and consequent poor apposition of the venous valve leaflets, leading to functional venous reflux, thus underscoring the clinical utility of compression stockings. These pathophysiologic features could explain why SFV harvest is so well tolerated in contrast to the valve damage caused by venous thrombosis.","The SFV can be an excellent conduit for SMV reconstruction because of its size and availability, good mid-term patency, and low peri-operative and post-operative venous morbidity. Surgeons should be aware of and prepared for the unexpected need to perform venous reconstruction with a SFV conduit. Adherence to technical perfection makes SFV an excellent conduit with minimal morbidity."
2,Intraarticular hemorrhage due to bevacizumab in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer: a case report,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women. should be: ""It is also the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. Survival rates have increased from 41% to 66% between 1950 and 2000. The main reason for this improvement is the use of effective cytotoxic therapies such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Targeted therapies beginning with bevacizumab in 2004 have improved the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer up to two years [2].Bevacizumab is the first angiogenesis inhibitor that binds and inactivates all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It has some specific side effects including severe bleeding, wound healing problems, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria and hypertension. Hemorrhages are usually related to metastasis or primary tumor itself. No case of intraarticular bleeding due to bevacizumab has been reported previously in the literature. We report the case of a man with knee joint metastasis from colon adenocarcinoma who experienced intraarticular hemorrhage subsequent to bevacizumab treatment.","A 65-year-old Asian man was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer and treated with adjuvant fluorouracil and leucoverin. After six years he had a relapse with brain and lung metastates. After cranial metastasectomy, he was treated with full brain radiotherapy. Chemotherapy with capecitabine and bevacizumab was started (capecitabine 1000mg/m² twice a day one to 14 days, bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg on the first day, every 21 days). Oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy could not be given due to his poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score. The lung lesion was resected after partial response to six cycles of chemotherapy. He discontinued therapy and did not come to control visits. After three months he presented to our clinic with weight loss, weakness and pain in his left knee. His carcinoembryonic antigen was increased and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET- CT) revealed multiple liver, lung and bone metastasis. Bevacizumab and capecitabine was restarted at the same dose and frequency as he had received previously. After the first course of this regimen, he presented with monoarthritis in the left knee. Physical examination revealed tenderness, swelling and reduced mobility. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin value of 10.2g/dL; white blood count of 7800/mm3 (Normal ratio 10,800) and C-reactive protein of 0.45mg/dl (Normal ratio <0.4mg/dL). The left knee was aspirated and yielded hemorrhagic fluid. He had no history of a traumatic event or use of warfarin, heparin or acetylsalicylic acid. He had no history of hemorrhagic diathesis. Coagulation parameters were normal. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed synovial metastasis of the knee (Figure 1). Cytologic examination was not done and he refused to have an arthroscopic biopsy. Bevacizumab was stopped and palliative radiotherapy (3000cGy in 10 fractions) to the left knee region was administered to relieve the symptoms.Figure 1

In short TI reversion proton density (STIR PD) sequences; sagittal plane images, there is a lesion in the femur medial condyle epiphyseal-metaphyseal line which has a peripheral hyperintense signal and shows edematous changes in the near bone. In the same sequences, there is an increase of synovial fluid in the suprapatellar pouch and at this location there is another poor hyperintense lesion (bone and synovial metastasis).Full size image
","This is the first case of bevacizumab-related intraarticular bleeding reported in the literature. Intraarticular hemorrhage was associated with the synovial metastasis of the left knee. Synovial metastasis is a rare entity; it is usually seen in solid tumors. Only a few reported cases of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the synovium can be found in the literature [3–6]. The differential diagnoses of monoarthritis in a patient with cancer include inflammatory diseases such as gout, avascular necrosis and septic arthritis which could be complications of chemotherapy. Various rheumatic disorders may also be seen [7]. In this patient bleeding stopped after discontinuation of bevacizumab and he had palliative radiation therapy to the left knee. Surgical procedures such as palliative synovectomy are also possible. If these measures fail and joint instability causes significant pain external or internal fixation may be considered.Bevacizumab is the first angiogenesis inhibitor that binds and inactivates all isoforms of VEGF. The most common side effects are hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal symptoms and poor wound healing. Infrequent serious adverse events include gastrointestinal perforation, arterial thrombotic events and hemorrhage [8]. Severe and life-threatening (Grade 3 or 4) bleeding has occurred among three to four percent of the patients who received bevacizumab. Hemorrhages are usually related to metastasis or the primary tumor itself. Bleeding events usually appear as epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoptysis, vaginal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage and occur five times more often in patients treated with bevacizumab [8]. The most common form of hemorrhage is mild epistaxis that lasts less than five minutes and usually resolves without medication. These bleedings do not require discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy [9].The mechanism underlying bevacizumab-related bleeding is not fully understood. It is probably associated with the inhibition of VEGF signaling. VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, promotes endothelial cell survival and helps to maintain the vascular integrity. Inhibition of VEGF can reduce the regenerative capacity of endothelial cells [10]. However, endothelial cell defects alone cannot explain the life-threatening hemorrhages in patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy; damage of the major vessel wall by tumor erosion, necrosis, cavitation and other pathologic conditions may have a role [10].",Bevacizumab-related hemorrhage can cause serious morbidity even mortality. Unusual sites of hemorrhage may be seen. Clinicians should examine the symptoms of monoarthritis carefully in patients treated with bevacizumab and should not continue the therapy until they rule out intraarticular hemorrhage.
3,Hereditary Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Program in Latvia,"During the last decade dramatic changes have taken place in the diagnosis and management of familial/hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes. New developments are offering possibilities of early cancer detection, improvements in treatment and preventive measures for the affected and persons at risk of disease. Hereditary cancer management has developed as an essential part of modern oncology treatment and current practice reveals the importance of cancer genetic services in providing the best care for hereditary cancer syndrome patients.Latvia is an East European country located in the Baltic region with approximately 2.4 million of inhabitants. In the year 2002 there were 8977 new cancer cases detected in Latvia, including 926 colorectal cancer cases. From all newly diagnosed cancers only 17.4% were detected in stage I, and 22.9% in stage of the II disease. According to epidemiological data available for familial colorectal cancer, one would expect somewhere in between 90 and 130 familial cases in Latvia annually. From this estimate, 20-60 of them are most likely to be associated with hereditary condition (either HNPCC or FAP). Detection and appropriate management of patients affected with disease or those with an increased risk of developing it would provide a considerable improvement in oncology care in Latvia.Active investigations and research into hereditary cancers in Latvia began almost ten years ago [1]. However, clinical work on hereditary cancer syndromes became more widely accepted in 1998, when the Department of Surgery, Riga Stradins University was invited to participate in the European Commission funded Copernicus multicenter project entitled: Phenotype - genotype correlations in HNPCC and MENI (IC15 - CT98 - 0305). Since its success was readily apparent the international collaboration was extended within the EC 5th framework programme - Development of network of cancer family syndrome registries in Eastern Europe (QLRI-CT-1999-00063). During the 2nd year of this project, the Hereditary Cancer Institute of Riga Stradins University was established. The main aim of this institution is to study the hereditary cancer syndromes in the population of Latvia and to introduce the obtained knowledge into clinical practice.In the following article we would like to report results of this study, which is taking place in the framework of the hereditary colorectal cancer program in Latvia. The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence and phenotype/genotype characteristics of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes in Latvia in order to develop a rational basis for the clinical management of patients and their relatives affected by these syndromes.","From February 1999 to September 2002 cancer family histories were collected from 865 patients with colorectal cancer in the largest oncology hospitals of Latvia. Patients completed questionnaires that included questions, which asked: Had your relatives (father, mother, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles) been diagnosed with any tumor? What was the localization of the tumor? At what age was the tumor detected?Criteria applied for the diagnosis of hereditary colorectal cancers are summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Diagnostic criteria for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromesFull size tableIn individuals from families matching criteria for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, genetic testing for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 mutations using DHPLC and concomitant DNA sequencing of all heteroduplexes was performed [8–13] after obtaining written informed consent from each patient. If material was available immunohistochemical examination of the normal and cancer tissue from large bowel for MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression was performed before DNA sequencing. The Ethics Commission, Riga Stradins University, accepted the protocol for the study.","From the 865 colorectal cancer patients 402 (46.47%) cases did not report any malignancy in their families. In 463 (53.53%) colorectal cancer cases there was at least one malignancy among blood relatives. Only 3 (0.35%) pedigrees fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria. Unfortunately, histopathological confirmation of cancer in affected family members of those 3 pedigrees was not possible. One patient (0.12%) fulfilled late onset HNPCC criteria. Fourteen individuals (1.62%) matched the criteria of suspected HNPCC. In 41 (4.74%) patients the suspicion of familial colorectal cancer was diagnosed. In 69 cases (8%) CFA was detected. Currently, 27 immunohistochemical examinations have been performed. In 3 tumors MSH2 or MSH6 protein expression was homogenously negative suggesting a germline mutation in either one of these genes. In 1 of these cases mutation in MSH6 gene (exon 4, 1815-1816delTA) was detected. The pedigree of this family matched late onset HNPCC criteria. In an additional 25 patients DNA sequencing of MLH1 and MSH2 genes was performed. One MLH1 and two MSH2 mutations were identified. The pedigree of the family with a mutation in MLH1 (ex12 (G/A 1409+1 out of frame del) is shown on Fig. 1. Due to lack of any medical confirmation for cancer diagnosis in the probands' relatives this pedigree was classified as belonging to the CFA syndrome.Figure 1Pedigree of the MLH1 (c.1409+1G/A) family; Tr, transversum; Ut, uterus; FGT, female genital tract; The numbers following abbreviations indicate the age of cancer diagnosis; Arrow indicates the proband.Full size imageTwo hMSH2 mutations were detected in ex3 (C508T; Gln170Stop) and ex12 (c.1786delAAT; 596delAsn) respectively. Both families fulfilled the suspected HNPCC criteria.For all of the families with HNPCC diagnosed by the Amsterdam II criteria or within high probability group, appropriate recommendations concerning prophylactic measures, surveillance and treatment were elaborated and transmitted in written form.","Every year in Latvia approximately 900 new colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed. During our study period we have collected cancer family histories from about 30% of the total number of cases. The initial intention was to collect cancer family histories from all consecutive cases in the principal oncology hospitals of Latvia, but due to a variety of different reasons (patient's refusals, limited capacities of research group etc.) this was not possible.Our group of colorectal cancer patients is, however, comparable to the total group of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients as far as age, gender, nationality, place of residence and clinical stage are concerned. Therefore our colorectal cancer group can be considered as representative for all newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients in Latvia and can be used in pilot epidemiological studies. On the basis of 865 cancer family histories the incidence of HNPCC in the population of Latvia is somewhere between 0.5-2% of all colorectal cancers. According to several other studies, the incidence of HNPCC varies considerably from 1% to 10% of all colorectal cancers in different populations and ethnic groups [6, 9, 14–19]. It appears that clinical incidence of HNPCC in Latvia is one of the lowest reported. This estimate is supported by molecular evidence where two MSH2 and only one of each MLH1/MSH6 mutations were detected. There is no data available about the incidence of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes in neighboring countries like Estonia and Lithuania. However there are published data on 3 and 6 families, respectively, which fulfills the Amsterdam II criteria or suspected HNPCC criteria from Estonia and Lithuania. In 2 Lithuanian families and one Estonian family mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 genes were detected [5]. Results of a prospective multicenter epidemiological study of HNPCC in Finland reveals that the frequency of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is between 0.7-2.4%, which is very similar to the frequency observed in our study [20].Unfortunately, we cannot exclude bias related to the poor reliability of collected pedigree information. Many families have small numbers of relatives and they have very poor medical information about one another for several different historical reasons.None of the first four mutations identified in the Latvian population were similar to the founder mutations identified in Lithuania or Poland [5], however, the number of mutations currently detected does not allow for any ultimate conclusion.In Table 2 the mutation rate and clinical HNPCC detection rate in specific age groups is presented. From 4 mutations 2 were identified in probands in an age group between 30-39 years, which corresponds to a younger age of HNPCC diagnosis [21]. The only HNPCC family (with rare mutation in MSH2 gene) in Latvia detected by another working group in 1997 was also found through a proband with a CRC diagnosed at the age of 34. According to the data obtained it is very important to screen actively for hereditary syndromes all colorectal cancer patients in the age group of 30-39 years as the mutation detection rate in our series is relatively high (18.2%).Table 2 Mutation detection rate in specific age rangesFull size table"
4,MUTYH Mutations Do Not Cause HNPCC or Late Onset Familial Colorectal Cancer,"Recently, carriers of biallelic mutations in the base excision repair gene, MUTYH at 1p34.1, have been demonstrated to have a predisposition for multiple adenomas and colorectal cancer (CRC) causing autosomal recessive inherited disease [1]. The gene encodes a glycolase which is involved in repair of DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species generated during aerobic metabolism [2, 3]. In variant forms this ability is reduced [4]. Oxidative damage to DNA can lead to degenerative diseases, aging and cancer [2].Sequence variants in MUTYH are found in different ethnic groups [1]. Two common MUTYH mutations, Y165C and G382D, account for approximately 85% of the mutations occurring in individuals of Caucasian ancestry [1]. Other MUTYH mutations known to be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) are E466X, Y90X and 1395delGGA [1, 5]. Combined data from previous studies suggest that about 1% of colorectal cancer cases can be attributed to biallelic MUTYH mutations [3, 6–8]. Families classified as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Attenuated FAP (AFAP), but without a detected mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene, may be caused by biallelic MUTYH mutations [9].Phenotypic expression of the MUTYH mutation in the heterozygous form is not clear. Kairupan et al. [9] demonstrated that the MUTYH mutations Y165C, G382D and 1395delGGA were not present in the APC mutation-positive FAP population they investigated, suggesting that it does not act as a modifier gene in the development of FAP. The mismatch repair genes also have roles in the removal of oxidative damage [10]. It is demonstrated that the MSH2/MSH6 complex is physically associated with MUTYH at an MSH6 binding site and is required to stimulate MUTYH activity [10, 11]. Disruption of the MSH2/MSH6 complex causes HNPCC, and it has been reported that MUTYH mutations are associated with colorectal cancer risk and can be associated with the clinical features of HNPCC [9, 12]. Kambara et al. [8] suggest that MUTYH variation does not initiate progression of cancer, but acts as a promoter in a subset of CRCs. Croitoru et al. [13] demonstrated that heterozygous mutations in Y165C and G382D may confer a potentially important low-penetrant risk of CRC.A number of families fit the clinical criteria for FAP, AFAP, HNPCC or appear to be inherited, but mutations in known genes have not yet been found. About 30% of FAP cases are apparently ""sporadic"" (new mutations) giving a one in two risk to their offspring, but low risk to their siblings. If these cases are caused by MUTYH mutations and recessive inheritance, the risk to siblings is one in four and the risk to offspring is low in small sibships. The findings have clinical implications for the families as to evaluating the risk of developing cancer and mode of surveillance.Many questions remain unanswered concerning MUTYH. We have addressed the following: 1) Do biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers invariably demonstrate FAP? 2) May MUTYH be a gene causing HNPCC, HNPCC-like or dominantly inherited late onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC)?Previously [14, 15] we have identified a number of families with aggregation of CRCs and/or colorectal polyps. We have used the tools available to identify known CRC syndromes in these families, but in a majority no definite cause has been demonstrated. We here report the results of screening these families for MUTYH mutations.","The patients included in the study had been referred to the Section of Genetic Counselling at the Norwegian Radium Hospital. They were included and classified according to their family history of colorectal and other cancers applying wide clinical criteria [16]. The family history was expanded and information on the site and classification of cancers and polyps and age at diagnosis were obtained and verified in the medical files and/or in the National Cancer Registry whenever possible.We examined affecteds from our total series of HNPCC, HNPCC-like and LOCRC kindreds demonstrated not to have any MMR mutations. Blood samples from 96 patients diagnosed with either cancer and/or tubular adenomas were examined. Thirty-one belonged to HNPCC families, i.e. they met the Amsterdam criteria II [17]; 43 were HNPCC-like, i.e. they almost met the Amsterdam criteria II and/or had cases with multiple primaries; and 22 belonged to families with LOCRC, i.e. presence in the family of four or more HNPCC-related cancers all diagnosed over 50 years of age [18]. Sixty-three index persons had at least one cancer and 33 index persons had one or more adenomas. Median age of first tumour was 49 years (23-78) for colorectal cancers (n = 53), 49 years (29-76) for tubular adenomas (n = 33), 54 years (44-62) for endometrial cancers (n = 4) and 57 years (39-69) for other cancers (n = 6).Tumours from eighty-five affecteds had been subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 gene products using standard procedures [14, 15, 19, 20]. Blood samples from all patients demonstrating lack of gene product in tumour by IHC (n = 66) had been subjected to sequencing of the corresponding gene and searching for large rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 [14, 15, 21].All blood samples were subjected to sequencing of exon 7 (Y165C) and exon 13 (G382D) in the MUTYH gene with PCR reactions as previously described [6]. DNA sequencing was performed using a DYEnamic ET dye terminator cycle sequencing kit on a MegaBACE™1000 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden).The medical files verifying diagnoses were obtained with written permission from living persons, or with permission from descendants of the dead ones. Written informed consent was underlying all requests for tumour specimens. If the patient was dead, the living relative(s) at risk consented. For mutation analyses, informed consent was obtained in writing following genetic counselling. Because all activity reported was approved health care, all information was kept in our medical files.","Two heterozygotes for the European founder mutations were found:


one patient was heterozygous for G382D. She had an ovarian cancer at the age of 69 and one colon adenoma. Her daughter had three tubular adenomas 48 years old, three tubular adenomas 49 years old and one at the age of 56, but a blood sample was not available. The family had been classified as HNPCC-like. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins of the patient's ovarian cancer showed presence of all three proteins and mutation analyses for MMR genes were not undertaken;


the other patient was heterozygous for Y165C. He had two tubular adenomas at the age of 49 and a hypophyseal adenoma at 50. His two siblings had not had cancers or adenomas. His mother had CRC at 40 years, and endometrial cancer at 50. She developed duodenal and jejunal polyps demonstrated to include two invasive cancers, and was demonstrated to be homozygous for Y165C. Her sister had contracted CRC at 42. The family had been classified as close to the Amsterdam criteria II [17].


","In our series, selected to have dominantly inherited colorectal cancer, or suspected to have, we found no excess of MUTYH mutations. We concluded that the clustering of colorectal cancers in the families was not caused by MUTYH mutations.The prevalence of MUTYH mutations in the series examined was 2/96 = 2%, which is not more than expected by chance alone. Both mutation carriers were selected because of presence of adenomas, which consequently could not be included in the analysis of the mutation carriers. The major clinical findings were, however, that one of the patients had ovarian cancer and the other a hypophyseal adenoma. In addition, the latter had a homozygous mother with HNPCC-like phenotype including endometrial carcinoma, who later in life presented with AFAP-like disease. None of the findings indicated that MUTYH might cause dominantly inherited HNPCC or LOCRC, and none of the families included relatives with FAP.Other studies have shown 1.35-1.67% Y165C and G382D mutations in a control population [9, 12, 13], 1.6% in HNPCC patients [12] and 2-2.34% in CRC patients [7, 13]. The numbers are probably underestimated since the mutation screening methods do not detect all disease-causing sequence changes. The carrier frequency in British and North American populations has been estimated to be 2% [4, 22].In the first reports on homozygous for MUTYH mutations having colorectal cancer, patients were selected on the basis of having multiple polyps (AFAP). The two heterozygous mutation carriers and also the homozygous mutation carrier in our study only had a few adenomas. Others have also shown that heterozygous and homozygous mutation carriers are not consistent with multiple adenomatous polyps [6, 7, 12, 13, 23]. It seems like homozygous for MUTYH mutations may present AFAP, but they do not invariably do so.The homozygous (Y165C/Y165C) mutation carrier did not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAP, but developed duodenal and jejunal polyps. This is keeping with other reports: [12, 13]. Nielsen et al. [24] revealed several cases of gastro-duodenal polyps in homozygous mutation carriers in MUTYH-associated polyposis coli and Kairupan et al. [9] reported one patient with a duodenal polyp.Farrington et al. [23] demonstrated that heterozygous mutations predispose to CRC later in life, but the effect was small and of borderline significance. Croitoru et al. [13] reported that heterozygous MUTYH mutations (Y165C and G382D) may confer a potentially important low-penetrance risk of CRC. Such reports should be interpreted with caution, because when an MUTYH mutation is found in a colorectal cancer kindred, half of the affected relatives are expected to have the same mutation. One might have expected more reports if the positive finding were true. It is possible that negative findings have not been reported. None of our LOCRC families demonstrated MUTYH mutations.In conclusion, our findings were in keeping with our interpretation of the literature: homozygous carriers of MUTYH mutations are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. They may present FAP or AFAP, but they do not invariably do so. Heterozygous carriers of MUTYH mutations may or may not have slightly increased risk of colorectal cancer, but they do not explain the occurrence of familial colorectal cancer in the population. From a practical clinical genetic point of view, MUTYH mutations cause a rare autosomally recessively inherited disorder characterized by colorectal and duodenal cancers."
5,The development of a colorectal cancer surgery core outcome set,"Systematic reviews of colorectal cancer surgical trials demonstrate significant heterogeneity of outcome measurement and evidence for selective outcome reporting. This weakens evidence synthesis by hindering meta-analyses, and undermines trial results through outcome reporting bias. This study developed a “core set” of outcomes to be used in trials of colorectal cancer surgery to minimise these limitations.","All potential outcomes were identified through systematic literature reviews and interviews with patients. Similar outcomes were grouped into domains and operationalized into a questionnaire survey. Delphi consensus methodology was used to gain agreement between patients, surgeons and nurses as to which outcome domains were “core”. Stakeholders completed questionnaires which asked them to rate the importance of domains on a scale of 1 (not essential) to 9 (absolutely essential). Responses were analysed by retaining outcomes rated between 7-9 by over 50% of respondents and 1-3 by less than 15%. Domains not meeting the pre-defined criteria were discarded after each Delphi round. Domains retained after the second round were brought forward into separate stakeholder meetings to agree on the final core set.","Data sources identified 1216 outcomes of colorectal cancer surgery that were grouped into 116 domains. A total of 81 UK colorectal cancer centres were surveyed (response rate 79%), including 93 surgeons and 11 clinical nurse specialists, and 97 patients (response rate 36%). 51 outcome domains were retained following the first Delphi survey, and 23 were brought forward to the consensus meetings. Nine outcome domains were considered essential by both stakeholder consensus groups including oncological (long-term survival; cancer recurrence; resection margins), operative (peri-operative survival, surgical site infection, conversion to open surgery (where appropriate), stoma rates and complications) and quality of life (physical and sexual functioning, faecal incontinence and urgency) outcomes.","This study has developed an evidence-based, internationally ratified core outcome set for colorectal cancer surgery. It is recommended that these outcomes be incorporated into future clinical trials."
6,"Optimal use of antiplatelet agents, especially aspirin, in the perioperative management of colorectal cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection","The recent developments in science and technology have improved the life span and quality of life of the ageing population with disorders. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents are used to prevent cardiovascular events in those with cardiovascular complications. The use of perioperative antithrombotic therapy (ATT) for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular complications during abdominal surgery significantly affects the incidence of intra- and postoperative bleeding complications (BC) or thromboembolic complications (TC). In particular, discontinuing antiplatelet therapy (APT) during the perioperative period increases the risk of TC. Moreover, intra- or postoperative BC may occur more often when APT is continued before or during surgery.Laparoscopic surgery is an established procedure and a standard operative approach in many general surgeries. Although laparoscopic abdominal surgery has been suggested to be superior to conventional open surgery, the efficacy and safety outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer are still unclear. In particular, the safety of laparoscopic abdominal surgery in patients taking antiplatelet drugs for cardiovascular disorders is not guaranteed. No study has examined the safety of perioperative APT in laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer.This study aimed to review and evaluate the surgical outcomes, particularly perioperative BC and TC under APT, of colorectal cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection.","Between January 2005 and December 2015, 5202 abdominal gastroenterological surgical procedures were performed at our institution. Among them, 578 radical laparoscopic colorectal surgeries were performed for colorectal cancer patients, and these cases were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were included: histologically diagnosed colorectal cancer, tumour located in the caecum–rectum (Rb), T1–T3 or T4 without involvement to other organs, N0-3 node stage, and M0 metastasis stage. Cases of emergency surgery, laparoscopic surgery later converted to open surgery, and those with insufficient information in the medical records were excluded.The patients were divided into three groups according to the risk for theromboembolism. Obesity, smoking, old age, history of thromboembolic disease and predisposition, in particular, based on the presence or absence of ATT for heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were the risk factors. Since we focused on APT this time, so we handled anticoagulant therapy (ACT) as described later. Preoperative use of ATT (APT and/or ACT) was as shown in Fig. 1. APT was performed in 168 cases (29.1%) out of 578 cases. The antiplatelet agent is considered to be at high risk for thromboembolism with discontinuation, and the patient with antiplatelet agent was judged to be at risk. We defined the group with both low risk of thromboembolism and without an antiplatelet agent as the non-APT group (n = 410). Patients with the following characteristics were considered to have high thromboembolic risks: (1) undergoing drug-eluting coronary stent (DES) implantation regardless of the interval between DES implantation and surgical procedures, (2) underwent drug-noneluting coronary bare-metal stent implantation within 2 months, (3) undergoing cerebrovascular reconstruction within 2 months, (4) recent cerebral stroke or transient ischemic attack, and (5) patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases who were assessed by cardiac or cerebral specialists to have a “high risk” for thromboembolism for other reasons. In such group, the patients at high risk for thromboembolism who had maintained at least one antiplatelet drug, usually aspirin 100 mg, on the day before surgery were classified into the APT-HR group (n = 54). About 1–2 days after confirming postoperative haemostasis, they restarted APT as soon as possible. Meanwhile, patients with low risk for thromboembolism (except both non-APT and APT-HR) in whom APT was discontinued 1 week before surgery and resumed as soon as possible after confirming haemostasis postoperative, mostly 1–2 days, were classified into the APT-LR group (n = 114). If patients were on long-term oral ACT, mainly warfarin, then the drug is discontinued 5 to 7 days before surgery, bridging ACT with unfractionated heparin and early postoperative reinstitution. In patients using both APT and oral ACT, perioperative management of APT was coupled with that of ACT.Fig. 1Preoperative use of ATT (APT and ACT). ASA, aspirin; TPs, thienopyridines (ticlopidine or clopidogrel)Full size imagePostoperative complications were categorised and assessed using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC), and CDC class II or higher was considered to have postoperative complications. Operative mortality was defined as death within 30 days postoperative. The primary outcomes included both BC and TC. The perioperative and outcome variables of the APT-HR and APT-LR groups were compared with those of the non-APT group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the risk factors for intra- and postoperative BC and TC.Data in each group were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact probability test. Continuous variables in the patient characteristics were expressed as a median with range and compared via one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test. Nonparametric variables were also compared using Kruskal-Wallis test with Scheffe’s F test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Data were analysed using the SPSS package software (Ver. 20).","A total of 168 patients (29.1%) used APT in this cohort. The APT-HR, APT-LR, and non-APT groups included 54 (9.3%), 114 (19.7%), and 410 (70.9%) patients, respectively. In the APT group, single APT was the most frequently used [n = 121 (72%)], whereas “strong” dual APT was used in 47 (28%) patients.Table 1 shows the preoperative characteristics of patients in each group. The APT-HR and APT-LR groups had more patients with chronic heart failure, a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and CI, poor cardiac conditions, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or higher heart failure, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III or higher systemic disease, regular haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and history of DM treatment. A total of 91 patients were treated via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 33 were treated via PCI with DES. The number of patients with a history of PCI and DES treatment was higher in the APT group than in the non-APT group.Table 1 Preoperative characteristics of patients in the cohortFull size tableIntraoperative characteristics in each group are detailed in Table 2.Table 2 Intraoperative characteristics of patients in the cohortFull size tableNo significant difference was found in operation methods (p = 0.058), resection in the rectum or not (p = 0.225). The postoperative patient characteristics and morbidity and mortality in the cohort are summarised in Table 3. Blood loss during operation (p = 0.304), operative time (p = 0.956), hospitalisation after surgery (p = 0.307), and CDC of surgery-related complications (p = 0.467) were not significantly different among the three groups. No patient had uncontrollable excessive intraoperative bleeding due to continuation of APT, although the estimated amount of operative blood loss was identical between the groups.Table 3 Postoperative characteristics and morbidity and mortality of patients in the cohortFull size tablePostoperative complications developed in 9.3% of all patients. In terms of postoperative morbidity, only seven (1.2%) cases of BC (six anastomotic regions and one rectal ulcer) were noted. Of these, one case each belonged to the APT-HR and APT-LR groups, and the rest were in the non-APT group. Meanwhile, four (0.7%) cases of TC [two CI, one PTE, and one deep vein thrombosis (DVT)] and 43 cases (7.4%) of other surgical complications were noted. Thrombus formation occurred in four patients: two CI cases in the APT-LR group and PE and DVT in the non-APT group. TC was not noted in the APT-HR group. In the APT groups, no significant differences were found in the occurrence of postoperative BC (p = 0.864) and TC (p = 0.287). Moreover, the occurrences of postoperative luminal bleeding (p = 0.864), PTE (p = 0.814), CI (p = 0.663), and DVT (p = 0.814) were not significantly different among the three groups. The most common complications in all the groups were superficial surgical site infection (1.6%), anastomotic leakage (2.9%), and small bowel obstruction (1.7%). Among them, the incidence of small bowel obstruction was the highest in the APT-HR group (p = 0.038). Nevertheless, the complication rate in the APT-HR group is significantly increased (p < 0.0001). No operative mortality occurred in the APT-HR, APT-LR, and non-APT groups.Detailed data on postoperative BC and TC are shown in Table 4. In terms of BC, only luminal bleeding was noted. Emergent colonoscopy was performed for postoperative haemorrhage in one APT-HR and one APT-LR cases undergoing laparoscopic anterior resection, but the bleeding was managed. Of five cases of BC in the non-APT group, one case of the rectal ulcer was conservative. Two cases in which the rectum was anastomosed in a low degree were managed by suturing from an anal approach on the day of rectal resection under general anaesthesia. No postoperative bleeding due to resumption of APT administration was noted. In terms of TC, APT was resumed in one case that included preoperative basilar artery stenosis, but CI due to acute basilar artery occlusion developed after an operation and outside decompression procedure was performed. The patient recovered eventually. The other case that included Paf resumed ACT and APT after surgery, but arteria basilaris acute occlusion developed on the same day when APT was started. The patient was managed through absorption of the thrombus via a catheter and was saved. The PTE was accidentally discovered via preoperative CT examination, and the thrombus completely disappeared with preoperative heparin administration. During postoperative urination, she went into shock because of fresh and extensive PTE in the right main pulmonary artery; immediately most of the thrombi were absorbed with a catheter. The other DVT case occurred after surgery, and medical treatment was provided. However, this proved inadequate because the thrombus was refractory; thus, thrombectomy was performed after insertion of an inferior vena cava filter.Table 4 Postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic complications in the cohortFull size tableWe cannot conduct a multivariate analysis, because there are only seven events for BC and only four for TC events. It was suggested that at least cAPT does not contribute to the sharp increase in postoperative BC and TC.s","Myocardial infarction (MI) is among the most important and frequent cardiovascular conditions. Although the mortality rate due to coronary heart disease has declined over the past four years, it is still responsible for one third of all deaths for men aged 35 years and older in Europe [1] and one fifth of all deaths in the USA in 2014 [2]. Along with MI, stroke is a major healthcare problem causing ~ 10% of deaths worldwide [3] and is the leading cause of disability, with 20% of survivors requiring institutional care after 3 months and 15–30% being permanently disabled [4]. Aspirin is beneficial during acute MI and acute ischemic stroke [5, 6] and is effective in the secondary prevention of future cardiovascular events [7]. Aspirin may be proper to survival by attenuating the severity of recurrent thrombosis-mediated events rather than reducing the occurrence of MI [8]. Continuation of aspirin may still be reasonable in patients with high-risk coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, where the risks of potential increased cardiovascular events outweigh the risks of increased bleeding [9].As the number of patients with cardiovascular disease increases in the ageing population, antiplatelets have become among the most frequently prescribed drugs. An increasing percentage of patients referred for surgical treatment have consumed long-term APT, which significantly increases the risk of peri- and postoperative BC [10]; thus, APT is often discontinued during the preoperative period. However, discontinuing APT may increase the risk of TC. Once TC has occurred, the possibility that it will be more severe than BC is high. Hence, the perioperative management protocol for patients receiving APT includes, at least, a single antiplatelet agent (usually aspirin) maintained preoperatively in patients with high thromboembolic risk. Thus, if the risk of BC does not increase with continued APT, proactively continuing APT to prevent TC is reasonable. It is recommended to continue aspirin perioperatively if the bleeding risk allows, and to resume the recommended antiplatelet therapy as soon as possible postoperatively [11]. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that APT during non-cardiac surgery confers minimal bleeding risk with no difference in thrombotic complications [12]. Such a finding has been discussed in the management of perioperative antiplatelet agents, but the conclusions lack evidence. Therefore, balancing the bleeding risks after continuation of APT and thromboembolic risks after cessation of APT during the perioperative period is based on the surgeon’s prerogative.The paradigm in colorectal and general surgery has shifted over the past decade toward increasing the role of minimally invasive approaches. Laparoscopic colon resection was initially described by both Jacobs et al. and Fowler et al. in 1991 [13, 14]. Given that an increasing number of colorectal surgeons use these approaches regularly, laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been established as a safe and superior technique in many general surgery procedures. A Japanese randomised controlled trial reported that laparoscopic D3 surgery was similar to open D3 surgery in terms of overall survival for patients with stage II or III colon cancer. Moreover, laparoscopic D3 surgery can be a treatment option for patients with stage II or III colon cancer [15].The higher the number of laparoscopic surgeries for colorectal cancer, the higher the number of patients with severe complications, such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders. For patients with high risk of ischemia due to ACS presentation or complicated coronary revascularisation procedure, postponing surgery up to 6 months after ACS or PCI may be reasonable as an additional means of protection to minimise the risk of preoperative MI, and based on unmatched retrospective registry data if the risks of further delaying surgery are acceptable. However, in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery after recent ACS or stent implantation, the benefits of early surgery for certain malignant tumours should be balanced against the risk of cardiovascular events. Many patients with these complications are taking APT, and discussion on various effects of APT on laparoscopic colorectal resection is inevitable. The risk of thromboembolism in laparoscopic colorectal surgery was previously reported to increase due to an increase in intraperitoneal pressure caused by pneumoperitoneum [16]. However, the incidence of venous thromboembolism was lower in laparoscopic colorectal surgery than in open surgery [17, 18], and our findings indicate a considerably low rate. We also examined BC and TC in terms of APT use in patients who underwent standardised laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer in our department.In general, the patients subjected to laparoscopic surgery had lesser blood loss, longer operation time, shorter hospital stay, and lower morbidity than those who underwent open surgery [19]. In this study, postoperative morbidity rates (9.3%) for patients with severe complications were also low. In terms of APT, the rate of complications, including BC and TC, was significantly higher in the APT-HR group, but no significant difference was noted among the three groups in terms of both BC and TC. The APT-HR group has been treated for cardiovascular diseases and with concentrated antiplatelet therapy compared to other groups (Table 1), which causes higher complications as suggested. Aside from the two cases of bleeding from a close anastomotic region in the rectum, hospital stay was not prolonged. Bleeding due to continuation of APT was not noted in any patient. All bleeding episodes were successfully managed without an increase in bleeding-related mortality. Moreover, all the four TC cases were not in the APT-HR group. Although the incidence of TC was fewer compared with that of BC, catheterisation was done in two patients, and others were subjected to invasive operation. All patients were managed successfully, but the likelihood of fatal complications, particularly TC, was high. Using perioperative aggressive APT (continuation of single APT up to the day before surgery; cAPT) was not an important factor for both BC and TC. If BC does not increase with cAPT, then this protocol seems to be useful for suppressing fatal TC, even in general surgery such as laparoscopic colorectal surgery.We showed that our perioperative antiplatelet management is safe and effective as evidenced by a low TC and BC rate and that advanced laparoscopic colorectal resection can achieve satisfactory results even under continuation of single APT. As such, using cAPT (usually aspirin) can be recommended for almost all patients with thromboembolic risk who will undergo minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic surgery. This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate the safety of antiplatelet agents in the perioperative management of patients undergoing general laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer. For the optimal management of perioperative APT for various types of diseases and surgical procedures, collecting and analysing more cases are necessary in future studies."
