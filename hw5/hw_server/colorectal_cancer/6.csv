0,Pilot Study on Low Penetrance Breast and Colorectal Cancer Predisposition Markers in Latvia,"There is continuing interest in identifying DNA variants which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Several studies have suggested an increased risk of cancer in individuals who carry a mutation in the CHEK2 gene, one of the genes in the DNA damage signalling pathway. Originally, a single founder allele in CHEK2, 1100delC, was reported to be a low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele in several studies, and in many ethnic groups [1–4]. Then, a positive association was found between CHEK2 variants and prostate cancer in the USA, Finland and Poland [5–7]. Recently, it was reported that individuals with a single common founder allele in Poland (the I157T missense variant) have increased risk of cancer development in many organs including the breast, prostate, thyroid, kidney and colon [8].The NOD2 gene is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's disease [9]. It was reported that a single truncating mutation in NOD2, 3020insC, may confer increased risk of late onset colorectal cancer [10] and then that a NOD2 mutation may be associated with increased susceptibility to lung, ovarian, early-onset laryngeal cancer and early onset breast cancer [11].It has not been established whether CHEK2 and NOD2 variants are present in Latvia and whether inherited variation in these genes influences cancer risk in this population. To address these issues, we report here the results of the CHEK2 and NOD2 analyses for 185 breast cancer cases and 235 colorectal cancer cases.","From 11/2003 to 06/2005 family cancer history and peripheral venous blood samples were collected in 185 consecutive hospital-based breast cancer cases and 235 colorectal cancer cases. The population control group included umbilical cord blood samples from 978 consecutively collected anonymous newborn children between 03/2005 and 08/2005. Cases were considered consecutive if at least 70% of newly diagnosed patients were involved in the study from a particular hospital and department in a given period of time. In the breast cancer group, 82 cases were involved from the Regional Oncology Hospital of Daugavpils, 72 cases from the Regional Oncology Hospital of Liepaja and 31 cases from Paula Stradins University Hospital.In the CRC group, 92 cases were involved from the Oncology Center of Latvia, 73 cases from Paula Stradins University Hospital, 46 cases from the Regional Oncology Hospital of Liepaja and 24 cases from the Regional Oncology Hospital of Daugavpils. In the CRC group 114/235 (49%) were females and 121/235 (51%) were males. The distribution of breast and colorectal cancers according to the age of diagnosis are summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Distribution of breast cancer and CRC group according to age at time of cancer diagnosisFull size tableMedian age of CRC onset was 66 years and median onset of breast cancer was 60 years.In order to evaluate the representativity of breast cancer and CRC groups, they were compared to all newly diagnosed breast and colorectal cancers diagnosed between years 1999 and 2003 in Latvia and it was concluded that breast and CRC groups are comparable to the total group of newly diagnosed breast cancers and CRCs as far as age at time of diagnosis and gender are concerned.All cancer and control group samples were tested for the presence of NOD2 3020insC, CHEK2 I157T polymorphisms as described by G. Kurzawski and C. Cybulski respectively [7–10].The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pauls Stradins University Hospital and the Central Committee of Medical Ethics.All patients completed a family cancer history questionnaire. Family cancer histories were analysed according to internationally approved clinical diagnostic hereditary cancer criteria. If there were no malignancies among relatives of the proband the patient was classified as being negative for a family history of the disease.The prevalence of the CHEK2 and NOD2 alleles in cases and population controls was compared. Odds ratios were generated from two-by-two tables and statistical significance was assessed using the Fisher exact test. The odds ratios were used as estimates of relative risk.","The NOD2 3020insC mutation was present in 7.7% (18/235) of CRC cancers, in 9.2% (17/185) of breast cancer patients and in 7.7% (75/974) of the control group. The CHEK2 I157T polymorphism was found in 7.6% (14/185) of breast cancer patients, 10.2% (24/235) of colon cancer cases and in 6.4% (63/978) of the control group.Statistically significant differences compared to population controls were observed: for NOD2 3020insC for the subgroup of breast cancer patients diagnosed at the age between 51 and 60 (OR = 2.5, p < 0.05) (Table 2); for CHEK2 I157T for the entire series of consecutive colorectal cancers (OR = 1.7, p < 0.05). The highest odds ratio (OR = 2.0, p = 0.06) was observed for CRC diagnosed at age >70 yrs (Table 3).Table 2 Prevalence of NOD2 3020insC mutation in breast cancer patients, according to age at onsetFull size tableTable 3 Prevalence of CHEK2 I157T mutation in colorectal cancer cases according to age at onsetFull size tableIn seven NOD2 3020insC positive cases family cancer history was negative. In another 10 cases there were two other relatives affected with cancer in their families, which did not match any recognised diagnostic criteria of hereditary cancer. A single NOD2 3020insC positive patient had a family history of three CRCs in their family.The average age of cancer onset for breast cancer patients harbouring NOD2 3020insC was 58 years. In six NOD2 3020insC positive breast cancer patients their family cancer history was negative. In 5/17 (29%) cases at least two breast cancers were identified in these families and one family matched the criteria of belonging to unspecified strong cancer family aggregation (CFA).The average age of disease onset for CHEK2 I157T positive CRC cases was 67. In 16 cases with the I157T mutation family cancer history was negative. Among another 8 CHEK2 I157T positive CRC patients, 3/24 (13%) matched criteria of CFA, 1/24 (4%) case was suspected of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and 1/24 (4%) case had late-onset HNPCC.The average age of breast cancer onset for CHEK2 I157T positive cases was 59 years. In four CHEK2 I157T positive breast cancer cases family cancer history was negative. 8/14 (57%) cases had familial breast cancer.","This first study of low penetrant CRC and breast cancer predisposition markers in Latvia shows a trend that both NOD2 3020insC and CHEK2 I157T polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of colorectal and breast cancers.Statistically significant differences between cases and controls were not as well expressed as it has been recognised in earlier studies from Poland, probably because of the much smaller number of cases and controls, but the general trend was the same - NOD2 3020insC was more frequent among early onset breast cancers and late onset CRCs; CHEK2 I157T was in excess among colorectal cancer and late onset breast cancer cases. In our study we focused on breast and colon cancers. Since for both sites we saw a similar trend as described earlier by the Polish group, we expect that the spectrum of tumours associated with mutations in NOD2 and CHEK2 in Latvia will also include other cancers. However, further studies on larger series of cancers and of different sites are necessary in this regard."
1,Metastatic colorectal cancer to a primary thyroid cancer,"Metastatic malignancy to the thyroid gland, although considered rare, occurs more frequently than expected. Microscopic metastases to the thyroid gland have been reported to occur in 4%–9% of autopsy studies[1, 2], with breast, lung, melanoma and kidney the most common primary malignancies. Metastatic colorectal cancer to the thyroid gland is considered unusual, with 33 previous cases reported in the literature up till 2008 [3–6]. There are no previously published reports of metastatic malignancy to a primary thyroid malignancy.","A 52 year old man with a history of T3N1M0 (Dukes C) rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (5FU + radiotherapy) followed by anterior resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (5FU) presented 18 months post completion of therapy with rising serum CEA level (2.3 μg/l post resection of primary rectal malignancy to 9.7 μg/l) and a 15 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule on computerized tomography (CT), suggestive of a metastatic deposit (figure 1). He had no other significant past medical history and no family history of malignancy. Physical examination was unremarkable, with no obvious mass lesions in the abdomen or palpable local recurrence in the rectal stump.Figure 1

Full size imageAn 18F-FDG whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan was performed to further evaluate the nature of the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule and to evaluate any other possible sites of metastatic disease. The whole body PET scan demonstrated significant 18F-FDG uptake in the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule compatible with a metastatic deposit (figure 2). An intensely FDG-avid right lower lobe thyroid nodule was also noted, which corresponded with a large partially calcified well circumscribed nodule on CT.Figure 2

Full size imageAn ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate of the right lower pole thyroid nodule was performed which revealed malignant cells with features suggestive of a primary papillary thyroid cancer. A right hemi-thyroidectomy was subsequently performed. Macroscopically, the resected thyroid specimen demonstrated a well-circumscribed dominant thyroid nodule measuring 32 mm in diameter with a pale tan capsule less than 1 mm in thickness. The cut surface had a variegated appearance with pale tan friable tissue intermixed with foci of yellow tissue and dark brown foci. Histological examination revealed cells typical of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon intermixed in a background of a poorly differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (figure 3).Figure 3

Full size imageA wedge resection of the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule was subsequently performed which confirmed metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (figure 4). Serum CEA level normalized post operatively (1.9 μg/l) and no further surgery was contemplated. Despite no further overt metastatic disease on CT, the patient was commenced on a course of chemotherapy (5 FU/Oxaliplatin) to treat presumed low volume metastatic colorectal disease and thus decrease the risk of developing overt recurrence. No further thyroid cancer specific treatment has been initiated.Figure 4

Full size image","Metastatic lesions to the thyroid gland are generally considered rare, possibly due to a high oxygen and iodine environment which may impair the ability of metastatic cells to settle and develop. Abundant high velocity blood flow through the thyroid gland also possibly plays a role in impeding the ability for metastatic cells to gain a foothold[3]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when primary thyroid pathology occurs which results in structural change, this has been associated with an increased incidence of metastases to the thyroid gland. Multinodular goiters and adenomatous change have both been associated with an increased incidence of metastases to the thyroid gland[7]. It is possible our patient had a pre-existing primary thyroid carcinoma at the time of initial surgery for the primary rectal malignancy which altered the local thyroid environment rendering conditions more favorable for metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma cells to settle.With the advent of improved diagnostic imaging technology such as 18F-FDG PET, an increasing number of incidental cases of metastatic disease to the thyroid gland are likely to be detected. Well differentiated primary thyroid carcinomas such as papillary and follicular carcinomas are generally not 18F-FDG avid on PET scanning and usually only become 18F-FDG avid if they de-differentiate.It has been reported in the literature incidentally PET detected 18F-FDG avid primary thyroid malignancies are generally a more aggressive variant of primary thyroid cancer which harbour a higher rate of unfavourable prognostic factors and are often less well differentiated[8]. In our case, the coexistent focus of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma within a primary poorly differentiated thyroid cancer somewhat complicates the issue, as both tumours are likely to be 18F-FDG avid.To our knowledge there have been no cases of metastatic malignancy within a primary thyroid malignancy reported previously in the literature. As such, there is scant evidence in the literature regarding the most appropriate management strategy for such a patient. Conventional management of a primary thyroid malignancy usually involves total surgical thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy to ablate the thyroid remnant, decrease risk of recurrence and enable adequate follow up using I-131 whole body scintigraphy and stimulated thyroglobulin levels [9–13].In our case, prognosis is more likely to be dependent on the patient's metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma rather than the primary thyroid malignancy. Stage IV metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma portends a poor prognosis, with five year survival rates of between 4%–8%[14, 15]. More specific to our case, in a review of 12 patients with metastatic rectal carcinoma to the thyroid between 1990 to 1993 by Fujita et al [3], in the one patient without metastases to any other organ but the thyroid, survival was just 4 years. Primary early stage non anaplastic thyroid carcinoma even if poorly differentiated has a better prognosis compared to metastatic rectal cancer. Poorly differentiated primary follicular thyroid carcinoma has been reported to have a 5 year survival rate of 63% in a recent published series of 40 patients[16].As a result, the primary treatment focus in our patient was tailored towards treating metastatic rectal carcinoma and less so the primary thyroid malignancy. It is also of note, many poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas are not particularly radioiodine avid and it is quite possible the impact of radioiodine therapy on reducing recurrence rates may be greatly diminished in this setting.",Metastatic rectal carcinoma to the thyroid gland and in particular to a primary thyroid malignancy is uncommon and to our knowledge has not been reported. Prognosis is likely to be more dependent on underlying metastatic disease rather than the primary thyroid malignancy hence primary treatments should be tailored towards treating and controlling metastatic disease and less emphasis placed on the primary thyroid malignancy.
2,Colorectal cancer in hyperplastic polyposis syndrome: In search of the polyp of origin,"Hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (HPS) is a colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition of unknown genetic aetiology that is characterised by the presence of multiple serrated polyps throughout the colon, and an increased risk of having a first-degree relative with CRC [1–3]. Though there is a trend for association between CRC and a higher number of polyps, patients with at least one colonic conventional adenoma have an increased risk of CRC compared to patients without conventional adenoma (odds ratio: 3.6) [2]. HPS was first thought to represent the familial model for the serrated neoplasia pathway, as an analogy to the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome for the adenoma-carcinoma pathway. However, CRC in HPS patients appears to arise from both conventional adenomas and serrated polyp subtypes. To further define the carcinogenesis of HPS related colorectal neoplasia, we sought to characterise the histological features and the molecular alterations of the different types of benign polyps arising in HPS patients both in contiguity with and remote from CRC.","A total of 151 patients diagnosed with at least 5 serrated polyps outside the rectum were recruited from high-risk genetics clinics. Polyp counts were extracted from colonoscopy reports. Polyps, including contiguous polyps, and CRCs underwent pathology review and testing for KRAS codon 12 and 13 and BRAF V600E somatic mutations.","CRC was identified in 56 patients (37%) with 31/56 (55%) being females. The mean polyp count in patients with CRC was 58, and their mean age was 52 years. A total of 65 CRCs were available for analysis. Where site was known, most CRCs 43/61 (71%) arose in the proximal colon; however, only 19/58 (33%) of CRCs demonstrated a BRAF V600E mutation. Somatic KRAS mutations were less frequent at 9/48 (19%). Contiguous polyp was seen in 16/53 (30%) evaluable CRCs, and of these 4 (25%) were tubular adenomas, 5 (31%) were tubulo-villous adenomas and 1 (6%) was a villous adenoma. Overall 10/16 (63%) showed conventional adenomatous morphology whereas 6/16 (37%) had serrated morphology. BRAF mutation was present in 5/16 (31%). CRC was present in more than one-third of clinic-based individuals who presented with multiple serrated polyps.","Despite a high serrated polyp count, only one-third of these CRCs demonstrated a BRAF V600E mutation, the molecular hallmark of the serrated neoplasia pathway, suggesting that though multiple serrated polyps act as a marker of an abnormal mucosa, the majority of CRC in these patients may arise through other mechanisms."
3,Attitudes towards colorectal cancer screening in Lynch syndrome families: how do they change from pre-test genetic counseling to 6 and 12-months post-disclosure?,"Adherence to colonoscopy recommendations can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the use of colonoscopy among persons at risk for Lynch syndrome prior to clinical genetic testing (CGT) and how notification of mutation carrier status affects screening behaviors. The goal of this study was to evaluate colonoscopy use and attitudes towards CRC screening among unaffected relatives of Lynch syndrome mutation carriers before pre-test genetic counseling (baseline) and 6 and 12 months after disclosure of the test results. The primary outcomes of interest were colonoscopy utilization, commitment to screening for colonoscopy, self-efficacy regarding screening adherence, and the benefits, barriers, and efficacy of CRC screening.","110 unaffected relatives completed a psychosocial questionnaire prior to pre-test counseling, 81 had GCT and received test results, and 78 subsequently completed follow-up questionnaires at 6 and 12 months post-results disclosure (52 were mutation negative and 26 were mutation positive). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate group comparisons in change over time. In addition to the main effects of mutation status and time, the time by mutation interactions were included as fixed effects in the model to test for differences in average rate of change over time between the two mutation groups.","While both groups were similar at baseline, after disclosure of results, a significantly greater number of those with a positive test result had a colonoscopy compared with persons who tested negative where colonoscopy utilization decreased significantly (Figure 1).Figure 1Percent Colonoscopy at Baseline and 6 and 12 Months after Disclosure of Lynch Syndrome Genetic Test ResultsFull size image
Analysis showed a significant positive movement through the stages of readiness to have colonoscopy in the mutation-positive group from baseline to 6 and 12 month post-disclosure compared to a significant negative movement through the stages of readiness in the mutation negative group (Table 1). Analysis showed a significant increase in self-efficacy and benefits of CRC screening in the mutation-positive group from baseline to 6 and 12 month post-disclosure and no difference in the mutation-negative group. There was a significant decrease in barriers to CRC screening in the mutation-positive group from baseline to 6 and 12 month post-disclosure and no difference in the mutation-negative group (Table 1).Table 1 Comparison of psychosocial measures by test result at baseline, 6 months post-results disclosure, and 12 months post-results disclosure (n=78)Full size table
","Our results show that CGT may motivate mutation carriers to have a colonoscopy after receiving test results and may also have an impact on their longer-term screening behaviors. In addition, CGT may have a positive impact on mutation carriers’ attitudes towards CRC screening."
4,Racial differences in a high-risk colorectal cancer referral population: a single-center experience,"Multiple studies have shown that colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities exist between African Americans and Caucasians. African Americans have higher CRC incidence and mortality than Caucasians [1, 2]. Furthermore, African Americans present with more advanced CRC [3] and at younger ages [4]. However, little is known about the impact of hereditary CRC syndromes in African Americans on these disparities. In the University of Chicago Cancer Risk Clinic, we see a diverse referral population for evaluation of hereditary syndromes based on personal or family history of CRC. We sought to compare clinical characteristics of our African American and Caucasian patients to determine if differences exist in a high-risk CRC referral population.","We retrospectively collected data on self-reported African American and Caucasian individuals who were referred for a personal or family history of CRC from 1992-2010. Available clinical characteristics including number of individuals, number of families (probands with family members who followed-up in our clinic), personal or family history of CRC, age at cancer onset, and number of individuals who underwent genetic testing for APC or mismatch repair genes were collected. Pedigrees were reviewed to determine Revised Bethesda, Amsterdam II and PREMM1,2 scores. Statistical analysis included Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-square for categorical variables. Comparison of independent proportions was done using z-ratios.","A total of 949 Caucasian and 254 African American individuals were referred to the Cancer Risk Clinic for a personal or family history of CRC. The average age of CRC diagnosis, number of family members with CRC, and those meeting Bethesda and Amsterdam criteria were similar between populations (Table 1). Fewer family members of African American probands were seen compared to Caucasians (p =0.002). More African American females with CRC were seen in our clinic (p=0.04). Importantly, despite overall similar clinical characteristics, fewer African Americans had genetic testing compared to Caucasians (p = 0.02).Table 1 Clinical characteristics of individuals referred for personal and/or family history of CRC by raceFull size table
","Despite many similarities between our high-risk CRC populations, there exists a difference in the number of family members of African American probands seen in our clinic and the number of African Americans who had genetic testing when compared to Caucasians. Less genetic testing may mean African American mutation carriers are not being identified. This can significantly impact appropriate cancer screening recommendations and knowledge about hereditary CRC syndromes in this population. Future collaborative studies are needed to address why these differences may exist."
