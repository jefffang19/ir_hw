0,Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer: barriers to and facilitators of screening and disease management,Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which confirmed carriers of a gene mutation are at high risk for colorectal (CRC) and extracolonic cancers. The purpose of the current study was to develop a greater understanding of the factors influencing the decision-making of confirmed HNPCC carriers post-genetic testing about screening and disease management.,The study used a grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis as part of a multiphase project examining the psychosocial and behavioral impact of genetic counselling and DNA testing for HNPCC on individuals in high risk families with the MSH2 intron 5 splice site mutation or exon 8 deletion. The data from confirmed carriers (n=23) were subjected to re-analysis for the purpose of identifying key barriers to and/or facilitators of effective screening and disease management.,"Thematic analysis identified personal, health care provider and health care system as the dominant barriers to and facilitators of screening and disease management. Person-centered barriers/facilitators included (1) risk perceptions and decision-making and, (2) enduring screening/disease management. Provider barriers/facilitators were defined in terms of participant perceptions of physician awareness of the family history of HNPCC, knowledge of the disease and recommended screening/treatment protocols, and clinical management skills. The health care system barriers/facilitators were defined in terms of continuity of care and coordination of services among different providers.","Individuals at high risk for HPNCC-related cancers often encounter multiple barriers to and facilitators of screening and disease management that go beyond the individual and family to the provider and health care system levels. The current organization and implementation of health care services for clients who are at high genetic risk of developing cancer is inadequate. A coordinated system of local services capable of providing integrated, efficient health care and follow-up, populated by health care providers with knowledge of inherited cancer, is necessary to maintain optimal health in these families."
1,Clinicopathologic and genetic features of young patients with colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer in Canada, often occurring at older ages. While early-onset CRC can be suggestive of an inherited syndrome, the underlying genetic cause remains unexplained in many of these young individuals.","Clinicopathologic features along with genetic and family information were collected on individuals diagnosed with CRC ≤35 years old identified through the Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry in Toronto, Canada.","441 individuals from 353 families were identified, and to-date, medical records confirmed 254 diagnoses, which were included for analysis. Ninety patients (35.4%) had germline mutations in self or kin (31 MSH2, 36 MLHI, 1 MSH6, 3 PMS2, 24 APC, 2 MYH biallelic and 1 BRCA2). Individuals were classified into six categories; (a) 74 had Lynch syndrome (LS) confirmed by germline mutation or tumour deficiency (b) 4 had constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency (CMMR-D) (c) 61 had polyposis (mutation positive, >25 adenomas or hamartomatous polyps), (d) 6 met Family X criteria, (e) 7 had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and (f) 102 were unclassified (NOS), with 69 of these individuals having MSS and/or IHC intact tumours.On average, patients with CMMR-D presented younger, with a mean age of 14 years old at diagnosis. 65.2% of patients with LS presented with a proximal tumour (65.2%) compared with the polyposis (10.2%) and NOS (34.4%) groups. In contrast, 83% of polyposis patients and 65.5% of NOS patients presented with distal colon or rectal cancers.Family history was significant for the majority of LS patients with 54 of 73 (74%) meeting Amsterdam I or II criteria. Two of the 7 patients with IBD, and 15 of 98 NOS patients also met Amsterdam I/II criteria, as opposed to the CMMR-D families where none met these criteria. Six LS patients presented with sporadic CRC, as did approximately 25% of polyposis patients and 59.2% of the NOS patients.","Cancer site differs between individuals ≤35 years with LS, polyposis and NOS CRC. Greater than 1/3 of patients presented with no significant family history of CRC. While the majority of patients diagnosed with CRC ≤35 have a known hereditary CRC syndrome or risk predisposition, 69 of 221 (31.2%) of individuals appear to have no recognizable syndrome."
2,CT texture analysis as a prognostic marker in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab,"Following anti-angiogenic treatment, response might be represented by changes in tumour heterogeneity and may not be reflected on traditional size-based criteria. CT texture analysis (CTTA) is one emerging tool to quantify tumour heterogeneity, and has been shown to be prognostic in different tumour applications. We aimed to assess the association of CTTA with overall survival (OS) in a series of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with bevacizumab.","We retrospectively gathered clinical and imaging data from mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 3 centres in the UK. CTTA comprised the image filtration-histogram technique using commercially available TexRAD research software platform (TexRAD ltd http://www.texrad.com, part of Feedback Plc).","101 patients were identified, of which 67 patients had both pre-treatment and first post-treatment CT scans available for image analysis and response evaluation. 38 patients were treated in first line, 29 in latter lines. Median OS was 12.4 months. Several texture parameters were significantly associated with OS at pre- and post-treatment scans, including mean (p=0.001), mean of positive pixels (p=0.002), entropy (p=0.001) and kurtosis (p=0.004). Furthermore change in entropy between post- and pre-treatment scans was significantly associated with OS (p=0.009) with an increase in post-treatment entropy (>0.1) associated with worse outcome. Particularly post-treatment entropy > 4.51 was the best univariate marker of survival (HR: 3.0, 95% CI = 1.5-5.9, p=0.001).",This retrospective study highlighted the potential of CTTA to be a prognostic marker in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
3,Increased migration of colorectal cancer cells induced by TNF-alpha-treated stromal fibroblasts from human liver metastases,"Inflammation plays key roles in invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Given the multifaceted roles of tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in these processes, its effects on the stromal fibroblasts that constitute the desmoplastic stroma in colorectal metastases are of interest.","Primary cultures of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) were generated from human tissues harvested during hepatic resection. TNF-alpha expression in tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry. Activation of nuclear-factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity was measured by gel mobility shift assay. The effect of TNF-alpha on migratory capacity and gene expression of CAFs was tested in presence/absence of parthenolide, an herbal inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Gene expression in tissues and cell cultures was examined by Northern blot analysis. Protein measurements in the cell culture supernatant were performed with cytometric capture beads.","The colorectal metastases display immunoreactivity for TNF-alpha in tumor cells and leukocyte cells, whereas stromal fibroblasts are negative. To investigate transcriptional effects of TNF-alpha on CAFs, we analysed the expression of potential inflammatory target genes that are involved in tumor progression. CAFs that were exposed for 24 hours to TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) showed a dramatic increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte-chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Increasing concentrations of parthenolide (1, 5, 10 microM) dose-dependently inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha exposure for 30 min, as well as the TNF-alpha effect on IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression. Exposure of CAFs with TNF-alpha significantly increased the chemotaxis of HT29 colon carcinoma cells towards these cells in a coculture migration chamber system. This migratory effect activated by paracrine TNF-alpha was inhibited by co-incubation with parthenolide.",CAFs are an important target for inflammatory signaling mediated by TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB in the context of tumor-stroma interaction and may play an important role in metastasis progression. Our results suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation may be an interesting strategy in antitumor therapy targeting hepatic colorectal carcinoma metastatis.
4,Quality control in colorectal cancer screening: Systematic microbiological investigation of endoscopes used in the NORCCAP (Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention) trial,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of personal suffering and death in the developed world. Screening for CRC by gastrointestinal endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) has been recommended for the average-risk population [1], and is currently implemented in many Western countries. For the time being, endoscopes commonly used for diagnostic and therapeutic as well as for CRC screening purposes, are reusable tools. The endoscopes have to be cleaned manually and/or by using washing machines especially designed for this purpose [2]. The design and material of the endoscopes do not allow sterilisation. Cleaning and disinfection of the devices has been a subject of concern, as transmission of infectious material cannot be entirely dismissed [3]. In 2002, the New York Times reported on the possible transmission of Pseudomonas infection to 400 patients after examination with bronchoscopes that were not adequately designed to ensure proper cleansing and disinfection [4]. Only most recently, outbreaks of bacterial infection associated with flexible bronchoscopes have been confirmed [5, 6]. In a multicentre trial in Germany bacterial growth was found in 49% of cleaned endoscopes, and inadequate cleaning facilities and/or routines were found in more than 50% of endocopy centres [7].According to current WHO guidelines, all screening tests should be designed to ensure that the test itself does not cause any harm to screenees. Substantial efforts should therefore be made to minimize any risk of contamination of endoscopes. This is especially important in CRC screening where presumptively healthy individuals are exposed to endoscopy.NORCCAP is a large-scale randomized controlled trial for CRC prevention by flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS). Twenty-one thousand individuals, age 50–64 years, were randomly drawn from the Norwegian Population Registry and invited to an FS screening examination [8]. Screening was performed between 1999 and 2001 at two centres in South East Norway. As part of a continuous quality control programme in the NORCCAP trial, microbiological samples were systematically taken from cleaned endoscopes throughout the trial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of cleaning of endoscopes used in CRC screening.","During the 2-year study period, 8573 examinations were performed (3798 at centre I, 4775 at centre II). One hundred and seventy eight samples (2% of 8573) were taken for microbiological investigation.Bacterial growth was observed in 16 out of 107 (15%) samples from the biopsy channels and in 10 out of 71 (14%) samples from the endoscope surface. At centre I, we observed growth in 7 out of 41 biopsy channel samples (17%), and in 3 out of 35 (9%) surface samples. At centre II, 9 out of 66 (14%) samples from the biopsy channel and 7 out of 36 (19%) surface samples showed bacterial contamination. One sample (at centre I) showed growth of Enterobacter cloacae, indicating faecal contamination. This endoscope was re-tested after two weeks without any findings of contamination. The other bacteria found were low- or non-virulent species of the environment:• Staphylococcus epidermidis in 8 biopsy channel samples and 7 surface samples• Micrococci in 2 biopsy channel samples and 3 surface samples• Bacillus sp. in 3 biopsy channel samples• Pseudomonas stutzeri in 1 biopsy channel sample• Weeksella virosa in 1 biopsy channel sample","Also after cleaning and disinfection adhering to current guidelines [2], a considerable number of microbiological samples taken from cleaned ready-to-use endoscopes showed bacterial growth. The vast majority of microbes found were environmental bacteria. In one out of 178 samples (0.5%), however, Enterobacter cloacae was found, indicating faecal contamination of the endoscope. We did not search for any viruses or Mycobacteria in the present trial. However, the finding of faecal bacteria is an indicator for other pathogenic organisms potentially present in that particular endoscope. In a recent study on Helicobacter pylori contamination of gastroscopes, the authors report on one contamination out of 128 samples of manually cleaned endoscopes [11].Our results show that the risk of transmission of infections by endoscopy is real, but probably small when following current cleaning guidelines and using endoscope washing machines. Continuous microbiological investigation of endoscopes should be performed in any CRC screening programme. After the finding of enterobacteria in one of our endoscopes, we improved the cleaning process by adding a detergent solution to the tap water used for flushing the biopsy channel by suction immediately after each endoscopy procedure, to destroy any debris or biofilm containing microorganisms. This procedure is recommended in the ESGE guidelines [2], but is not common practice in Norway.Additionally, we started rinsing the biopsy channels of all endoscopes with alcohol at the end of each session, to improve the drying of the inner surfaces. This procedure is additional to the cleaning and disinfection procedures currently recommended by the ESGE. However, this measure is mentioned as an add-on procedure in a 1992 working party report by the British Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy Committee [9]. Surprisingly, a similar recommendation is also found in a former version of the ESGE guidelines (published in 1995) [10]. In the current version, for some reason, this paragraph has been deleted [2]. In the light of the present study, it might be re-incorporated in future ESGE guidelines. However, it is not clear whether contamination of endoscopes in our trial was due to inappropriate procedures or individual failure to adhere to the procedures.","In the present study, growth of bacteria was observed in a significant number of samples from endoscopes cleaned in accordance to current guidelines. Pathogenic bacteria, however, were found only in one out of 178 samples. Transmission of infectious agents through endoscopes cannot be excluded. Systematic microbiological investigation of endoscopes is recommended, especially in CRC screening, exposing presumptively healthy individuals to potentially infectious material. For the future, endoscopes with disposable sheaths, providing every screenee with a sterile endoscope may be desirable to prevent transmission of infectious agents [3, 12]."
5,Practice facilitation and academic detailing improves colorectal cancer screening rates in safety net primary care clinics,"SUNY Upstate Medical University entered a contract with Health Research, Inc. and the New York State Department of Health to implement an intervention using academic detailing and practice facilitation to increase colorectal cancer screening rates within primary care practices, and to assess the outcomes and barriers to intervention success. The project was conducted within a large multi-organizational framework, led by the Studying-Acting-Learning-Teaching Network (SALT-Net, SUNY Upstate Medical University) in partnership with the Upstate New York Network (UNYNET -University at Buffalo) and the Greater Rochester PBRN (GR-PBRN -University of Rochester Medical Center), under the auspices of the Upstate New York Translational Research Network (UNYTE).","Nine primary care practices enrolled in the project. Practices received a 1-hour academic detailing session on colorectal cancer screening guidelines, and two months of practice facilitation services to implement evidence based strategies to increase patient screening, with a particular focus on initiating and/or streamlining the use of electronic health record (EHR)-based patient screening registries. The impact of project participation on colorectal cancer screening as assessed through pre-and post-intervention screening rates.","Primary intervention activities completed by participating practices included efforts to address the data recording issues within practice EHR systems, provider feedback and assessment activities, streamlining of provider reminder systems, and patient education and outreach interventions. The difference between mean pre-and post-intervention screening rates was statistically significant (mean pre-rate 24.7% (SD 20.6%) vs. mean post-rate 26.4% (SD 20.5%), p = 0.028). A preliminary assessment indicates a mean relative increase of 30% between the pre-and post-screening rates.","This project evaluates the efficacy of a targeted intervention to implement evidence-based practices in a primary care setting to increase colorectal cancer screening rates, and provides tangible information on facilitators and barriers to implementing these practices in safety net clinics."
6,Immune monitoring in patients with colorectal cancer stage II,"To monitor the immune response in patients with stage II colorectal cancer, with a focus on cellular as well as humoral immunity. TGF-beta and VEGF levels were followed.","38 patients with stage II colon cancer included in the research project received routine cancer treatment. . Basic parameters – histological type and grade, proliferative markers – were established at baseline. Patients were evaluated by a clinical immunooncologist to exclude any immune disorders of allergic or autoimmune origin. TGF-beta and VEGF were measured using ELISA, and anti-tumour cellular immunity (CD4, CD8, T-reg, B cells) were measured via flow cytometry.","In patients with stage II colorectal cancer, predominantly a depression in cellular immunity was seen. Plasma levels of immunglobulins were also reduced, particularly the IgG3 subtype. Most patients showed some clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency, such as frequent respiratory tract infections and/or herpetic infections. TGF-beta and VEGF plasma levels were increased.","The correlation of these neoangiogenic and immunosuppressive factors, as well as the state of anticancer immunity, could help in the future as a prognostic marker and contribute to the selection of targeted adjuvant as well as immune therapy in patients with colorectal cancer stage II."
