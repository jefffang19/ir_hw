0,Facial skin metastasis of colorectal cancer: a case report,"Liver and lungs are common locations of distant metastases of colorectal cancer. Skin lesions are very rare they occur in 4-6.5% of cases [1, 2]. The most frequent localization of the skin metastases is postoperative scars [3]. Facial lesions are extremely uncommon. Literature mentions only a few cases of such pathology. Overall, skin metastasis is a poor prognostic marker, and medium survival is very short [2]. We report the second case of the metastasis of the colorectal cancer to the lip.","A circular tumor of the rectum located at 10 cm from the dentate line was diagnosed 4.5 years ago in a 65 year-old Lithuanian male. Histologically, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma G1 was identified. No distant metastases were found, and endorectal ultrasound revealed uT3N0 stage of the disease. Preoperative radiation was applied with the total dose of 45 Gy. After 6 weeks, low anterior resection with preventive ileostomy was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. Postoperative histological examination showed infiltrative mucinous adenocarcinoma of the rectum pT3 N0 M0 L0 V0 R0 G3, Astler - Coller B1. Six postoperative courses of 5-fluorouracil were applied. Preventive ileostomy was closed uneventfully on the 7th week after primary operation.The follow-up included twice-yearly abdominal ultrasound, chest x-ray, colonoscopy, and carcinoembryonic antigen.A small 0.5 cm diameter ulcer on the upper lip developed after 42 months following the removal of the primary tumor, and biopsy confirmed metastasis of the colorectal adenocarcinoma (Figure 1a. and 1b). This lesion was excised.Figure 1Immunohistochemically, the carcinoma cells, were focally positive for Cytokeratin (CK) 20 (a), but negative for CK 7 (b). This CK staining pattern suggested that the skin tumor was a metastasis from the previously resected rectal cancer.Full size imageSimultaneously, chest computed tomography scan showed a solitary mass of 3.4 cm in diameter in the lower lobe of the right lung, irregularly accumulating contrast medium. Consequently, lobectomy was performed. Postoperative histological examination showed moderately differentiated metastasis of the colorectal cancer G2. The postoperative period was uneventful. No progress of the disease was observed during the subsequent 7 months.","We have found only 15 articles describing metastases of colorectal cancer to the skin of head and neck. Facial localization is especially rare; and it has been mentioned in only in the 4 publications in English [1, 3–5]. One manuscript of these described facial metastasis involving oral commisure [5] and our manuscript report the second case of the metastasis of the colorectal cancer to the lip.Cancer of the large bowel most frequently metastasizes into the liver and lungs, but a skin lesion is very rare and could be observed in only 4-6.5% of cases [2]. Skin deposits are more typical for already metastatic colorectal cancer [3]. Metastatic lesions of the skin occur more frequently in cases of primary tumors of the lungs (up to 28.6% of all metastases) and breasts with equal distribution between males and females [2].The most frequent localization of skin metastases of the colorectal cancer is abdomen, especially in the postoperative scars - up to 0.6% of all patients [3]. According to the data of one of the largest reviews of colorectal skin metastases, in 3 (3.9%) out of 77 patients they occurred at the site of postoperative scar [2]. On the average, skin metastases occur after 4.9 years following the excision of the primary tumor.Clinically, metastases present as nodules, ulcers, cellulites or fibrous depositions. Histologically, they are classified as adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, non-differentiated carcinoma, or other types. All described facial metastases from colorectal cancer were adenocarcinomas.Colonic mucosa typically expresses cytokeratin (CK) 20 but not CK7. In this case CK20+/CK7-profile has been used to distinguish colonic adenocarcinoma from others arising in the lung, breast, or genitourinary tract, salivary gland. CK7 expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma has been reported to be rare, and when present, a metastatic origin needs to be excluded.Skin metastases are a poor prognostic sign and medium survival after diagnosis ranges between 2 and 4.5 months [2]. Slightly longer survival more than 18 months is observed in cases of head and neck lesions [3].Colon carcinoma is believed to metastasize initially through lymphatics and later through the haematogenous route. In this case, it is interesting and not clear, how after 42 months following the radical resection of the primary tumor (pT3 N0 M0 L0 V0 R0) and postoperative courses of the chemotherapy, the tumor metastasized to the facial region and lung.",Skin metastases in the face from colorectal cancer are very rare and may indicate tumour relapse several years after primary resection. These patients have a worse prognosis.
1,Adrenalectomy for solitary adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer: A case report,"Adrenal metastasis most commonly occurs in patients with lung, breast and renal cancer [1, 2]. In general, metastasis to the adrenal gland is regarded as an indicator of widespread disease, but in rare cases, isolated adrenal metastasis can be found [3–6]. Although the incidence varies among reports, it is generally accepted that adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) is relatively rare. As a result of recent advances in radiological noninvasive techniques, metastasis to the adrenal gland can be detected during follow up after primary operations for CRC. Whether isolated metastasis to the adrenal gland needs to be resected, remains controversial. Surgical resection of the involved adrenal gland seems to be able to provide a survival benefit for selected patients, according to several previously reported cases, whereas radiation and chemotherapy have relatively poor results for these lesions [1, 4, 7].","A 63-year-old-woman presented with lower abdominal pain and anal bleeding on defecation. Colonoscopy revealed intraluminal stenosis of the colorectal junction and biopsy specimens were obtained. Histologically, a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. There was no evidence of metastasis, based on the results of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray, while (carcinoembryonic antigen) CEA was normal at 2.36 ng/ml. The patient underwent low anterior resection for CRC on 14 July 2004. The lesion was a stage Â2 (Astler-Coller) tumour, 3,0 × 2.5 cm in size, located in the rectosigmoid colon. Microscopic examination showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, penetrating the muscularis propria, without lymphatic and vascular invasion and without metastases to 15 dissected lymph nodes. According to the classification of TNM (tumour, lymph nodes, metastasis), the disease was stage II. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was started on adjuvant chemotherapy, comprised of oxaliplatin i.v., 85 mg/m2 (on day 1), leukovorin i.v., 200 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), 5 FU (fluorouracil) i.v., bolus 400 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), 5 FU i.v., 22 hours-infusion, 600 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), every 2 weeks for 12 cycles.Four months after the operation the patient underwent a cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, confirmed by ultrasound. Microscopic examination showed no evidence of malignancy of the gallbladder. One year after the cholecystectomy, a follow up abdominal C.T. detected a tumour 3 cm in diameter in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 1). The level of serum CEA remained within the normal range. Colonoscopy, mammography, and scintiscan (a two-dimensional record of the distribution of a bone-seeking radioactive material, obtained by means of a scanning scintillation counter) of the bones showed no signs of metastasis. Left lower pneumonectomy was performed; the tumour's maximum diameter was 3 cm and microscopic examination showed complete removal of a metastatic, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, without vascular infiltration, compatible with the resected rectosigmoid carcinoma. Immunohistochemically the tumour cells were strongly positive for Keratin 20 and negative for Keratin 7 and (thyroid transcription factor 1) TTF-1 antigen. However, one of the 13 resected peribroncheal lymph nodes was involved. The chemotherapy was changed to bevacizumab i.v. 5 mg/kg (on day 1), irinotecan i.v., 180 mg/m2 (on day 1), leukovorin i.v., 200 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), 5 FU i.v., bolus, 400 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), 5 FU i.v., 22 hours-infusion, 600 mg/m2 (on days 1,2), every 2 weeks for 6 cycles. Four months after the lower pneumonectomy a follow-up CT-MRI identified a nodule in the right adrenal gland, 2 × 1 cm in size [4]. Since there were no other signs of local recurrence or distant metastasis on radiological, endoscopic and laboratory examinations, with CEA level still within the normal range, the right adrenal mass was regarded as an isolated heterochronic metastasis from CRC and resection was considered. Right adrenalectomy through a midline abdominal approach was performed. The tumour's maximal diameter was 2.1 cm while the maximum diameter of the adrenal gland was 5.2 cm (Figures 2 &3). Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical studies showed complete removal of a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma compatible with the rectosigmoid carcinoma resected one year and 7 months earlier. The chemotherapy was once again changed to cetuximab i.v., 250 mg/m2, irinotecan i.v., 125 mg/m2 (on days 1,8), every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.Figure 1

By performing a medline literature search, we were able to identify 24 previously reported cases of resection of adrenal metastasis from CRC [1–9]. Five of these, including ours, had also lung metastasis either synchronous or metachronous [1–9]. It is conceived that a number of routes of adrenal metastasis from CRC exist, including systemic venous, portal venous, arterial, and lymphatic routes [2]. Katayama et al. suggested that there is a route of hematogenous metastasis from the primary lesion via the lung to the adrenal gland [3]. Thus, the significance of long-term follow-up after resection of CRC for early detection of adrenal metastasis, especially after resection of lung metastasis, should not be overlooked.Patients' serum CEA levels are usually elevated when a metastasis is diagnosed, and CEA is considered to be useful for indicating the presence of adrenal metastasis after surgery for CRC [3]. However, the serum level of CEA in our patient was normal despite the occurrence of lung and adrenal metastasis. Nevertheless, the ability to detect clinically silent adrenal metastasis has increased due to the widespread use of imaging modalities, including ultrasonography, CT and MRI. Therefore, in addition to measuring serum CEA, these modalities can be used in the follow up of patients who undergo a primary operation for CRC.Adrenal metastasis from CRC is usually a part of systemic disease, accompanied by poor prognosis and has been regarded as having no indication for surgical resection [3, 4]. On the other hand, resection of solitary adrenal metastasis from CRC should be offered to patients with significant (> 6 months) disease free interval, since it may improve chances of survival [1, 3]. However, patients whose adrenal metastases are discovered synchronously or within 6 months of diagnosis of the primary tumour are less amenable to cure from metastasectomy. This may be due to the intrinsic biologic aggressiveness of the tumour and its metastases. Kim et al suggest that all metastases are present microscopically or macroscopically at the time of primary tumour diagnosis and that metastatic deposits which remain clinically undetectable beyond 6 months reflect the slow-growing nature of these tumours [1].One could argue that it was the change in chemo regime rather than the surgical resection that helped the patient. In a recent review paper [10], Gundgaard et al reported median time to progression (mTTP) up to 7 months and a medium overall survival (mOS) of 16 months with third line chemotherapy. The highest mÔÔP, 9.8 months, was reported for the combination of cetuximab combined with irinotecan, the treatment our patient received.It is difficult to determine whether adrenal metastasectomy has affected the natural history of our patient. However, it is evident that nonsurgical treatment of solitary adrenal metastases has been associated with poor survival. The small number of patients with isolated adrenal metastasis of colorectal carcinoma makes a randomized, prospective trial comparing surgical resection to other treatment modalities highly unlikely.Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has rapidly replaced open adrenalectomy as the procedure of choice for benign adrenal tumours in the last decades. However, laparoscopic resection is controversial for large, potentially malignant adrenal tumours and necessitates experience in open surgery and advanced laparoscopic surgery [11]. Therefore it is essential to differentiate benign and non-functional lesions from malignant or hormonally active ones so that appropriate treatment strategies can be initiated. In our case, since the adrenal mass was possibly malignant, we performed an open adrenalectomy.","Adrenal metastasis from CRC via the lung to the adrenal gland is considered to be relatively rare. It is generally accepted that a solitary adrenal metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum should be resected to achieve good prognosis. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of adrenal metastasis from CRC during follow-up after the primary operation. To detect adrenal metastasis early, radiological modalities such as US, CT and MRI as well as the measurement of serum CEA, should be done regularly. New modalities, such as (2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography) 18F-FDG PET and (Computed Tomography-Positron Emission Tomography) CT-PET may offer better chances to detect clinically silent adrenal metastasis in the future."
2,Measuring constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research in the context of increasing colorectal cancer screening at community health centers,"The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a comprehensive meta-framework widely applied to implementation related studies. Yet, few have used validated measures to operationalize constructs in CFIR in real-life settings. In this study, we operationalized selected CFIR constructs in an assessment to identify factors influencing implementation of evidence-based practices for increasing colorectal cancer screening in Community Health Centers (CHC).","We selected 16 constructs from all five domains of CFIR. Measures were developed and tested in a cross-sectional survey with CHCs' clinical staff and leaders respectively. We performed a separate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for measures with three or more items, computed inter-item consistency (Cronbach's alpha), inter-rater reliability (ICC) and agreement (rWG(J)) statistics, and assessed construct validity via inter-correlations among constructs at individual and organizational levels.","A total of 277 individuals and 59 CHC clinics were included in the analysis. CFA showed satisfactory structural validity (CFI>0.90, TLI>0.90, SRMR<0.08, RMSEA<0.08); all measures showed reasonable reliability (alpha>0.70). The ICCs (>0.1) and rWG(J) (>0.75) suggest it appropriate to aggregate individual responses by computing clinic means. Results also suggest good construct validity at both individual and clinic levels. Inner setting and process-related constructs are correlated with most variables across domains; correlations between outer setting and intervention characteristics and other domains vary more noticeably by construct.","Our study is one of the first to quantitatively measure constructs from all five domains of CFIR and demonstrate their psychometric properties. We depicted their inter-correlations at multiple levels, which set the foundation for establishing predictive models, causal pathways and developing interventions that target these factors. These findings could contribute to further development of the CFIR."
3,Colorectal cancer surgery in the elderly: oncologic results from our experience,"Colorectal cancer is a disease of elderly people, since over 70% of cases occur in patients aged 65 years or older, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of surgical treatment in this population referred to our institution.",A retrospective analysis of a geriatric population (>65 years) was proposed to review the risks and the benefits of surgery for colorectal cancer (2006–April 2008). Measures of the effectiveness of surgery included overall survival and disease-free survival with emphasis to age-related risk factors.,"A total of 100 patients with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer were identified. Of these, 71 patients were 65 years of age or older. Gender: 45 Male/26 Female. The median age was 75.3 years. Sixteen (11%) patients were octogenarians. Fifty-seven patients (78%) showed pre-existing co-morbidities age-related: diabetes mellitus, cardiopulmonary disease, and chronic renal disease. Most clinical cases presented with obstructive ileum symptoms and anemia. Combined neoadjuvant therapies based on radio-chemotherapy protocols (RT-CHT) were carried out successfully in 9 patients. Surgery was performed in emergency in 4 cases (6%). Most patients had left-sides tumors and underwent to low anterior resection (29 cases: 20.5%), 4 cases of left hemicolectomy, 3 patients showed an advanced rectal tumor that required Hartman colostomy, 12 cases of sigmoidectomy, 5 abdominal perineal resection, and 2 cases of subtotal colectomy. Sixteen patients (11.4%) had right-sided tumors and underwent to right hemicolectomy. In 29 cases was realized a stoma (10 colostomies and 19 loop ileostomies). Laparoscopic approach was proposed in 11 patients, carried out in 7 cases successfully. In 14 patients, a synchronous hepatic metastasis was diagnosed, 4 lung metastasis and 1 case of peritoneal carcinosis. In 3 patients combined resection of the primary tumor together with liver metastasis was performed with cyto-reduction intent.The majority of tumors presented type II cell grading (G2). MSH-2 and MLH-1 gene products were expressed in 97% of all tissue specimens. The serum analysis of tumor antigens (Ca 19-9, CEA, AFP) was negative in 47 cases (66%).According to Astler and Coller's staging of neoplastic disease, this was the pathological founding: Stage A 33%, B1 27%, B2 1%, C1 13%, C2 6% and D 20%. A surgical resection with tumor-free microscopic margins (RO) was archived in 70 cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 48 patients (68%). Of these, 53% concerned medical complications. The major complications were analyzed in according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physiological status scoring system. ASA score, strongly depending to clinical functional status, was a preoperative parameter able to determine the surgical morbidity.Perioperative mortality rate was 5%. Hospitalization was in media of 15 days and the follow-up for an average of 24 months. Considering the analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival at 24 months, a better trend in term of prognosis was observed in a geriatric cohort of patients with age >70 years. The overall survival at 24 months was 81.4% for patients >70 years vs 70.9% for the younger group. The disease-free survival at 24 months was 81.4% vs 60.6% respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves for the overall survival and disease-free rates showed no statistically significance (p: ns log-rank).",Recent studies demonstrated that elderly patients often received sub-optimal surgical and medical treatments because of unacceptable prejudices. The relationship between age and outcomes is complex and depend by differences in tumor-stage and pre-existing co-morbidities. Chronological age alone does not provide sufficient guidance for surgical effectiveness. Key parameters in the surgical risk assessment are represented by biological indexes of each patient. The oncologic results and the morbidity rates of our experience confirm that surgery is a safe therapy in most elderly patients when operative risk and associated diseases evaluation has been careful calculated. The role of surgery in colorectal cancer geriatric patients is well defined in the scientific literature. More comprehensive insights in oncologist surgery of elderly population will derive from the better understanding of the physiology of aging and combined therapies.
4,Incidence of synchronous appendiceal neoplasm in patients with colorectal cancer and its clinical significance,"Synchronous colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported in 0.6–1.4 percent of patients and metachronous CRC in 1–8 percent of patients [1]. Any neoplastic change of the colon and rectum could possibly affect the appendix because the appendix is derived embryologically from the large intestine and has a similar mucosal pattern to the colon and rectum. The histological features of appendiceal adenocarcinoma are also identical to those of colorectal adenocarcinoma [2]. Moreover, it has been reported that almost a quarter of patients with appendiceal cancer are found to have synchronous or metachronous neoplasms elsewhere in the large intestine [2, 3].Although there have been increasing advances in both endoscopy and radiology, the appendiceal mucosa remains inaccessible and the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal neoplasm is still poor. During an operation, a correct diagnosis is made in less than half of the cases [4]. Several case reports of synchronous appendiceal tumors in CRC patients have been published in the literature [5–9], but only one study has explored its incidence which is about 4 percent of CRC patients having synchronous appendiceal neoplasm [7]. Given the difficulty in diagnosis of appendiceal tumors and the certain risk of synchronous and metachronous neoplasm of the appendix, the question of whether an incidental appendectomy should be performed in CRC patients has been raised [5, 7].In attempt to address this question, it is first essential to know the incidence and the biological significance of synchronous appendiceal tumors in CRC patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of synchronous appendiceal neoplasm in patients with resectable CRC in a university hospital, and to determine the clinical significance of these findings.","Pathological reports and medical records were retrospectively reviewed of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent oncological resection of the tumor together with appendectomy at the Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand between September 2000 and April 2008. Patients were excluded if they had familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome or had had a previous appendectomy, or if there had been direct invasion of CRC to the appendix. Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy were also excluded. Notably, there were about 100–120 operations for CRC per annum in our unit, and one-third of them were for right-sided colon cancer.The appendix is normally a part of the specimen removed in patients with right hemicolectomy. All the appendices removed along with the right colon specimen were systematically analyzed. Incidental appendectomy had also been performed in patients who had undergone left hemicolectomy or rectal resection at the discretion of the surgeon. We tended to perform incidental appendectomy if the patient was younger than 45 years, or there was a fecalith in the appendix. Histopathological study of the appendix included gross and microscopic examination. Specimens were sectioned at the tip, body, and base of the appendix as well as other suspicious lesions. All specimens were examined by a consultant or senior pathologist.The site of the primary tumor, type of operation, and pathological staging of CRC were noted. Macroscopic and microscopic features of the appendix were also recorded. The presence of synchronous appendiceal tumors and/or metastasis was correlated with follow-up data to demonstrate the clinical significance of these findings. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.","Two hundred and ninety-three patients were included in this study. The patients studied had an average age of 62 years (range 19–95) and 51 percent were male. Of the patients studied, 228 (78 percent) had a right hemicolectomy, 45 (15 percent) had a left hemicolectomy, and 20 (7 percent) had surgery for rectal cancer. One patient (0.3 percent) had epithelial appendiceal neoplasm (mucinous cystadenoma), and 3 patients (1.0 percent) had metastatic colorectal cancer in the mesoappendix (Table 1). All metastatic lesions were mucinous adenocarcinoma. Clusters of metastatic cancerous cells were 1–5 mm in diameter; primarily located in the subserosal area. All appendices with neoplasms did not appear abnormal in the preoperative imaging and during the intraoperative examination. However, the case of metastases in the mesoappendix from a descending colon cancer was associated to other peritoneal implants.Table 1 Patients' characteristics, details of primary colorectal cancer, and pathological results of synchronous appendiceal neoplasmFull size tableThere was no specific morbidity that could be attributed to incidental appendectomy in the present study. The presence of synchronous appendiceal tumors and/or metastasis did not alter postoperative management, as these patients had received adjuvant therapy and were scheduled for surveillance program because of nodal involvement.","The question of whether an incidental appendectomy should be performed in CRC patients has been raised due to the difficulty in diagnosis of appendiceal tumors and the certain risk of synchronous and metachronous neoplasm of the appendix [5, 7]. Little is known about the incidence of appendiceal neoplasm in CRC patients. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one study determining such an incidence [7]. Khan and Moran retrospectively reviewed 169 CRC patients who underwent CRC surgery and removal of the appendix in Basingstoke, United Kingdom. They reported 4.1 percent synchronous primary appendiceal neoplasm in these patients, and mucinous cystadenoma was the most common neoplasm found [7]. Furthermore, these authors suggested performing incidental appendectomy in all CRC patients. Meanwhile, Albright et al determined the cost-effectiveness of interval appendectomy in patients who undergo curative resection for CRC and found that the benefit in cost was only realized for patients younger than 45 years of age [5].Synchronous CRC and appendiceal tumors have been observed in high-risk patients such as those with long-standing ulcerative colitis [10]. Moreover, patients with rectal cancer had a slightly higher rate of synchronous appendiceal tumors than those with right-sided colon cancer [7]. However, absent from the literature are such studies in Asian population, in which the incidence of synchronous appendiceal neoplasms in CRC patients could be different.The present study in Thailand demonstrates that the incidence of synchronous primary appendiceal neoplasm and secondary (metastatic) appendiceal neoplasm in patients with resectable CRC is 0.3 and 1.0 percent, respectively. One possible explanation for the low incidence of synchronous primary neoplasm of the appendix in CRC patients in the present study could be that tumorigenesis of the appendix and other parts of the large intestine are not the same. Appendiceal mucosa is not directly exposed to potential carcinogens in fecal material as the colorectal mucosa is. Epidemiological study revealed that appendiceal tumors account for 0.4–1 percent of alimentary tract cancers and are found in 0.7–1.7 percent of appendectomy specimens [11], whilst CRC is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy [12]. Also, the peak incidence of appendiceal neoplasm is in patients in their early forties, 20-year younger than that of CRC [13]. It is possible that the incidence of appendiceal tumors in Asian population is different from that of Western population [14], and thus the incidence of synchronous appendieal neoplasms in CRC patients could vary among various ethnic and geographic backgrounds. Lastly, in view of the examination of the specimens, different protocols of tissue section and methods of histopathological examination may lead to differences in the incidence percentages.The unexpected finding in the present study was that one percent of CRC patients had metastatic lesions in the mesoappendix. This finding was fairly consistent with a previous study by Albright and his colleagues [5]. They reported 2 cases of metastatic implants to the appendix from routine interval appendectomy in 210 patients with intraabdominal malignancy; accounting for 0.95%. One case was secondary to a sigmoid cancer with limited peritoneal carcinomatosis while the other was secondary to an ovarian adenocarcinoma. As the mesoappendix encloses the appendiceal artery and vein, together with lymphatic vessels and lymph node, metastasis to the mesoappendix could occur via the lymphatic, hematogenous or transcoelomic route. With regard to the transcoelomic route, CRC may spread throughout the peritoneum either via the subperitoneal lymphatic drainage or by viable cells being shed from the serosal surface of a tumor [15]. This is supported by the observations that 14.6 percent of CRC had positive cytology for cancer cells on the peritoneal or perirectal surface of the bowel, particularly in those with extensive lymphatic involvement, poorly differentiated tumors, or liver metastases [16]. Metastasis to the appendix has been reported in both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric [17], pancreatic [18], ovarian [5, 19], cervical [20], nasopharyngeal [21], breast [22], and lung [23].A limitation of this single-center study is a relatively small sample size, particularly those with left-sided colon cancer and rectal cancer. Considering this reason, a larger number of incidental appendectomy in patients with left-sided colon cancer and rectal cancer are warranted to verify our findings. Besides, this review has some limitations which are mainly inherent to a retrospective study and to different clinical judgments of surgeons. There could be a selection bias to perform incidental appendectomy as we did not have specific criteria for performing appendectomy in CRC patient at our institute. It is possible that the appendix was more likely to be removed because of its abnormal appearance. In order to determine the true incidence of synchronous appendiceal neoplasms, a cohort or prospective study of patients where the appendix is always removed (either by necessity in a right hemicolectomy specimen; or as a protocol where the appendix is always removed in CRC patients) is required."
