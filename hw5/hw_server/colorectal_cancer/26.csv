0,Effects of genetic variations in the Adiponectin pathway genes on the risk of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors worldwide[1]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that some risk factors and interactions between genetic and environmental factors may play important roles in the pathogenesis of that cancer [2, 3]. For example, individual genetic susceptibility is likely to play an important role in the development of some 35% of the CRC cases [4], suggesting that genetic background is one of the critical CRC risk factors [5, 6].Many studies have demonstrated that obesity could increase the risk of cancer, including CRC [7–9]. In obese patients, adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipose tissue, has lower expression than that in non-obese subjects [10, 11], implying that decreased expression of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) may be associated with an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans [12–15]. Adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in colonic tissue [16]. For example, the expression of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 are higher in colorectal carcinomas than in normal colonic epithelium [17]. Adiponectin seems to act in preneoplastic colonic lesions to regulate cell growth by activating, altering, or interacting with several pathways including leptin and NFκB pathway [18]. However, the opposite evidence has shown that adiponectin plasma levels are inversely associated with the risk of CRC [13], and that adiponectin can suppress the cell proliferation of colon cancer via AdipoR1- and -R2-mediated AMPK activation[19].Several polymorphisms of adiponectin have been shown to affect adiponectin plasma levels[20, 21]. Polymorphisms of the ligand (ADIPOQ,) and its type 1 receptor (ADIPOR1) are associated with the risk for insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus [20–26]. Polymorphisms of ADIPOR1 have been associated with the risk for cancers, probably by affecting adiponectin plasma levels [27–30]. Polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene have also been shown to correlate with adiponectin plasma levels, The genotypes rs266729 C/C, rs1501299 T/T, and rs2241766 G/G were respectively associated with decreased adiponectin plasma levels [20, 21], suggesting that these polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk of developing CRC. In a population-based case-control study, we genotyped seven polymorphisms of ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 genes to confirm such a hypothesis.","Four hundred and twenty inpatients who had been diagnosed histologically as CRC (colon cancer, n = 191, and rectum cancer, n = 229) in Nanjing First hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from January 2007 to January 2010 were recruited consecutively for this study. The case cohort ranged in age from 30 to 93 years (mean ± SD, 62.9 ± 12.3 years). Five hundred and fifty five age-and gender-matched healthy individuals who came to hospital for routine health check were employed as non-cancer controls whose ages ranged from 44 to 91 years (mean ± SD, 61.7 ± 10.7 years). Both case and control cohorts were from the same geographic region of Nanjing City, Jiangsu, China. For all CRC cases and control individuals, clinical characteristics of each subject, including smoking [Cumulative cigarette dose (pack-years) was calculated by the following formula: pack-years = (packs per day)×(years smoked), those who had smoked at least once a day for >1 year in their lifetime were considered smokers, and non-smokers were defined as ones who had stopped smoking at least 1 year before diagnosis in the patients and 1 year before the date signed on an informed consent for blood sample collection in the case of controls or who had never smoked in their lifetime.], drinking and related disease history (such as other cancer, diabetes and so on), was collected via a questionnaire designed in-house by the Department of Gastroenterology in the hospital. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between the two groups. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital, and written informed consents were obtained from all participants.Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CRC patients and controls using a E.Z.N.A.® SE Blood DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc, Norcross, GA, UAS) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed by a cell lysis solution and contaminated RNA in the samples was then removed by RNase A treatment and the protein was precipitated by the protein precipitation solution. The genomic DNA was finally precipitated by isopropanol, followed by being washed with 70% ethanol.Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was applied to detect the polymorphic sites of ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 as shown in Table 1. PCR amplification was performed in a 25 μL reaction system consisting of 0.5 mmol/L of each primer, 4 mmol/L of MgCl2, 1.25 U of Ampli Taq Polymerase, and PCR buffer (10 mmol/L of Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 50 mmol/L of KCl). After the denaturation at 94°C 5 min, DNA amplification was achieved by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at a certain temperature (as shown in Table 1) for 30 sec, extension at 72°C for 30 sec, and then followed by 72°C for 7 min. For restriction enzyme digestion, 10 μL PCR product was digested by 10 U of Hin6I (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) with buffer Tango for rs266729, Hinf I (MBI) with buffer B for rs822395, AvaI (MBI) with buffer Tango for rs2241766, NspI(MBI) with buffer Tango for rs1501299, and NsiI (MBI) with buffer R for rs12733285 in a final volume of 30 μL and incubated at 37°C(Tru9 I with buffer R for rs822396 at 65°C) overnight. Moreover, 10U BccI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) with NEBuffer 1 was utilized for digesting the 10 μL PCR product of rs1342387 in a final volume of 30 μL and incubated at 37°C overnight. Deoxyribonucleic acid fragments of rs266729, rs1342387 and rs822396 were separated by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis, and 4% agarose gel was used for the fragment of rs822395, rs2241766, rs2232853 and rs12733285. To validate the genotyping results, the genotyping experiments were repeated, a random selection of 10% of all samples was genotyped twice by direct sequence for quality control.Table 1 Primers and PCR conditions for genotype detection of ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1

Statistical analysis of genotype distribution and allele frequencies was performed by using the χ2 test with SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. Differences in mean values were evaluated using t-test. The P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","Four hundred twenty patients with colorectal cancer and five hundred fifty and five healthy controls were evaluated in this population-based case-control association study, and there were no statistically significant differences in their demographic data and clinical characteristics as summarized in Table 2.Table 2 Demographic and clinical characteristics of CRC patients and the controlsFull size table
The genotype distribution of the polymorphisms of ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 between the cases and controls are presented in Table 3. The observed frequencies of all tested genotypes and alleles in controls did not derivate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significantly decreased risk (adjusted OR, 0.53; 95% CI: 0.35-0.81) for the rs12733285 C/T heterozygote when compared with the rs12733285 C/C wild-type homozygote as shown in Table 3. Similarly, carriers of the A allele (rs1342387 A/G or A/A) had decreased risk (adjusted OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.45-0.78, and adjusted OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39-0.89, respectively) for CRC compared with noncarriers (i.e., rs1342387 G/G) as shown in Table 3, suggesting that carriers of the rs1342387 A allele had a significantly decreased risk for colorectal cancer (adjusted OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.46-0.77). In contrast, the distribution of the five polymorphisms (rs266729, rs822395, rs822396, rs1501766 and rs1501299) in ADIPOQ was not statistically significantly different between the case and control groups as shown in Table 3.Table 3 The genotype distribution of ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 in CRC patients and controlsFull size table
Subgroup analysis was performed based on the tumor site in this study, and logistic regression analysis revealed a significantly increased risk for the rs266729G/C heterozygote (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05-2.14) as compared with the rs266729 C/C wild-type homozygote as shown in Table 4, suggesting that carriers of the 266729 G allele had a significantly increased risk for colorectal cancer (adjusted OR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.03-2.05). However, there was no difference in the genotype distribution between the sub-cohort of colon cancer and rectal cancer.Table 4 Genotype distribution in relation to sub sites in colorectal cancerFull size table
Through the population-based case-control study of 420 CRC patients and 555 age-and gender- matched healthy controls in the Chinese population, we observed that CRC patients had lower frequency of rs2733285C/T and rs1342387A/G or A/A than healthy controls, and that carriers of the rs2733285T and rs1342387A allele had a significantly decreased risk for developing CRC. Moreover, we also revealed that rs266729G/C genotype and rs266729G allele was a risk factor for colon cancer.It has been well known that obesity is one of the major risks for CRC [31, 32] and that lack of physical exercise, diets with high sugar, refined grains, and low fiber are all believed as the risks of CRC [33–36]. Adiponectin is secreted by adipose tissue, and epidemic studies have demonstrated that its plasma levels were inversely correlated to BMI [37, 38]. Recent studies have shown that polymorphism in ADIPOQ (rs2241766) is associated with the risk of breast cancer [27], and that a polymorphism rs266729 is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer [28]. However, in this case-control study, we failed to replicate the association between the two positive variants at ADIPOQ (rs2241766, and rs266729) and CRC risk in Chinese population. Our findings are consistent with the studies reported in Czech [30] and British populations[39]. However, our subgroup analysis still revealed that rs266729 G/C and 266729 G allele were risk factors for colon cancer but not for rectal cancer. These findings may partly explain the previous contradictive studies on the association between the polymorphism of rs2241766 and CRC risk [28]. Moreover, basic research had also predicted that ADIPOQ and ADIPOR have more potential effects on colon cancer than on rectal cancer [40], indicating that rs266729 G/C and 266729 G allele were risk factors for colon cancer but not for rectal cancer, several studies have confirmed that polymorphisms rs266729 C/C, rs1501299 T/T and rs2241766 G/G in the ADIPOQ were associated with adiponectin plasma levels [20, 21, 24]. In particularly, such association were also deduced in Chinese population that G allele of rs266729 was significantly associated with lower adiponectin plasma levels[41], and that low levels of adiponectin was associated with the increased risk of CRC [13, 42].The association between adiponectin type 1 receptor level and the two polymorphisms (rs12733285, rs1342387) in ADIPOR was still unclear. In this case-control study, the association between polymorphisms in ADIPOR1 (rs12733285, rs1342387) and CRC risk has also been investigated, and the results indicate that individuals with rs12733285C/T or rs1342387A/G or A/A had a decreased risk of CRC, which was similar with the finding in North American populations [28]. However, we have not observed the rs12733285T/T genotype both in case and control groups, in a sharp contrast with 15% of the rs12733285T/T genotype in North American population [27, 28]. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with Hap-Map data among western Asian population http://www.hapmap.org/index.html.en. For polymorphism (rs1342387) of ADIPOR1, the distribution of genotypes in our studies was similar to the results by Wang et al [43]. Previous clinical studies have shown that the genotypes rs1342387A/G or A/A were associated with higher adiponectin plasma levels [21], and G/G genotype of rs1342387 of the ADIPOR1 gene was also associated with the indicators of obesity [44, 45]. Therefore, the reason of the G/G genotype of rs1342387 as a risk factor for CRC may be correlated to obesity and insulin resistance. In addition, clinical studies have also revealed that adiponectin type 1 receptor is related to colorectal cancer progression[46]. However, the function of rs1342387 in ADIPOR1 remains unclear, and the direct relationship between rs1342387 and the risk of CRC needs to be further evaluated.","This case-control study demonstrates that polymorphisms in ADIPOR1 (rs12733285, rs1342387) are associated with the decreased risk of CRC, and polymorphism in ADIPOQ (rs266729) is a risk for colon cancer but not for rectal cancer."
1,A genome wide association study on Newfoundland colorectal cancer patients’ survival outcomes,"One of the current interests of medicine is to first identify and then integrate new prognostic markers in prediction models that can help distinguish cancer patients with different risks of disease outcome after diagnosis. Genetic sequence variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may have biological roles in modifying the outcome risk and are the focus of the many current prognostic studies. Among many genetic approaches applied, the genomewide SNP survival association studies are considered useful as they examine a large number of genetic markers scattered along the DNA covering the majority of the genomic regions. Several studies applied this approach to identify genetic markers with prognostic associations in cancer such as pancreatic [1], esophageal [2], breast [3], and lung [4] cancers.Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy [5]. Mortality rates of this disease have been decreasing in many countries including Asian [6], European [7], and North American countries (Canada [8] and the USA [9]). Yet even with this improvement in patient survival, the 5-year survival rate for this disease is estimated to be 62-64% in North America [10,11]. In other parts of the world, such as in India and Eastern European countries, these rates are lower [12]. In Canada, one of the highest incidence rates of colorectal cancer is observed in the Newfoundland population [10]. This population is also characterized by a high incidence of familial colorectal cancer [13] and by one of the lowest cancer survival rates in Canada [14].The disease stage remains as the most important indicator of prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Research reported in the literature suggests that other factors may also modify the prognosis, such as age at diagnosis, tumor location [15], vascular/lymphatic invasion [16], and molecular features such as the microsatellite instability (MSI) status [17,18].MSI-high (MSI-H) is observed in almost 15% of the colon cancers and is characterized by inactivation of DNA mismatch repair genes either by germ line mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 genes (inherited colon cancer syndrome known as the Lynch syndrome; [19]) or by the somatic promoter hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene (sporadic colorectal cancer with MSI-H [20]). Patients with the MSI-H tumors have better survival rates than the patients with MSI-low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors and the chromosomal instability (CIN) + tumors [17,18]. In addition, MSI-H tumor phenotype is rarely observed in rectal cancers [21] and colon and rectal cancers also differ from each other in terms of other molecular alterations, risk of recurrence, and treatment approaches [15,22,23].Identification of genetic predictors of disease outcomes in cancer patients is a promising research aim. Till now, studies aiming to test the potential of polymorphisms as prognostic markers in colorectal cancer have been restricted to the candidate gene or pathway approaches. In this study, for the first time we performed a genomewide survival association study for patients with MSS or MSI-L tumors (MSS/MSI-L; n = 431). In addition, due to the differences between the colon and rectal cancers, as an exploratory analysis we investigated the prognostic associations of the same genetic markers in the rectal (n = 171) and colon cancer (n = 334) patients separately.","The baseline demographic, clinical and pathological data for the patients in the MSS/MSI-L, colon, and rectal cancer patient groups are shown in Table 1. The MSS/MSI-L patient group was the largest (n = 431), followed by colon (n = 334) and rectal (n = 171) patient groups. The number of events for overall survival (i.e. death) was 158, 105 and 65 in MSS/MSI-L, colon and rectal groups and for disease free survival (i.e. recurrence, metastasis or death) was 184, 121 and 79 in the same groups, respectively. For the entire cohort (n = 505), the 5-year and 10-year survival probabilities were 79.0% and 46.4% for OS and the 5-year and 10-year disease-free probabilities were 68.5% and 49.1%, respectively.Table 1

The Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots that were drawn for each sub-group and each outcome are shown in the Additional file 1. These plots show that the models on the genome-wide scan satisfy the expected distribution and suggest the appropriateness of the multivariate model settings.As a result of the statistical analysis, possibly due to the limited sample size, no association with genome-wide association significance levels (p < 5.0E-08) was detected in models constructed. But, ten SNPs showed suggestive associations with OS and DFS times (p < 1.0E-06), which is the nominal significance cut-off level in our study (Table 2). Manhattan plots for the patient cohorts and outcomes are shown in Additional file 1. For the interested readers, the list of associations detected at a p-value less than 1.0E-05 can be found in Additional file 2.Table 2

In the MSS/MSI-L patient group association study, there were two SNPs in the DFS model that achieved the nominal-significance level (Table 2). The HRs obtained as a result of the bootstrap method demonstrated the robustness of the results from the original association analysis (Additional file 3). One of these SNPs (rs6720296) was a frequent variant (MAF: 40%) and based on the information in the dbSNP database [24], was located in a non-coding RNA gene (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1121; LINC01121). The second marker (rs1407508) was a relatively infrequent SNP (MAF: 5.8%) located in a non-coding region on chromosome 9.In the colon patient group analysis, two SNPs showed nominally-significant signals in OS or DFS models (Table 2). These SNPs were located in non-coding regions along the chromosome 20 and 14.Among all groups, the rectal cancer patient group was the one with the largest group of SNPs identified, the majority of which were intergenic. In this patient cohort, two SNPs in OS model and four SNPs in DFS model had p-value lower than the cut-off level (p < 1.0x10−6) (Table 2). Interestingly, one intergenic SNP was associated with both OS and DFS in this patient group (rs6854845). Among the six SNPs, rs17057166 was the only one located in a gene (non-coding RNA; AC011343.1).None of the SNPs in Table 2 were amino acid changing SNPs (non-synonymous). As of February 2015, there was no publication in PUBMED about these SNPs. A search at the Regulome DB database [25] returned information for five of the polymorphisms (rs17026425, rs1407508, rs17280262, rs17057166, and rs6854845). According to these results, rs17026425 (Regulome DB score: 3a) is located within a transcription factor (such as JUND) binding site, yet it is “relatively less likely to affect protein binding”. For rs1407508 (Regulome DB score: 4), rs17280262, rs17057166, and rs6854845 (Regulome DB scores: 5), Regulome DB suggests that there is minimal or no evidence of proteins binding to the DNA sequences where these SNPs are located.An additional information related to the genes for the SNPs with p-values less than 1.0x10−5 is shown in the Additional file 4.","In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of a large number of SNPs (n = 729,737) with overall or disease free survival times in Caucasian colorectal cancer patients from Newfoundland, Canada. Our primary aim was to investigate the associations of SNPs with the disease outcome in the patients with MSI-L or MSS tumors (n = 431) as the outcome risks for this group of patients and the patients with the MSI-H tumors are significantly different from each other [17,18]. In addition, due to the differences between the colon and rectal cancer patients (for example the relatively decreased recurrence risk as well as the higher number of MSI-H tumors in colon cancer patients compared to the rectal cancer patients [15,21]), as an exploratory analysis, separate analyses for the colon (n = 334) and rectal (n = 171) cancer patients were also performed. Of note, due to the small number of the patients with MSI-H tumors (n = 53), we have not attempted the statistical analyses in this group.The main result of this study is that none of the genetic markers investigated reached the genomewide significance levels (5.0E-08) in either overall or disease free survival analyses in any of the patient groups investigated. Thus, we were not able to identify a genetic marker with a strong association with the risk of main clinical outcomes (i.e. death, local or distant metastases) in colorectal cancer. This can be interpreted as that none of the genetic markers investigated are related to the survival outcomes of interest. Alternatively, this can be also due to the fact that the sample sizes of the patient cohorts investigated in this study were small and thus our study power was limited to detect possible associations (see Methods). Considering this study power issue, in this manuscript we present and discuss the SNPs with p-values (<1.0E-06) higher than the genome-wide significance levels as potentially promising genetic markers (Table 2). We suggest that these markers may be promising and should be investigated in larger-sized cohorts to test whether they are associated with the colorectal cancer prognosis. Further research may also be performed to test whether the two non-coding RNA genes (AC011343.1 and LINC01121) shown in Table 2 have prognostic roles in colorectal cancer. In addition, while there is currently no literature report about the SNPs in Table 2 showing their biological functions or relation to health and disease, Regulome DB [25] data suggest that one of the SNPs, rs17026425, is located within the binding site of JUN/JUND transcription factors. Mammalian JUN family of transcriptional regulators includes c-JUN, JUNB, and JUND with important roles in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis (reviewed in [26]). According to our results, rs17026425 polymorphism was nominally associated with overall survival in rectal cancer sub-group (Table 2). Further studies on rs17026425 polymorphism may test its potential binding to the JUN family of transcription factors, its potential role in variable JUN function, and contribution to the rectal cancer formation and progression.","In conclusion, we performed genomewide SNP survival association studies in MSS/MSI-L, colon and rectal cancer patients. A limitation of this study is that all three patient cohorts investigated were characterized by small samples sizes, thus we cannot confidently conclude whether the investigated genetic markers indeed have no prognostic associations in colorectal cancer. However, this study also generated a small set of SNPs that may be an interest for other investigators in their future analyses."
