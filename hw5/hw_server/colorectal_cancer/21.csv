0,Impact of age on outcome after colorectal cancer surgery in the elderly - a developing country perspective,"Age has received increasing multidisciplinary attention as a prognostic factor for postoperative complications. Older age is associated with increasing co-morbid conditions, and suitability of surgical candidates based on age has traditionally been debated. The impact of age on postoperative outcome after major colorectal surgery (CRC) remains controversial. Age is a major risk factor for the development of cancer and the incidence of carcinomas increases with advancing age [1]. The incidence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum peaks in the seventh and eight decades of life, with only 5% recorded in those younger than 40 years [2].Older patients usually present with coexisting diseases and whether these patients are capable of enduring extensive gut resection or not, is a major decision the surgeon has to make. As a result, surgery for the treatment of CRC has been influenced by age [3]. Previous studies have shown that the rates of emergency presentation, inoperability and peri-operative mortality were high in elderly patients with colorectal cancer [4]. Such data might lead to withholding curative treatment with radical surgical procedures and opting for more ""conservative"" or palliative therapies in elderly patients. But many recent publications have encouraged the same surgical approach as for younger patients [5–7].The risks and benefits of surgery for CRC in old patients have not yet been clearly defined in Pakistan. Due to lack of local data elderly patients may be refused life saving surgery, with the assumption that the outcome will be poor; making surgery futile. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of age on colorectal cancer presentation, surgical management and early postoperative outcomes from a single institution of a developing country and to determine whether old age itself is a predictor of complications after colorectal cancer surgery.","Patients with pathologically confirmed Colorectal Cancer who underwent primary surgery at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi, Pakistan, between January 1999 and December 2008 were identified from medical records and their files were reviewed. AKUH is one of the largest private tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. With 563 beds it provides services to over 50,000 hospitalized patients and to over 600,000 outpatients annually. Despite the lack of a specific referral pattern in the country, a diverse group of patients from all over Pakistan seek healthcare at AKUH.Identified patients were divided into two groups on the basis of chronological age: ≥ 70 years (Group I, elderly patients) and < 70 years (Group II). There is lack of a consistent definition of old age in the literature. Authors have used a number of different cut offs ranging from 65 to 85 years in various studies [8–14]. According to the Ministry of Population Welfare of the Government of Pakistan, average life expectancy in Pakistan is 66.4 years [15]. Due to genetic and environmental factors South Asian's generally age faster than most western societies. In Pakistan a person is usually physically unable to cope with work by the age of 70. Based on these facts we used 70 years as threshold in our study. However we also performed sensitivity analysis using 65 and 60 years as a cut off.Clinical and pathologic characteristics of these cases were recorded with the help of a structured questionnaire including: patients demographics, associated co-morbids, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologist) levels, albumin levels for nutritional status, preoperative complications, mode of admission, site of tumor, TNM staging, number of lymph nodes positive for tumor metastasis, early postoperative complications and 30 day mortality. Based on the co-morbid conditions, Charlson's index was calculated for each patient [13]. Early post-operative morbidity was defined as complications developing within 30 days after the operation. They were classified into surgical (wound infection, anastomotic leak, abdominal sepsis/abscess, paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction) and systemic complications (postoperative urinary tract infection, difficulty in voiding, pneumonia, pleural effusion, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, systemic sepsis and stroke).Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 16.0). Descriptive statistics were computed for characteristics of patients, laboratory, tumor and postoperative morbidity and mortality. Fisher's exact test was used to compare patients above and below 70 years of age. Occurrences of early postoperative systemic and surgical complications were also compared between these groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed separately for systemic and surgical complications. We were unable to use mortality in a multivariate model owing to the small number of events (deaths = 6). Variables selected for multivariate analysis were age and an a priori list of clinically relevant variables.This research project was a retrospective review of medical records and in accordance with the ethical principles laid forth by the Declaration of Helsinki, retrospective reviews of medical records in which patient identifying information is not collected are exempt from formal ethical review by the ethical review committee of the Aga Khan University, the institution where the research was performed [16]. Being a review of 10 years of data consent from individual patients was not sought. No identifying information was recorded by the research team. All information was collected from the medical records and no questionnaire was administered to the patient.","A total of 271 patients underwent surgical treatment for pathologically confirmed primary colorectal cancer during the study period, out of which 56 patients were ≥ 70 years (Group I) and 215 were < 70 years old (Group II) at the time of surgery. An overall 16 surgeons performed surgeries over the 10 year study period. All of these were experienced consultants and we found no difference in the proportion of surgeries performed by surgeons in each group (p = 0.4)In Group I, 73.2% patients were male and the mean age was 75.6 years (range 70 to 88 years); whereas in Group II, 63.3% patients were male and the mean age was 50.1 years (range 15 - 69 years) (table 1). The most common site of tumor in elderly group was sigmoid colon (41%) followed by rectum (26.8%), compared to Group II where rectum (37.7%) was the most frequent site of tumor and sigmoid colon (16.7%) was second to it. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent type of tumor (Group I: 100%, Group II: 97.2%) and majority of the tumors were moderately differentiated (Group I: 80.4%, Group II: 65.1%). Stage IV tumors were more frequently noticed in Group I (7.1%) compared to Group II (4.7%). All these differences however, were non-significant between the two groups.Table 1 Presentation of colorectal cancer by age categoriesFull size table
No significant difference was noticed in the rate of overall preoperative complications (Group I: 83.9%, Group II: 86%, p = 0.68), the commonest complication being bowel obstruction (Group I: 17.9%, Group II: 11.6%, p = 0.21) (table 2). Rate of emergency presentation was also nearly similar (Group I: 17.9%, Group II: 12.1%, p = 0.25). Although surgeries with palliative intent were more frequently performed in elderly patients, the difference was not significant (Group I: 7.1%, Group II: 4.7%, p = 0.45); The most commonly performed surgeries were right hemicolectomy (26%), abdominoperenial resection (21%), sigmoid colectomy (6%) and low anterior resections (12%). Only 5 laparoscopic procedures were performed (Group I: 4 (2%), Group II: 1 (2%), p = 0.88). The rate of hypoalbuminemia was insignificantly high in Group I (p= 0.80). Presence of co-morbid conditions (Group I: 82.1%, Group II: 45.1%, p< 0.001), higher ASA levels (Group I: 53.6%, Group II: 28.4%, p< 0.001) and Charlson score of 3 and above (Group I: 96.4%, Group II: 11.6%, p< 0.001) were significantly more frequently recorded amongst elderly patients when compared to patients who were < 70 years old.Table 2 Comparison of pre-operative, operative and post operative variables between the two age groups in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancerFull size table
Postoperative complications occurred in 36.2% (n = 98) patients. In Group I, 41.1% patients developed postoperative complications compared to 34.9% of Group II (p = 0.39) (table 2). Upon cross tabulation, there was no significant difference in the development of postoperative surgical complications between the two groups (p= 0.39); however, systemic postoperative compilations differed significantly (Group I: 28.6%, Group II: 17.2%, p= 0.05). The postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 7.1% in Group I compared to 0.9% in Group II (p< 0.001).The difference in systemic complications by age disappeared upon multivariate analysis (table 3). Age was not associated with either systemic or surgical complications after adjusting for other factors (95% CIs = 0.32-1.66 and 0.63-3.62). Factors that significantly predicted higher systemic complications were tumor site, higher ASA score and pre-operative bowel perforation. Tumors in the rectum were 2.5 times more likely to have complications as compared to those in the colon (95% CI = 1.21-5.34). Patients with an ASA score of > 2 were 2.9 times more likely to have systemic complications than those with lesser scores (95% CI = 1.30-6.25). Pre-operative perforation was associated with a higher rate of both systemic and surgical complications with high odds ratios. Patients presenting with perforation were 9.7 times (95% CI = 1.94-48.0) and 8.3 times (95% CI = 1.72-39.7) more likely to have systemic and surgical complications respectively. Similar results were found when ages of 65 and 60 were used as cut offs to form the two groups. Age remained an insignificant covariate in the multivariate models.Table 3 Multivariate analysis of factors associated with post-operative complications in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancerFull size table
","A number of geriatric patients develop colorectal cancer, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group. Surgery, whether palliative or curative, is the treatment of choice for majority of patients with colorectal cancers. In the recent past, extensive surgical procedures in elderly patients seemed to be contraindicated because of poor functional status, associated co-morbids and impaired cognition [17]. However improved diagnostic procedures, intensive peri-operative care, better anesthesia and surgical techniques have made it possible to perform high risk surgical procedures in old age patients [18].Our study demonstrates that age alone is not a predictor of postoperative complications in a Pakistani population of patients with colorectal cancer. In a previous study we describe rates of complications and their management at our institution in greater detail [19]. A number of Western studies also demonstrate that age is not a predictor of post operative complications [5–7, 10–13, 20]; however, to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate these results in our region. Albeit the limitations of this study, it seems that even in our population colorectal surgery should not be deferred solely on the basis of age. Elderly patients have similar rates of morbidity and mortality as younger patients of the same clinical status.In our study postoperative surgical complication rates were nearly similar in both age groups. There was however a higher rate of postoperative systemic complications upon univariate analysis. Twenty eight percent of patients of age ≥ 70 years developed systemic complications after CRC surgery in our study which is comparable to previous studies [4, 21, 22]. An adjusted model clearly demonstrated that any effect of age on systemic complications was explained by other factors such as ASA score of the patient.Elderly patients usually have a higher risk profile [22–24]. This was also found in our analysis. Almost 82% of all patients in the ≥ 70 years old group had some co-morbid compared to 45% of younger age group (p < 0.001). This led to significantly higher ASA classification and more than 50% patients of ≥ 70 years old had an ASA score of 3 or above compared to 28.4% patients of < 70 year old group. Similarly significant differences were noticed in Charlson score between the two age groups. A number of studies have demonstrated an association of ASA class with early postoperative morbidity and mortality rates in patients undergoing surgery for CRC [20, 25, 26]. We found systemic complications to be three times more likely to occur in patients with an ASA of 3 or more.Postoperative mortality rate was 7.1% in the elderly group compared with 0.9% in those under 70 years old (p = 0.005). This significant increase in mortality rate in elderly is comparable to previous studies [6, 7, 11, 27, 28]. This higher mortality rate is very likely also due to other factors such as comorbids or pre-operative clinical condition. Five out of the 6 deaths occurred in our patients with an ASA class of > 2. Due to the small number of deaths (n = 6), we were unable to perform multivariate analysis with mortality as an outcome which would have demonstrated this clearly.There is an increasing trend in Western societies towards more curative treatment for elderly patients with colorectal cancer [18]. However this practice is unclear in developing countries and many elderly patients with CRC in countries like Pakistan still receive inadequate treatment solely based on their age. A number of predictive tools are available that assess risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery based on the comorbid and general health status of the elderly [29, 30]. It would be beneficial to test these tools on local populations and use these rather than age alone as criteria to select surgical treatment.This study was from a single institution and even though it is from a large number of patients with representation from all ethnic groups found in Pakistan, the generalizability may be limited. Further studies from other institutions are needed to substantiate our findings. The number of about 250 - 300 patients may seem less in comparison to Western studies, however health seeking behavior in our population differs. There is no screening program for CRC thus many such patients are never diagnosed nor treated appropriately. In addition AKUH is a private institution where patients pay out of their pocket to receive treatment which may account for the fewer patients. The number of patients in the elderly group is low at 56, this is not surprising as life expectancy in Pakistan is low at 65 and not many elderly patients seek surgical treatment. The study does however provide valuable evidence that could be used by surgeons in decision making and patient selection. Since the purpose of this study was to determine the independent effect of age on post operative complications, using a cut off of 70 years may be considered inadequate by some. As a secondary exercise we did perform the same analysis using different cut offs of age; 60 and 65 years. The results were the virtually same each time. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect (or lack of effect) of age alone and thus other significant variables in the final model were not explored or discussed. These could possibly be areas for further research."
1,Lynch Syndrome from a surgeon perspective: retrospective study of clinical impact of mismatch repair protein expression analysis in colorectal cancer patients less than 50 years old,"Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome [1], is an autosomal-dominant syndrome accounting for 3-5% of colorectal cancer cases [2, 3], predisposing to female reproductive and urinary tract cancers, as well as other extracolonic tumors [4, 5]. It is actually known that Lynch Syndrome is caused by an inherited or acquired mutation that inactivates one or more genes for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, which normally recognize the wrongly incorporated nucleotide and replace it with the correct one, leading to accumulation of cellular mutations and thus greatly increasing the likelihood of malignant transformation [6, 7]. Almost five DNA MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and PMS1) have been individuated as possible mutation sites, and their proteins unexpression or mutation, have been investigated as possible causes of Lynch Syndrome. Patients with MMR genes mutation and protein absence or inactivation have a lifetime risk of CRC of 70-80% if no regular endoscopic screening is performed, with a mean age of CRC diagnosis of 44 years [4].The diagnosis of Lynch Syndrome generally requires three steps, including a review of family history of cancer, the cancer specimen analysis and the genetic analysis, i.e. the determination of the primary DNA sequence of MMR genes [8–10]. In clinical practice, however, outside the families known to be affected by Lynch Syndrome, the most frequent situation is the unexpected diagnosis of colorectal neoplasm in a young patient, for which a treatment program should be scheduled as soon as possible, not allowing a proper genetic study before surgery. In these cases, if the patient is not correctly diagnosed as a Lynch Syndrome bearer, treatment may finally result inappropriate in terms of completeness of preoperative staging and extension of colonic removal.The aim of the present study is to determine if a preoperative diagnosis of HNPCC by MMR proteins expression analysis could affect treatment decisions, leading to a better management.","All colorectal resections for cancer performed at the Surgical Clinic of the University of Brescia in the period 1994-2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient entered into a scheduled program of clinical and instrumental follow-up. Our object was the comparison between patients under 50 years (Group A), and a sample of 85 randomly selected patients (which follow-up was recently updated for another study), more than 50 (included) years old (group B). The following parameters were recorded: age, sex, clinical presentation (symptomatic or not), operative treatment (resection of a colonic segment or extended surgery, including at least two segments or subtotal/total colectomy), cancer site (proximal to the transverse colon included, or distal), histotype (mucinous or not), staging (T1-2 or T3-4), grading (G1-2 or G3), disease-free and overall survival rates.In group A, immunohistochemical analysis on histological samples derived from preoperative endoscopic biopsies and/or removed pieces was performed, to determine the loss of expression of 3 MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6). After retrieving the paraffin blocks, 8 micron thick sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The slides were placed in a microwave oven for 5 minutes in jet mode (full power) twice, and 3 more times for 5 minutes at 750 W power and lastly incubated for 40 minutes. Anti-MLH1 Mouse antibody clone G168-15 BD, at 1:30 dilution (Biosciences CompanyTM, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, code 551092), anti-MSH2 Mouse antibody, clone G216-1129, at 1:20 dilution (Biosciences CompanyTM, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, code 556349) and the Anti-MSH6 Mouse antibody, clone 44 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.TM, San Francisco, California, USA, code 08-1374) have been employed. For antigen unmasking the EDTA buffer at pH 8, 0.1 M was used. Data about MMR were expressed as dichotomous variables (yes/no), even though in 8 cases a diagnostic doubt was due to an insufficient but not entirely absent expression of the protein. The cases with preserved expression were considered normal, those without expression (as well as those with diagnostic doubt) were not. In the present work it was not taken into account what has been previously demonstrated: the absent expression of MSH6 is associated in 5% of cases with impaired quality (but with normal immunohistochemical expression) of MSH2, in which case it would be useful to proceed with its genetic analysis [11–13]. Furthermore, in the present work we did not investigate micro satellite instability (MSI) and gene sequences of MMR.Patients with complete or partial lack of expression (group A1) were compared to patients with preserved expression (group A2) of one or more MMR protein, concerning clinical, pathological and survival features. In patients belonging to group A1, the personal and family history was deeply assessed, up to the previous second generation (brethren, parents, uncles, grandparents and grandparent’s brethren) and first subsequent generation (children and brethren’s children), in accordance with the Amsterdam II criteria [14]; for patients in which such informations were not clearly available from the analysis of medical supplies, telephone interviews were conducted. All the relatives in the 4 generations and the probands were investigated for every type of cancer, including previous and metachronous ones; colorectal polyps were considered as neoplasm if high-grade dysplasia was documented. All the interviews were done in 2010, from March to July, follow-up information being recorded up to 12/12/2009.Statistical analysis was performed by Chi square test for dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Survival curves were constructed with the actuarial model, and comparison between curves was carried out by the method of Mantel-Haenzn.This study was approved by the University Institutional Board Ethics Committee (Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences).","The entire series of colorectal resections for cancer in the period under investigation consists of 814 patients. Forty-nine patients less than 50 years old were identified (group A), with a mean age of 41 years; 27 were males and 22 females. Table 1 compares clinical and pathological features of Group A patients with those of patients older than 50 years (Group B); the former had a more frequently symptomatic tumor, the most reported symptoms being abdominal pain (43% of cases), bleeding (35% of cases), occlusion (14%) and palpable abdominal mass (8% of cases). Moreover, more undifferentiated tumors and advanced stages were identified in group A patients; however, the prognosis was not significantly different (Figure 1).Table 1

In group A, 31 wax blocks were retrieved from 49 patients; in 3 cases a final diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) was confirmed by genetic testing, while the remaining 15 cases were not available for reevaluation or were used for other investigations. In 8 patients out of 31 available cases, both endoscopic biopsies and surgical specimens were analyzed, and the 2 determinations were always concordant. Fifteen patients had a normal expression of MLH1, MSH2 and MLH6, 8 patients had a doubtful expression (25.8%), and 8 patients showed markedly deficient expression of at least one MMR protein (25.8%). The clinical features of the 16 patients considered as having altered immunohistochemical expression of MMR protein(s) are as follows: 5/16 patients (31.2%) belonged to Amsterdam and 16/16 patients belonged to Bethesda criteria (due to the inclusion in group A of only younger than 50 year old cases) [15, 16]; 8/16 patients (50%) had an association with other synchronous or metachronous extracolonic tumors; in 11/16 cases (68.7%) another colorectal cancer developed in the 4 generations analyzed for each patient; finally, 6/16 patients (37.5%) developed another subsequent colonic neoplasm (Table 2). A total of 37 cases of cancer were diagnosed, including colorectal (19), endometrium (6), breast (2), kidney (2), Vateri papilla (1), prostate (3), skin cancers (3) and lung (1).Table 2

","Colorectal cancer in Lynch Syndrome have distinctive clinical features that are well known in literature, such as younger age at presentation, proximal location, mucinous differentiation, advanced stage, associated extracolonic tumors and better stage-normalized prognosis [2, 6, 17]. However, even if well-known management guidelines are available, in daily clinical practice most frequently a diagnosis of colon cancer in a young patient is not immediately followed by a routine assessment for Lynch Syndrome - except in cases in which the diagnosis is made during a screening program in a family known for bearing the genetic mutation - thus patient does not receive specific treatment. In particular, the surgeon may not perform a more extensive surgery on the colon (total or subtotal colectomy [18]), eventually associated in women with prophylactic hysterectomy or hystero-ovariectomy, and may not look for synchronous extracolonic tumors [19, 20]. At most, the study is left to postoperative time. The main reason of this common practice is related to the delay of cure required to carry out proper genetic investigations. In fact, as demonstrated by this series of patients undergoing colonic resection for cancer before 50 years of age, in young patients the cancer is often symptomatic for abdominal pain, bleeding, obstruction or palpable abdominal mass (over 90% of our patients). Furthermore, waiting few weeks may be not tolerable from a psychological point of view. Thus, our series represents the current clinical practice, in which most frequently a correct recognition of Lynch Syndrome failed.Compared to patients older than 50 years, young patients (Group A) showed a statistically significant difference in the rate of undifferentiated and high stage tumors (Table 1). This is easily explained by the fact that colon cancer diagnosis are often late in young people, in a symptomatic stage. Accordingly, patients in group A seem to have a worse prognosis (not statistically significant, Figure 1). Other typical features of Lynch Syndrome (mucinous histology and proximal location), while more frequent, were not significantly represented in this group. The proportion of patients undergoing extensive surgery was also similar in groups A and B.The aim of the present work was therefore to analyze the expression of MMR proteins in young patients by immunohistochemical determination of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, in order to identify those actually belonging to a Lynch Syndrome family.A limited sample of 31 cases was available for the analysis. Out of these, 16 had a clearly deficient or absent expression of at least one MMR protein, and thus were HNPCC-related colorectal cancer cases (Group A1). This group is indeed more homogeneous than the whole group A regarding clinical characteristics of malignancies, as shown in Table 3: these patients had more frequently a proximal and mucinous tumor, and their prognosis was significantly worse than for group B (Figure 2); this is partly in disagreement with the literature, and may be explained by two reasons: first, all group A1 patients were diagnosed because of symptoms, thus with an advanced stage, while the data reported in the literature usually refer to patients known to be affected by Lynch Syndrome, thus including a relevant proportion of cases diagnosed through screening investigations; second, and perhaps more important, none of these patients received proper treatment, including early research and treatment of other cancers and extended colectomy to prevent colon cancer recurrence. Indeed, the difference in survival between A1 (< 50 years, MMR-) and A2 (<50 years, MMR+) remains significant because those groups are more homogenous, being both very young and having both a great proportion of advanced symptomatic cases.Analyzing in detail the clinical history, before and after the intervention, half of these 16 patients did previously have or subsequently developed other tumors; in particular 37.5% developed metachronous colonic tumors requiring redo-surgery. Only 1 out of 16 MMR deficient patients underwent a primary extended colectomy; 5 our of 15 patients receiving primary segmental resection subsequently developed a colonic recurrence. Prophylactic subtotal colectomy may be proposed as alternative to surveillance colonoscopy for individuals with confirmed mutations. Syngal and Collegues used a decision-analysis model to evaluate life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy in 25 years old patients with a confirmed mutation undergoing prophylactic surgery, compared with colonoscopy surveillance. They showed that, although both approaches offer only a modest survival benefit, immediate procto-colectomy or subtotal colectomy was superior to surveillance, with an expected gain in life expectancy of 15.6 and 15.3 years after the immediate proctocolectomy or subtotal colectomy respectively, compared with 13.5 years for surveillance [21]. In a recent paper, Parry and Colleagues found that 0% and 22% respectively of patients receiving extended and segmental colonic resection had a metachronous colorectal cancer, with a risk reduction of 31% (95% CI 12% to 46%; p = 0.002) for every 10 cm of bowel removed [18].These data clearly show at what extent a correct recognition of Lynch Syndrome may influence the management of affected patients, both in terms of diagnostic approach (including preoperative staging and follow-up) and surgical strategy. On the other hand, clinical diagnosis based on medical history, including a precise picture of the genealogical tree for at least four generations, referring to the Amsterdam and/or Bethesda criteria, seems from our study to be inadequate: we identified only 31% of HNPCC patients by Amsterdam criteria, while only about half of those who fulfilled Bethesda criteria (i.e. all our patients Group A) were affected by HNPCC. The immunohistochemical determination of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins has been simple, cheap and fast in this series. Moreover, according to our data, the biopsy samples can be used for this purpose in the preoperative period. In all the 8 cases in which the analysis was done both on preoperative biopsies and surgical specimen, there was a complete agreement in MMR proteins expression. Similar results have been recently reported by Warrier and Colleagues in a series of 33 germ-line positive mutation carriers patients in which the sensitivity of the endoscopic biopsy in predicting the germ-line status was 94.9% (95% CI 80.4-98.3) [22].Lack of PMS2 immunohistochemical analysis and MSI determination are main limitations of the present study; however, some recent proposal to reduce the number of MMR proteins analysis to lower costs in daily practice is appearing; for instance, Shia and Collegues provided evidence that a 2-antibody panel is as effective as the current 4-antibody panel in detecting DNA mismatch repair protein abnormalities [23]. MSI is a very useful diagnostic tool, complementary to the immunohistochemical determination of MMR proteins expression, and it can be conducted rapidly on the biopsy material too. Furthermore, MSI analysis has a 93% sensitivity in detecting MMR deficiency in MMR mutation carriers [24]. However, compared with MSI analysis, immunohistochemistry has the additional advantage of identifying the MMR gene which is most eligible for DNA analysis [25]. On the other hand, MMR proteins belong expressed in case of protein truncation, such as frame shift, splice site mutations and large genomic rearrangements: the abnormal protein may have a loss of function but be still detected with immunohistochemisty [11–13]. Furthermore, this work did not provide an implementation of genetic testing, which is considered time-consuming in the preoperative setting [15]."
2,Laparoscopic vs. open approach for colorectal cancer: evolution over time of minimal invasive surgery,"Despite the decreased incidence rates reported during last years, cancer remain the leading cause of death worldwide [1]. It has been reported that only a small part of cancers is genetically determined, and most of them is due to a biological response to environmental factors [2–6]. Interventions focused on primary prevention mostly regard tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary advices [7, 8], but the burden of the disease is far to be considered negligible. Regarding the therapeutic approaches, in the late '80s the successes of the laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder disease laid the foundations on the modern use of this surgical technique in a variety of diseases [9–14]. Among the most frequent benign and malignant disease which require a surgical therapy, colorectal cancer has reached the best results with a laparoscopic approach in terms of safety [15], reduced postoperative recovery [16], and improved long-term survival [17, 18].Thus, in the last 20 years, laparoscopic colorectal surgery had become a popular treatment option for colorectal cancer patients. Several clinical trials emphasized the aforementioned benefits stating the significant advantages of reduced blood loss, early return of intestinal motility, lower overall morbidity, and shorter duration of hospital stay in the laparoscopic-assisted group, leading to a general agreement on laparoscopic surgery as an alternative to conventional open surgery for colon cancer. However, despite the theoretical advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is still not considered the standard treatment for colorectal cancer patients due to technical limitations or characteristics of the patients that may affect short and long term outcomes [19]. Thus, the aim of this study is to review the main available evidences between the conventional open approach and laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer treatment.","Results about mean operating time of the laparoscopic-assisted procedure versus open surgery vary among studies, some reporting no significant differences between the two groups [20, 21] and others reporting a longer time for the laparoscopic-assisted procedure [22].The prolonged operative time for the laparoscopic procedure depend on the higher complexity of technical expertise involved in such technique. Given the technical difficulty of this treatment, reasons of such results may be depended by the need for experienced surgeons and a not well established manuality due to a consistent learning curve [23, 24]. Major difficulties of the laparoscopic colorectal surgery are due to work in multiple abdominal quadrants, control of vascular structures, creation of anastomosis, as well as retrieving large specimens in some patients whereas potential risks regard port-site recurrence after curative resection of tumor and incomplete lymph node dissection [25, 26]. More recent studies are reporting less significant differences according to this parameter thanks to the stabilization of the learning curve of the surgeon. Indeed, in most of the reports, the learning curve of the technique is incorporated during the study period and the skills were still evolving during the conduct of the study, thus is not surprising that as time passed, the surgeon's experience with the procedure increased as well, leading to a decrease of the operative time in the latter phase of the study period.Blood loss and analgesic requirement depend greatly on the degree of invasiveness of the surgical approach. Results of a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials revealed a significant increased reduction of intraoperative blood loss, number of blood transfusions, and abdominal bleeding in patients who underwent a laparoscopic colon resection compared with those operated with an open approach [27].","Early randomized controlled trials suggested that the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal surgeries were similar or barely better than the traditional open approach.With the establishment of the technique as a routine surgical approach, a study conducted in 48 institutions (namely including many surgeons) on 872 patients, reported that a greater experience of the surgeon (20 or more laparoscopic resections) was associated with longer operating time, but better outcomes such as lower intraoperative complications and shorter recovery time and hospital stay [28].The significant improvements in postoperative recovery among laparoscopic-treated patients regard mostly an earlier resumption of normal diet, shorter hospital stay, and earlier time to ambulation [20].However, comparison of length of hospital stay after surgery among studies may be affected by some confounding factors. For instance, socioeconomic status may lead to health care disparities in countries such as the US where insurance play an important role on health care of population. Thus, compared with countries in which the healthcare system provides ensuring equity in the availability of care by removing financial barriers for all patients, the hospital stay of colorectal cancer patients living in US has been reported to be shorter [29]. Taking into account such possible bias, a country-specific comparison of the length of hospital stay of the patients operated with the laparoscopic and open procedure still remain significantly different. Indeed, the postoperative hospital stay for patients who undergo the laparoscopic procedure has been reported to range between about 5 and 7 days in US [28, 30, 31] and slightly longer in countries in which care are free of charge for all patients [20], compared with 8 to 10 days for those who undergo open surgery.The benefits in short-term outcomes with laparoscopic resection has been also supported by the reports on perioperative immunologic response [32, 33]. In the early post-operative period, better reserved cellular immune responses such as higher levels of total lymphocytes, CD4 T cell, and CD8 T cell in laparoscopic resection compared with open resection was observed [34]. In some studies exploring the inflammatory response differences among different surgical techniques, the immunologically beneficial IFN-γ, produced by the principal effectors of cell-mediated immunity Th1 cells, seemed to have a more active presence following laparoscopic colectomy, potentially contributing to an immunologic ""advantage"" by counteracting ""harmful"" cytokines, such as IL-1 [35, 36]. Better preserved inflammatory function after surgery may reflect a reduction in operative trauma when the laparoscopic technique is compared with open procedures.","Body's immunologic function, especially cellular immunity, play a central role in preventing cancer recurrence immediately after surgery of oncological patients [37]. Since the laparoscopic approach limits the tissue trauma and lead to significant less physiologic alterations during the perioperative period, it has been hypothesized that this increased preservation of the immunologic function may be translated in better long-term oncologic outcomes and may be correlated with higher postoperative survival rates [38–40]. Although evidence from early basic science studies seems to be promising, results from human studies are contrasting.In terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, local or distant recurrence, and long-term quality of life for colon cancer, recent trials results did not show difference between the two groups, laparoscopic and laparotomy resection [41].Others multicentre and randomized trials have extended patient recruitment including individuals affected by rectal cancer, considering the same parameters [30, 42, 43].Taking into consideration the same data, some authors have performed some meta-analyses reporting generally equal long term outcomes [34, 44, 45]. Oncological safety of patients operated with laparoscopic approach strongly depends on the experience of the surgeon, that has been shown to lead to better long-term outcomes, even when comparing laparoscopic to open surgery [28, 30, 42]. The studies pointed out also the risk connected with conversion rates, which are indeed reduced by increasing the experience of the surgeon. Some reports suggested that the conversion to open does not affect the general patient long-term outcomes [46], whereas others have shown an increase in the morbidity of inpatients and related outcomes [47–49]. In most cases the conversion depends on advanced cancer stage or, among the most reported reasons, on technical difficulties, obesity, and intra-operatory complications, but since the adverse impact of conversion has been reported to affect the overall survival (and not the disease-free survival), this finding is not attributable to a surgeon-related factor [41].The problem with incision site recurrences is certainly not a new issue in surgical oncology, but it remains unclear whether if laparoscopy is significantly affected by this issue and what are the mechanisms responsible [50]. For this reason, during the operation, manipulation of the tumor must be avoided; this is possible thanks to the use of non-traumatic forceps but above all thanks to the technique used that provides the fixity of the intestine during the entire surgery, only at the end, its mobilization. The most risky moment is the opening of the abdominal portion for the extraction of the removed piece, during which also happens the deflating of the pneumoperitoneum. The rapid deflation of the pneumoperitoneum may determine the so called ""chimney effect"" consequently with neoplastic parietal dissemination and the trocar sites. These two events can be avoided using small steps such as the use of endobag and a gradual desufflation with a laparoscopic extractor fan. The volume and extension of the mass are elements that affect contamination of surgical instruments during surgery and the consequential dissemination of neoplastic cells because, when the mass grows on the intestinal serosa or has infiltrated the mesentery and the surrounding structures, contamination becomes inevitable [51–57].Previous trials reported higher recurrence rates among laparoscopic operated patients compared with those operated with the open approach (up to 80% within 12 months), but latest updates from large randomized control trials do not confirm such rates, reporting comparable results between the two techniques (ranging from 0.5% and 1.3%) [31, 54, 58].Incisional hernia and adhesions are also a cause of postoperative morbidity and predictors of long term adverse outcome. Regarding incisional hernia, it has been reported that laparoscopic technique may have some advantages compared with open surgery [59–61], due to the absence of a large abdominal wound [62, 63]. Moreover, some authors have reported lower rates of formation of adhesions and related complications in the laparoscopic compared with open group [64–68]."
