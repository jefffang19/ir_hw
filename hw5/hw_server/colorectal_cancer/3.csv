0,Immune status at pre-treatment impacts on progression-free survival of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line chemotherapy,"Immunological status in surgically resected specimens affects the outcome of ‘operable’ colorectal cancer patients. For example, a high number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, CD3+ cells, CD8+ cells, or CD45RO+ cells in a tumor is associated with improved prognosis. However, it has not been determined whether the immunological status in peripheral blood affects the outcome of ‘inoperable’ metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients. We investigated the impact of peripheral immunological status at pre-treatment on progression-free survival (PFS) of MCRC patients.","Peripheral blood was prospectively collected from consecutive MCRC patients (n=40) before they received a first-line chemotherapy. The quantity of each of 25 immune subsets, including monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC, defined as Lineage-CD14+CD11b+CD33+HLA-DRlow/-) and effector memory T cells (TEM, defined as CD3+CD4+ or CD8+CD45RA-CCR7-) was measured using multicolor-flow cytometry. The patients were divided into high (> median) and low (< median) groups based on the median value for each immune subset. PFS was compared between the two patient groups.","Of the 25 immune subsets quantified, we identified a high quantity of M-MDSC, a low quantity of CD4+ TEM, or a low quantity of CD8+ TEM as adverse prognostic factors for PFS. Thus, patients with high M-MDSC, low CD4+ TEM or low CD8+ TEM had significantly shorter PFS than those with low M-MDSC, high CD4+ TEM, or high CD8+ TEM, respectively (p=0.004, 0.005, and 0.002, respectively). Ten (25%) patients had three adverse factors, 11 (27.5 %) patients had 2, 8 (20%) patients had one, and 11 (27.5%) patients had none. Patients were classified into two distinct prognostic groups based on the number of adverse factors that were present in each patient. The presence of 2 or 3 adverse factors (n=21, 52.5%) correlated with significantly shorter PFS compared to the presence of no or 1 adverse factor (n=19, 47.5%) (p=0.00001). In addition, multivariate analysis showed that the presence of 2 or 3 adverse factors was an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (Hazard ratio, 10.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-35.9; p=0.0003) after adjustment for previously known prognostic factors.",These results suggest that peripheral immune status at pre-treatment impacts on the prognosis of MCRC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy.
1,Heterogeneity of cytotoxic T cell infiltration in breast and colorectal cancer,"The prognostic value of intra-tumoral cytotoxic T cells has been demonstrated in multiple tumor types. However, immune infiltrate heterogeneity can lead to potentially significant misrepresentations of marker prevalence in routine histological sections. We examined step sections of breast and colorectal cancer samples for CD8+ T cell prevalence by standard chromogenic immunohistochemistry to determine marker variability and inform practice of T cell biomarker assessment in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.","Serial sections were cut at approximately 25 um intervals from 13 primary colorectal and 12 breast carcinoma (8 ductal adenocarcinoma, 4 medullary) FFPE samples until blocks were exhausted and stained for CD8 using DAB-based chromogenic immunohistochemistry. Stained sections were digitally imaged and CD8+ lymphocytes within defined regions of interest (ROI) including the tumor and surrounding stroma were enumerated. Using a linear model/ANOVA framework, statistical analyses of CD8+ cell count variance between patients as well as between levels within a patient sample were performed. Means, medians, and dispersion values of percent CD8 positive cells (CD8 cells/total ROI cells) were calculated. Similarity of CD8 prevalence between slices of a given sample was measured by percent of variability accounted for by slice as a factor in a linear model and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) ranging from zero (no similarity) to 1 (identical).","The mean and median CD8+ cell percentages varied between breast ductal adenocarcinoma (mean 11.32%, median 6.35) and colonic adenocarcinoma samples (mean 3.91%, median 2.88%) and were highest in medullary breast carcinoma (mean 25.32%, median 18.55%). However, minimal variation in cytotoxic T cell counts between levels within any given tumor block was observed. Percent variability (%) in CD8 counts between step sections from colonic adenocarcinoma (0.1%), medullary breast carcinoma (0.1%) and ductal adenocarcinoma (0.1%) blocks were minor. ICC calculated for percent CD8 positive cells between levels of a sample was 0.99 for both tumor types. Resampling-based methods show CD8 as reliable marker for classifying patients as CD8-positive or negative over a range of cut-offs.","Our results show that CD8+ T cell distribution is highly homogeneous within a standard tissue sample in both colorectal and breast carcinomas. As such, cytotoxic CD8 T cell prevalence by immunohistochemistry on a single level can be considered representative of cytotoxic CD8 T cell infiltration for the entire tumor section within the block. These findings support the technical validity of biomarker strategies relying on CD8 immunohistochemistry in FFPE tumors."
2,Phase I study of alphaviral vector (AVX701) in colorectal cancer patients: comparison of immune responses in stage III and stage IV patients,"AVX701 is an alphaviral replicon particle vaccine expressing a modified carcinoembryonic antigen gene (CEA(6D)). We previously reported the preliminary results of a Phase I/II study of AVX701 in metastatic colorectal cancer patients (Morse, J Clin Invest. 2010; 120: 3234–3241). Herein, we now report long-term survival for these patients and compare their T cell and antibody responses with the immune responses in a new cohort of stage III colorectal cancer patients immunized similarly with AVX701.",Twenty-eight (28) heavily pretreated patients with predominantly stage IV colorectal cancer were enrolled to 3 dose levels of AVX701 (highest dose 4 × 108 IU i.m. every 3 weeks for 4 immunizations). Subsequently 6 patients with stage III colorectal cancer who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled to the same regimen. Peripheral blood from before and after all immunizations was analyzed for immune responses (IR): anti-CEA antibody by ELISA and CEA-specific T cells by ELISPOT.,"For the entire metastatic cohort (n=28; 23 deaths), median OS was 16 months, 95% CI (8, 25). In those treated at the highest dose (n=19; 14 deaths), there was a trend for a longer median OS among CEA-specific T cell (ELISPOT) immune responders vs nonresponders (not reached vs 13 mo, Log rank p=0.10). ELISA data were too sparse to study OS in the metastatic patients. The difference between maximum anti-CEA antibody (reciprocal) titer and baseline was significantly higher in the Stage III cohort (Normal Scores Test, 2-sided p=0.01) as was the proportion of patients exhibiting IR by ELISA (100% vs 45.1%; Chi-square p=0.02). In the stage III cohort, mean ELISPOT values were significantly higher (F-test p = 0.003) and the rate of CEA-specific T cell response by ELISPOT tended to be higher (67% and 30%; Exact Pearson Chi-square, p=0.16) than in the stage IV cohort.",T cell responses following immunization with AVX701 were associated with a trend for longer survival in patients with predominantly stage IV colorectal cancer. The magnitude of antibody response and rate of T cell response tended to be greater in the stage III than stage IV patients which may reflect a less immunosuppressive milieu in patients without measurable disease. We hypothesize that future combinations with checkpoint blockade may enhance efficacy in more immunosuppressive environments.
3,Reovirus activated NK cells show enhanced cetuximab mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cells,"The naturally occurring oncolytic virus, reovirus, exhibits cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Reovirus is safe, and currently is in multiple clinical trials testing for the treatment of different cancers. NK cells are innate immune effectors that mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells.","Here we investigated the direct effect of reovirus on NK cell mediated ADCC against the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor) positive colorectal cancer cell line: DLD-1 (KRAS mut). NK cells isolated from human PBMCs were cultured with 1pfu of reovirus for 12 hrs. These reovirus treated NK cells were co-cultured with DLD-1 cells coated with increasing concentrations anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab. ADCC was measured after 4hrs using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) based cytotoxicity assay. We observed that the reovirus treated NK cells (Reo-NK cells) exhibited a ~16-fold increase in cytotoxicity against DLD-1 (16.3% ±1.5, n=3) compared to untreated NK cells (NK cells), even in the absence of any cetuximab antibody. In the presence of cetuximab antibody, NK cells showed a dose dependent increase in ADCC, with maximum ADCC, observed at 0.1 µg/ml of cetuximab (DLD-NK: 33.4%± 7.1, n=3). Interestingly, Reo-NK cells showed maximum ADCC even at 0.01 µg/ml of cetuximab (DLD1-Reo-NK: 39.1±7.4, DLD1-NK: 26.7±2.4%, n=3).","To further investigate the factors contributing to the increased cytotoxic potential of Reo-NK cells we performed flow cytometry analysis to determine the expression of activation and degranulation markers on NK cells. We observed that in presence of tumor cells Reo-NK cells exhibited a 2-fold increased expression of activation marker CD69 when compared to untreated NK cells (Reo-NK-70.4%, NK-35.2%). There was a 3-fold increase in expression of CD107a on Reo-NK cells when compared to NK cells (Reo-NK: 14.6%; NK: 4.45%). Further, treating Reo-NK and NK cells with concanamycin A (CMA), an inhibitor of perforin, reduced Reo-NK cell mediated ADCC by 3.17 fold (CMA treated-28.2%, CMA untreated 18.9%) indicating a perforin-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to the increased cytotoxicity of Reo-NK cells. Interestingly, UV attenuated reovirus failed to increase activation and ADCC of NK cells.","Thus, our results demonstrate that reovirus treatement activated NK cells, and lowered the threshold of cetuximab required to achieve maximum ADCC. We propose that reovirus activated NK cells are a potential candidate for cell based immunotherapy in combination with FDA approved tumor targeting antibodies. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the increase in cytotoxicity by NK cells treated with reovirus."
4,A CD4/Foxp3/OX40 triple immunofluorescence assay determines association between T cell immune subsets and outcome in colorectal cancer,"Increased numbers of OX40+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have been associated with improved outcome. However, the OX40+ T cell population is heterogeneous and includes, among others, CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as CD4+Foxp3- effector T cells (Teff). In this study, we used a novel triple immunofluorescence assay for CD4, FoxP3 and OX40 to determine the relationship between tumor-associated CD4+ T cell subsets and patient disease stage as well as outcome in CRC.","We investigated OX40 expression in tumor-associated CD4+ T cell subsets in 48 CRC patients including primary site (n = 48) and matched metastases (n = 19) with a triple immunofluorescence assay for CD4/FOXP3/OX40. Stained sections were digitally imaged and single, double and triple-positive tumor-associated cell subsets were enumerated and associations between CD4 subsets and stage and outcome as well as that of CD4 subsets between primary site and metastases were determined.","Mean counts of total OX40+cells (p = 0.005), OX40+ Treg cells (p = 0.006), and OX40+ Teff (p = 0.019) cells showed statistically significant inverse correlation with increased stage at diagnosis. Associations remained statistically significant when counts were normalized to total cells. Total CD4+ or Foxp3+ cells did not show significant association with stage. Analysis of paired primary and metastatic samples (n = 19) showed strong correlation between primary and met positive counts for CD4 (r = 0.75), total OX40+ (r = 0.84) as well as OX40+ Treg (0.52) and OX40+Teff (r = 0.85) subsets. These associations remained strong when counts were normalized to total cells. Increase in prevalence of CD4+ (p = 0.019), total OX40+ (p = 0.046), and OX40+ Treg (p = 0.022) correlated with improved overall survival. Higher prevalence of OX40+ Teff cells also showed a trend of improved overall survival, but did not reach statistical significance.","We have developed a multiplex immunofluorescence test to evaluate expression of OX40 in CD4+ T cell subsets and utilized it to determine associations between OX40+ cell subsets and clinical outcome. Our results show that higher number of total OX40+ cells and OX40+ Treg cells is associated with improved prognosis in CRC. Similar analyses in other indications are planned. Moreover, incorporating this test in clinical trials may identify patients that are likely to respond to therapeutics targeting OX40."
5,The prevalence of CMV and EBV among the patients with the colorectal cancer; a molecular approach,"Nowadays, colorectal cancer is known as one of the most common types of gastrointestinal cancer with high mortality rate worldwide. Recently, the association between the development of the cancer and viral infections has been widely investigated with controversial results. The current study was conducted to detect the association of CMV and EBV prevalence with colorectal cancer in the respective patients, and compare the prevalence rates of the two conditions between patients and healthy individuals.","A total of 80 tissue blocks (58 from colon and 22 from rectum) of the patients with colorectal cancer and 80 samples (58 from colon and 22 from rectum) from normal counterparts were obtained. The block samples were deparaffinized and the viral DNA was extracted using a commercially available kit. CMV and EBV nucleic acids were detected by nested-PCR method using specific outer and inner primer sets. The results were statistically compared between different groups by SPSS for Windows (version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).","CMV DNA was detected in 7/80 (8.7%) of patients; all in colon cancer group. Furthermore, EBV DNA was detected in 70/80 (87.5%) of patients, consisting of 50/58 (5%) with colon cancer and 20/22 (90.9%) with rectum cancer. Among the healthy individuals, the CMV and EBV nucleic acids were detected in 4/80 (5%) and 65/80 (81.25%), respectively. The statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the prevalence rates of CMV and EBV infections in cancer patients and the healthy group (p > 0.05).","Taken together, our findings revealed that the prevalence rates of both CMV and EBV infections were higher in colorectal cancer group than those in the normal one, though the differences were not statistically significant among them. Given the importance of the viral infections in the incidence of colorectal cancers, to reduce the infection complications in the cancer patients, a screening program is highly suggested.Figure 1Table 1 Analysis of EBV infection prevalence among different studied groups.Full size tableTable 2 Analysis of CMV infection prevalence among different studied groups.Full size table"
6,P15. A genetic mouse model to identify the role of the immune adapter protein MyD88 in colorectal cancer,"Pattern recognition receptors from the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are pivotal components of innate immunity, and have been shown to contribute to colon cancer formation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TLR-signaling in colon cancer remain unclear. The adapter protein Myeloid-differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is shared between several TLRs and the Interleukin-1 receptor family. MyD88-deficiency protects mice from intestinal cancer formation in genetic models for colon cancer. The genetic mouse model presented here allows tissue-specific expression of MyD88, and thereby the dissection of the complex interaction between tumour and immune system during intestinal carcinogenesis.","Insertion of an 'intron-gene-trap' flanked with loxP motifs into the first intron of the MyD88 gene locus leads to global inactivation of myD88 expression (MyD88LSL), faithfully phenotyping a global gene knock-out. Tissue-specific re-expression of MyD88 in mice is mediated based on the Cre-recombinase. Breeding of MyD88LSL mice with LysMCre or pvillin-Cre mice leads to tissue-specific excision of the 'intron-gene-trap', retaining endogenous regulation of gene expression. MyD88 expression and successful reconstitution of TLR-signaling was detected in either myeloid cells (MyD88MYEL) or intestinal epithelial cells (MyD88IEC). Subsequently, these animals were mated with Apc1638N/+ mice, an established genetic mouse model for human colon cancer.","Global MyD88 deficiency dramatically decreased tumour incidence and aggressiveness in Apc1638N/+ mice. Re-expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells only partially restored tumor formation. On the other hand, reconstitution of MyD88 expression in myeloid cells triggered tumour development virtually indistinguishable from parental Apc1638N/+ mice. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, induced by loss of function of Apc, was independent of MyD88. In contrast, MyD88 expression was required for full activation of MAPK/ERK signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, our results suggest a pro-tumorigenic function for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6, which were produced in a MyD88-dependent fashion by myeloid cells.","MyD88-mediated signaling has pro-tumorigenic effects in both IECs and in myeloid cells, but via different mechanisms. Moreover, MyD88 function in myeloid cells is crucial for intestinal tumour development, and its inhibition may form a promising therapeutic strategy."
7,Colorectal cancer patients show decrease in cellular immunity and enhanced plasma level of transforming growth factor – beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. The cause of high mortality is that almost half the cancers are detected at an advanced stage of disease. In addition to surgical and chemotherapy treatment in recent years, applied monoclonal antibody therapy may target against growth factors, and particularly against the receptors for growth factors. In clinical practice, an antibody against vascular endotelial growth factor (VEGF) - bevacizumab-is already used. VEGF is the factor responsible for neoangiogenesis and it was considered as a possible prognostic marker of disease progression. The correlation of higher levels of VEGF with the response to applied therapy, disease progress levels and a poor prognosis in patients with solid tumors is recently discussed. Transforming growth factor - beta (Transforming growth factor - beta, TGF-beta) is also neoangiogenetic and highly immunosuppressive factor. TGF-beta suppresses natural immunity against tumors. The TGF is considered as another possible prognostic marker of disease progression.The purpose of the study was to monitor immune responses in patients with colorectal cancer, particularly the examination of cellular as well as humoral immunity. TGF beta, and VEGF production was monitored.","19 patients included in the research project were implemented routine cancer teratment, including bevacizumab. Basic parameters (histological type and grade, proliferative marker) were established. Patients were evaluated by a cancer clinical immunologist to exclude immune disorders, allergic or autoimmune origin. TGF-beta, VEGF were mesured by ELISA and anti-tumor cellular immunity (CD4, CD8, B cells) were measured by flow cytometry.","In patients with colorectal cancer mainly depression in cellular immunity was found. Immunglobulin plasma level was dicreased as well (mainly IgG4 subtype). Most patients have shown clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency (frequent infections of respiratory tract, herpetic infections) TGF beta as well as VEGF plasma level were increased.",Correlation of these factors and the state of anticancer immunity could help in the future as a marker and contribute to the selection of targeted immune therapy in patients with colorectal cancer.
8,Combined low-FOXP3+ and -CD3+tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: a signature of stage II MSS colorectal cancer at high-risk of recurrence,"Low densities of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) predict colorectal cancer (CRC) post-surgical recurrence, the likelihood of progression also depending upon tumor stage and microsatellite (MS) status. We benchmarked FoxP3+TIL and CD3+TIL densities as predictor of postsurgical recurrence.","FoxP3+ and CD3+TIL densities were measured as the percentage of immune-reactive area (IRA%) at the tumor invasion front, in a consecutive series of 413 patients (pts) undergone radical surgery for pT3-pT4, stage II (n=211) and III (n=202) CRC, characterized for MS status. Recursive partitioning, as well logistic univariate, interaction, and multivariate analysis were employed for the integrated examination of pathological and immune markers in predicting recurrence.","In a recursive classification tree, nodal status was the main prognostic factor, discriminating higher recurrence rate for stage III (70/202; 34.7%;) than for stage II (32/211, 15.2% P<.001) pts. Within stage II, 0.23%FoxP3+IRA cut-off divided recurrences in 8/127 (6.3%) pts with high (>0.23%) FoxP3+TILs, and in 24/84 (28.6%; P<.001) pts with low (≤0.23%) FoxP3+TILs. Within the latter group, CD3+IRA% further branched recurrences, that occurred in 7/39 (15.2%) pts with IRA>1.86%, but in 17/38 (44.7%; P=.003) pts with less IRA%. Differently, TIL densities did not predict recurrence in stage III. Interaction analysis revealed that the prognostic effects of FoxP3+and CD3+TIL densities were significantly (P<0.05) modified by nodal and MS-status status. ROC curve analysis in stage II pts with MSS CRC confirmed the cut-offs identified by recursive partitioning. At multivariate, low (<0.23%IRA) FoxP3+ and (<1.86% IRA) CD3+TILs were both independent recurrence predictors (O.R, 10.22 and 7.85, respectively; both P<.001), and concomitant low-FoxP3+ and -CD3+TILs conferred the highest recurrence risk (O.R. 12.64; P<.001). Among stage II pts, the low-FoxP3+ and -CD3+TIL signature identified 61% (17/28) of all MSS CRC recurrences, representing 71% (17/24) of post-surgical metastasis (O.R. 18.43; 95%C.I. 6.68-50.86), while none of 58 pts with high-FoxP3+ and -CD3+TIL experienced recurrences.","FoxP3+ and CD3+TIL amount, plus tumor MS status efficiently stratify the risk of relapse of stage II CRCs, and may help in tailoring the post-surgical management of patients."
9,Does age influence results of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer in elderly patients?,The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the safety of laparoscopic resections for colorectal cancer in elderly patients (age ≥65 years) and to determine the oncological radicality and the benefits in the postoperative outcome.,"Consecutive 87 patients who had laparoscopic resection of right colon, left colon, sigma and/or supraperitoneal rectum for colorectal carcinoma or adenoma with medium/severe dysplasia from June 2005 to August 2008 were included. Two age-matched cohorts of patients were compared: 45 patients (group 1) of 65 years or older and 42 patients younger than 65. All of the patients underwent preoperative exams, colonoscopy with multiple biopsy and CT-scan, and all data concerning demographics, disease, details of operations and postoperative events were collected prospectively.","With regard to oncological radicality, resection margins were free from neoplastic infiltration (R0) in all cases and mean number of lymph nodes retrieved was 21.8 ± 10.7 in group 1 and 21.2 ± 11.4 in group 2 (p > 0.05).Mean operating time resulted 164 ± 39 minutes in the elderly group and 160 ± 32 minutes in the younger group (p > 0.05). Three patients of elderly group required conversion to laparotomy.Elderly patients presented resumption to oral diet after 3.7 ± 1.8 days whereas younger patients after 3.1 ± 1.4 days (p > 0.05) and also the return of bowel function was similar between the two groups, 2.5 ± 1.2 days in group 1 versus 2.3 ± 1.2 days in group 2 (p > 0.05).The length of hospital stay was similar between the two groups (8.7 ± 3.4 days versus 7.9 ± 4.8) (p > 0.05). Ten patients of group 1 presented postoperative morbidity whereas four postoperative complications occurred in the group 2.Two patients of elderly group died whereas there was no mortality in the younger group. One patient died for cardiac failure and the second case for MOF.","Our prospective study suggests, according to other studies, that laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a safe and effective option even for the elderly patients with similar oncological radicality and postoperative outcome as in younger patients."
10,Is total colectomy for colorectal cancer contraindicated in elderly patients?,"More and more frequently elderly patients are operated on for colorectal cancer (CRC). Total colectomy is indicated in selected cases such as synchronous tumors, cancer in FAP, HNPCC, emergency. We evaluated the impact of the age risk factor on patients’ outcome after total colectomy for cancer.","We reviewed our series concerning 27 patients submitted to total colectomy for CRC between January 2000 and September 2010. Indications were: synchronous tumors, cancer in FAP, HNPCC, and emergency. We divided them into two groups according to their age: 11 (40.7%) < 65 years (Group A) and 16 (59.3%) ≥ 65 years (Group B). For both groups the following preoperative parameters were investigated: emergency/elective surgery, comorbidity, smoke abuse, ASA score, and surgical operation. Postoperative course related to systemic (pulmonary, cardiac, renal and liver failure, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infections) and specific surgical complications (anastomotic dehiscence, hemorrhage, postoperative anemia, wound infection, prolonged ileus >3 days) were compared in two groups.","Comorbidity was higher in older patients. We found a different distribution of ASA scores in the two groups: in the first group 5 (45.5%) patients had score ≤ 2, while 6 (54.5%) patients presented score ≥ 3; in the second group 10 (62.5%) patients presented score 3, while 6 (37.5%) patients had score 4.We performed 2 (7.4%) total proctocolectomy and permanent ileostomy; 1 (3.7%) restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA); 24 (88.9%) total colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA). We observed 1 hemorrhage in a patient belonging to group A with ASA score 2. Systemic complications were higher in group B. We did not observe significant differences for surgical complications but for postoperative anemia (more frequent in group B). Average hospital stay was similar (11.2 days vs 12.8 days). Mortality [2/27 (7.4%), in group B (2/16-12.5%)] was not statistically significant.","After total colectomy for CRC we observed slightly higher postoperative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. However our morbidity, mostly due to systemic complications, was acceptable and depended on a greater presence of preoperative risk factors. In conclusion we believe that, after an accurate preoperative evaluation, the age is not a contraindication for total colectomy."
