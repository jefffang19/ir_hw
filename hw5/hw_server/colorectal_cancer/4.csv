0,Thermic ablation with RF of liver metastases from colorectal cancer,"Despite advances in screening procedures and the use of adjuvant therapy, approximately 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease. Surgical resection is now well accepted as the standard treatment for the liver metastases from colorectal cancer but tumour ablative techniques have been developed in recent years. The goal is to use them in patients with hepatic metastases, which are not totally resectable.Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of the hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC).","From November 2005 to July 2007 49 radiofrequency ablations have been performed in 19 patients (11 male and 8 female; mean age 65 years: range 50–78 years). The disease-free period was between 5 and 32 months. Hepatic nodules had a diameter inferior to 3 cm in 4 cases, while in 3 cases a single lesion was present. One patient had a single lesion after 2 courses of intravenous systemic chemotherapy, which had a reduced greater lesion (from 6 to 3 cm) while a 2 cm lesion had disappeared. In the remaining 12 patients the mean number of lesions is 3 (range 1–13) with a diameter between 3 and 12 cm. The radiofrequency ablation has been performed during laparotomy and vascular exclusion through clampage of the liver hilum in 4 cases and percutaneously under ultrasound guide in the remaining 15 cases.All patients underwent follow up by CT scan, CEA level and ultrasound every 3 months.",One patient only has completed a 4 year follow up and is alive without local recurrence but with a cerebral metastasis. The other 18 patients have a 32 months follow-up with a survival of 50% (9 on 18).,"Percutaneous, image guided, tumour ablation with thermal energy source, microwaves or laser has received increasing attention permitting the destruction of tumours without necessitating their removal and in many cases can be used in place of invasive and expensive techniques.Radiofrequency current, converted into heat through ion agitation and friction, can destroy liver tumours by means of coagulation necrosis.In clinical grounds RF ablation has been used for the treatment of different neoplasms including osteoid osteoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cells carcinoma, hyperfunctioning adenoma and hepatic, cerebral and retroperitoneal metastases from several primary tumours.In conclusion in our experience the radiofrequency ablation is a valid alternative method in the treatment of the hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer."
1,Our experience in surgery for colorectal cancer in elderly patients,"The effectiveness of surgery for colorectal cancer depends on it being carried out safely, which allows most patients to return to productive lives. Since colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly people [1], this study was designed to evaluate the outcomes of surgery in elderly patients.","In the period 1973-2003, in our institution, we surgically managed 931 patients for colorectal cancer; 48 patients, 28 males and 20 females, aged 80 years and over (mean age 83.7 years). The tumor was located in the left colon in 20 cases (41.6%), in the rectum in 11 (22.9%) and in the right colon in 17 patients (35.4%). 33 patients (68.7%) were treated with colonic resection and primary anastomosis, 8 (16.6%) with Hartmann resection, 5 (10.4%) with colostomy, 1 (2%) with abdominal perineal resection and 1 (2%) with anastomosis between ileum and transverse colon without resection. The stage was A in 7 patients, B in 22, C in12 and D in 7.","The operative mortality rate was 0. The infection of the surgical wound occurred in 10 patients, whereas 4 cases of bronchopneumonia took place (8.3%). We had also registered 1 anastomotic leak in a male patient with left colon cancer (2.08%). The median hospital stay was 13.1 days (range 9-22 days) and the 5 year survival was 56.2% (27/48). No patients had adjuvant therapy","This study demonstrates that surgery should not be denied to elderly patients with colorectal cancer; age is not a limitation for surgery, tumour stage and co-morbidity define the surgical treatment [2]. The morbidity and mortality figures for elective procedures are not different from the younger age population and favourable long-term outcome can be achieved by resectional surgery [3]. Diagnostic methods, rate of curative operations performed, staging, morbidity rate and 5-year survival rate are similar to younger patients. Finally the behaviour of colorectal carcinoma does not change with age and the age has no effect on the long-term survival of elderly patients."
2,The surgical treatment of colorectal cancer in patients over seventy-five years old. Risk factor analysis in patients operated in election and in emergency,"The colorectal cancer has a high incidence and mortality in the geriatric population. However the advanced age does not represent a contraindication for the surgery, and a radical cancer surgical treatment guarantees the same life expectation of younger patients. In this study we analyzed the correlation between comorbidities, postoperative complications and mortality.","In our retrospective study we analyzed the clinical notes of 66 patients over 75 years.We assessed the risk factors of the surgical treatment in the elective and emergency management. Among the 47 patients electively treated, 33 were affected by cardiocirculatory diseases, 23 by kidney diseases, 14 by metabolic and endocrine diseases, and 11 patients by respiratory diseases. In the 19 patients, who underwent emergency surgery, 75% had intestinal obstruction, and 25% had intestinal perforation.In election were performed 14 anterior resection of rectum, 7 abdomino-perineal resections, 4 Hartmann procedures, 11 left hemicolectomies, 8 right hemicolectemies and 3 explorative laparotomies. In emergency were performed 5 ileostomies, 3 colostomies, 5 left hemicolectomies, 3 right hemicolectomies, 2 Hartmann procedures, and 1 explorative laparotomy.","In elective surgery the complications were represented by suppuration of surgical wound (21.2% of cases), cystitis (21.2% of cases), bronchopneumonia (6.3% of cases), dehiscence of the anastomosis (2.1% of cases), thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs (2.1% of cases). In emergency the complications were represented by suppuration of the surgical wound in 60% of cases, arrhythmias in 21% of cases, and acute renal failure in 5%. In both elective and emergency surgery for patients without comorbidities there were not deaths. The mortality in patients with comorbidities was 2.1% in elective surgery and 26.5% in emergency surgery.In election the comorbidities strictly related to the post-operative complications and mortality were the renal diseases, while the cardiocirculatory diseases influenced on post-operative complications only.Contrary, in emergency the cardiocirculatory diseases influenced significantly the post-operative complications and mortality, while the renal diseases influenced only the post-operative complications.","The colorectal cancer in advanced age does not present different characteristics from younger age. Because of the more accurate pre-operative and post-operative therapies it is possible to give geriatric patient the same radical surgery as younger patients. Particularly in elective surgery, thanks to an adequate preoperative preparation, the comorbidities can be corrected ensuring the same prognostic result of younger patients. Contrary in emergency, a considerable disagreement persists in terms of prognosis between geriatric patients and younger patients. This is related to the impossibility of performing an adequate pre-operatory preparation."
3,Predictive value of IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels in anastomotic leakage in elderly patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer,"Elderly patients undergo surgery for colorectal cancer more often than younger patients because of the incidence and prevalence of colon and rectal cancer (CRC).Anastomotic leakage is the most feared complication after surgery because it impairs postoperative survival, disease free survival rate and recurrence.A recent meta-analysis shows that interleukin IL-6 and IL-10 intraperitoneal levels may be a useful marker to predict the likelihood to anastomotic leakage. Furthermore, the variations of cytokines levels are similar both in serum and intraperitoneal fluid, despite there is a quantitative difference between peritoneal and systemic concentrations.For this reason in our Department a prospective study is ongoing to assess if systemic interleukin IL-6 and Il-10 are a reliable marker to predict anastomotic leakage.","The study group is yet represented by 33 patients: 17 males and 16 females (median age 76, range 70–89). The location of cancer was respectively: 5 (15, 15%) in the rectum, 15 (45, 45%) in the left colon, 11 (33, 33%) in the right colon, 1 (3, 3%) in the transverse colon, 1 (3, 3%) synchronous in the caecum and the sigmoid colon.The associated diseases observed were: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease arterial vasculopathy.The surgical operations performed were respectively: 11 left colectomies, 8 right colectomies, 2 subtotal colectomies, 6 segmental resections, 3 anterior resections, 1 bypass anastomosis, 2 abdominoperineal excisions. In our study group we made 31 digestive anastomoses.Systemic measurements of IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytes and serum albumin were performed with ELISA in the preoperative period (t0), in the first (t1) and seventh postoperative day (t2).","In the study group 32 anastomoses were made and we observed only one (3.2%) anastomotic leakage. The CRP serum levels (mg/l) were: t0 24.63 ± 4.17, t1 25.62 ± 5.63, t2 21.5 ± 4.41 in complicated patients and t0 24.64 ± 5.18, t1 24.4 ± 7.15, t2 22.4 ± 7.99 in uncomplicated ones. IL-6 serum levels (pg/ml) were: t0 8.13 ± 3.31, t1 145.87 ± 88.62, t2 19.75 ± 23.56 in complicated patients and t0 6.74 ± 4.9, t1 118.36 ± 57.64, t2 19.32 ± 15.08 in uncomplicated ones. IL-10 serum levels (pg/ml) were: t0 4.63 ± 2.13, t1 19.52 ± 8.38, t2 5.75 ± 4.23 in complicated patients and t0 16.92 ± 18.10, t1 20.28 ± 18.18, t2 5.2 ± 2.61 in uncomplicated ones. Albumin serum levels (g/dl) were: t0 3.68 ± 0.42, t1 2.34 ± 0.70, t2 2.85 ± 0.83 in complicated patients and t0 3.71 ± 0.60, t1 2.82 ± 0.54, t2 3.30 ± 0.53 in uncomplicated ones. Lymphocytes (n°/μl) were. T0 2315.7 ± 854.5, t1 864.28 ± 404.18, t2 1502.85 ± 441.57 in complicated patients and t0 1580 ± 684.79, t1 920 ± 407.55, t2 1312.30 ± 415.15 in uncomplicated ones. These values and their variations are showed in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.Figure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5","Recent studies show that preoperative IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels are higher in patients with colorectal cancer than in control patients.Our study is still ongoing and it suggests that the measurement of cytokines serum levels is not useful in predicting anastomotic leakage. Despite this, we want to investigate, in particular, the role of IL-10. This cytokine influences the T-helper linked immunological response (suppression activity) and it may have a role in favoring anastomotic leakage. However, because the study is still ongoing, we need to evaluate more data to investigate the role of cytokines in anastomotic leakage."
4,N0 colorectal cancer in the elderly: prognostic role of advanced age and correlation with adjuvant chemotherapy,The aim of this study is to assess the possible prognostic role of age in the risk of relapse in patients operated for N0 colorectal cancer and if this role is confirmed in a control population who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy.,"129 patients who underwent radical surgery for N0 colorectal cancer were selected and grouped into three age classes: <65 years, between 65 and 80, >80.A subpopulation of 44 patients with colorectal cancer in stage II was selected from the initial group for a comparison with a control population consisting of 63 patients who underwent radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for neoplasms at the same stage.","In the population of 129 patients, the only significant correlation between age and clinical-pathological features is between advanced age (>80yr) and tumor location in the right colon (53.7%, p=0.04).Risk of relapse is related both to depth of tumor invasion (42.9% in stage T4, 6.3% in stage T1, p=0.01) and advanced age (19.5% in >80yr, 4% in <65yr).Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) are significantly lower in patients aged over 80 than the other two classes. This significance is maintained by stratifying the 129 patients in the two age classes (<70, >70).In the multivariate analysis age > 80yr is significantly correlated with an increased risk of relapse.Evaluating the control group no significant correlation between relapse and clinical-pathological features was detected.In the multivariate analysis in stage II population, advanced age doesn’t play any significant prognostic role in the risk of recurrence, while a reduction in DFS is related to depth of tumor invasion and the number of examined lymph nodes (<12).","The negative prognostic role of advanced age in the risk of relapse that emerges from the first part of the study is certainly related to the increased fragility of elderly patients, which might be caused by several pathophysiological factors hypothesized by several Authors, but does not appear to be a controindication for surgery.The comparison between only-operated patients and control ones in stage II neoplasm doesn’t show a prognostic role for advanced age in the risk of relapse.This could be attributed to several factors, first of all the lack of subjects enrolled in the study, because of the controversial role of age in stage II candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.However we cannot exclude that adjuvant chemotherapy could affect the role of age as a prognostic factor."
5,The role of surgery for colorectal cancer in octogenarians,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer for both sexes; prognosis of CRC is strictly related with stage. Previous studies have suggested that elderly patients do not fare well after surgery for CRC, with high rates of emergency presentations, inoperability and perioperative mortality and decreased overall survival. Recent reports, however, have recommended applying the standard surgical approach in the elderly. The aim of our study was to assess the characteristics and perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients following CRC surgery and to analyse the specific outcomes in the elderly.","From July 2003 to December 2007 we retrospectively analyzed 499 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for CRC at our Institution. Risk factors included sex, age, cancer localization, Dukes' and TNM classification, blood transfusion, and mode of presentation. Primary outcome was perioperative death.","The study consisted of 268 men and 231 women with a mean age of 77.4 years. 248 patients (57%) were more than 75 years of age. The latter had tumors that were predominantly right-sided in location with a high incidence of advanced Dukes' stage tumors. Moreover, larger number of these elderly patients presents as emergencies (10.5% Vs 4.6%). We have registered a preoperative mortality score of 1.9% in elective procedures and 15% in emergencies with differences among the age groups (p = Not Significant).","Historically, it was suggested that elderly patients do not fare well after surgery for colorectal cancer. Recent report, however, have recommended a standard surgical approach for this group of patients. Our data strongly suggest an important role in perioperative resuscitation, fluid balance and osmolality avoiding dehydration and intestinal ischemia. The analysis of the literature reveals that a large proportion of elderly patients survive for 5 years or more following CRC resection. The results of our study support the view that elective CRC resection in the elderly population is worthwhile and should be performed for the same indications as younger patients. Resection should still be the first choice of treatment for elderly CRC patients. Our study renews this statement showing, in elective procedure, no perioperative mortality in under 75 s and a value of 3.1% in over 75 s. Resectional surgery in elderly patients is justified because it has been shown that old age per se is not an independent prognostic factor for surgery, although it is a significant factor for short-term morbidity and survival as we have reported."
6,Characterisation of E12/E47 expression in colorectal cancer,"In the Western world colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, and the second most common cancer in women and the third in men. Identification of prognostic markers capable of predicting patient response to chemotherapy is essential to determine more personalised and efficient treatment strategies in colorectal cancer, and may help identify novel therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to characterise the expression of the E2A transcriptional regulator proteins, E12/E47 (also known as TCF-3 or E2A) in colorectal cancer patient tissue samples. Primarily E12/E47 antibody optimisation was required to allow us to subsequently examine E12/E47 protein expression in colorectal cancer tissue and investigate any correlation with patient outcome.",Candidate antibodies directed against the E12/E47 protein were first evaluated by western blotting and densitometry assays on four different types of human colon cancer cell lines. Surgically resected colorectal tumours were obtained from 198 patients presenting with Dukes B and C colorectal cancer. Tissue microarrays were constructed from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded samples. Tissue microarrays were then stained with varying dilutions of the candidate antibodies to establish a reliable and reproducible staining protocol.,"In order to optimise the E12/E47 staining on tissue samples, two different antibodies, a rabbit monoclonal TCF-3 antibody (Cell Signaling) and a rabbit polyclonal E2A antibody (Santa Cruz) were used. Serial dilutions of these antibodies were made to determine the optimal concentration of antibody to use. Using immunohistochemistry, the first antibody did not detect any specific signal while a nuclear/cytoplasmic localisation of E12/E47 was identified in some tissue samples using the E2A antibody. This staining was scored in line with the Allred Immunohistochemistry Scoring system.",Via antibody and protocol optimisation we were able to establish a protocol to specifically identify E12/E47 protein in human colorectal cancer tissue microarrays. This enables us to identify whether a correlation between E12/E47 expression in colorectal cancer patient tissue exists and whether it expression is linked to tumour aggressiveness. The identification of novel colorectal cancer markers may be relevant for diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients.
7,Discovery of molecular determinants of response to targeted therapies in colorectal cancer using patient-derived xenografts (‘xenopatients’),"Only a fraction of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receive clinical benefit from therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies. Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) correlate with poor response to anti-EGFR antibodies.","By implantation and serial propagation in NOD/SCID mice, we produced large xenograft cohorts from 85 patient-derived mCRC samples (""xenopatients"").","Xenopatients retained the histological and genomic features of the original counterparts, responded to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab similarly to clinical observations, and could be prospectively stratified as responders or nonresponders based on predictive biomarkers. Genotype-response correlations indicated HER2 amplification specifically in a subset of cetuximab-resistant, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type cases. In this subset, combined HER2/EGFR inhibition induced long-lasting tumor regression. We also assessed the effects of MEK and PI3K/mTor inhibitors (AZD6244 and BEZ235 respectively) in 40 specimens harboring KRAS/ NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutations. Cotreatment of xenografts with AZD6244+BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244. Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage. The extent of disease control declined upon prolonged treatment.",Our preclinical platform prospectively recapitulated biomarker-based case stratification and was instrumental in identifying HER2 as a predictor of resistance to cetuximab and of response to combination therapies against HER2 and EGFR. The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in KRAS-mutant mCRC patients.
8,Complications after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer: the evidence for nursing care,"Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgical treatment require planning and preparation of interventions for prevention of postoperative complications, especially considering the complexity and commitment of its clinical and psychosocial condition.",To identify and synthesize the factors that influence the occurrence of postoperative complications and establish the implications of these scientific evidence for nursing care.,"It is an integrative review of literature where descriptors were used, wound, colorectal cancer and complications with search in the databases Medline, CINAHL and Lilacs, resulting in a sample of 10 scientific articles.","Results indicated that the preoperative bowel preparation, staging and tumor location, surgical technique and care of the wound in the postoperative period as the factors influencing the occurrence of postoperative complications."
9,Distinct gene expression signatures in Lynch syndrome and familial colorectal cancer type X,Heredity is estimated to cause at least 20% of colorectal cancer. The hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) subset is divided into Lynch syndrome and familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) based on presence of mismatch repair gene defects. We addressed the gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer linked to Lynch syndrome and FCCTX with the aim to identify diagnostic discriminators and to map signaling pathways relevant to hereditary colorectal carcinogenesis.,"RNA extracted from 123 colorectal cancers, including 39 Lynch syndrome tumors, 37 FCCTX tumors and 47 sporadic tumors was analyzed using the whole-genome c-DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation (WG-DASL) assay containing 18k genes, where after key targets were validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).","Colorectal cancers linked to Lynch syndrome and FCCTX showed distinct gene expression profiles, which by significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) differed by 2188 genes. Functional pathways involved were related to G-protein coupled receptor signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle function and mitosis and genes herein proved deregulated using qRT-PCR.",Distinct genetic profiles and deregulation of different canonical pathways apply to Lynch syndrome and FCCTX and key targets herein may be relevant to pursue in relation to refined diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for hereditary colorectal cancer.
10,Targeted next-generation sequencing of colorectal cancer identified metastatic specific genetic alterations,"In colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cause of cancer and cancer death for both men and women in the USA, the steps necessary for carcinogenesis have been well defined. However, the genetic changes necessary for tumor evolution to metastasis are not as well elucidated. Therefore, we searched for the presence of mutations in key cancer genes in primary and metastatic colorectal cancer to determine whether primary or metastatic tissue is ideal for biomarker analysis and to identify putative biomarkers.","Fifty patient-matched primary tumor, metastatic tumor and normal samples from CRC patients were sequenced using a panel of 230 genes that are actionable, have been shown to be mutated in human tumors, and/or are part of commonly dysregulated pathways. This assay, coined IMPACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), provided sequence data to a median depth of coverage of 644X, allowing for identification of low-frequency genetic events. Mutations, insertion/deletions (indels) and copy number events were analyzed comparing both primary and metastatic samples with the corresponding patient normal.","The majority of genetic events were identical between primary and metastatic tumors; most frequently mutated were the genes commonly associated with CRC, such as APC, TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA. A number of mutations were found only in the primary samples, suggesting that these events were not important for tumor progression. Most interesting were the identification of genetic events specific to the metastatic sample: the majority of these alterations were members of two important proliferative pathways, further lending credence that they might play an important role in metastatic progression. Importantly, one of these pathways can be targeted by a number of FDA-approved therapies.","While the majority of primary and metastatic tumors present with the same genetic events in key cancer genes, additional events in critical pathways were specific to the corresponding metastatic tumors. Further analysis is in process to determine whether these differences are caused by sampling biases within the primary tumor that could be rectified in clinical analysis. The identification of these genetic variations between primary and metastatic tumors could have significant impact on biomarker analysis as well treatment decisions for CRC patients."
11,Targeting mutant BRAF in colorectal cancer,"Mutations in BRAF V600E oncogene (BRAFMT) occurs in 8-15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients1. This mutation constitutively activates MAPK signalling, resulting in a proliferative and survival advantage for the tumour cells and oncogenic BRAF status has been linked with poor prognosis2. Despite introduction of the BRAFMT specific inhibitor Vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma3, there is no effective treatment strategy for BRAFMT CRC patients. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Ganetespib (HSP90 inhibitor), the multi-kinase inhibitor (CRAF/VEGFR/PDGFR) Sorafenib and the BRAFMT inhibitor Vemurafenib in BRAFMT CRC cell line models.",BRAF MT RKO F6-8 (MT/WT) and isogenic wild-type T29 (null/WT) cell lines were used. MTT assays were used to determine IC50 values. Protein expression was determined by Western Blotting. Levels of apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry.,"The RKO BRAFMT cell line was equally sensitive to Sorafenib and Ganetespib compared to the isogenic BRAFWT clone (IC50 1.4µM vs. 0.9 µM and 0.86 nM vs. 0.79nM respectively). Vemurafenib treatment resulted in a strong decrease in MAPK signalling and showed greater specificity towards BRAFMT cells (IC50 of 2.4µM vs. 3.3 µM) than BRAFWT cells in cell viability assay. Western blotting showed that neither Sorafenib nor Ganetespib had an observable effect in targeting mutant BRAF. Sorafenib did have some effect at targeting downstream MAPK signalling however Ganetespib had no observable effect on targeting the MAPK pathway in BRAF mutant cell lines.. Vemurafenib targeted BRAF and downstream MEK activation in both mutant-type cell lines but not in the wild-type cell lines. We also found that treatment with Vemurafenib induced activation of the STAT3 survival pathway, highlighting a resistance pathway which may be activated in response to treatment in BRAFMT cell lines.","Despite the number of compounds which can target BRAFMT cell lines through inhibition of mutant BRAF directly or indirectly through inhibition of other pathways, our studies have shown that Vemurafenib is the most effective treatment strategy in the cell line model tested. Effects of Ganetespib or Sorafenib treatment did not display specificity towards BRAFMT cells alone nor an effect on mutant BRAF. Vemurafenib has shown selectivity towards BRAFMT cells in which a reduction in MAPK signaling is achieved along with induction of apoptosis. Evidence of the emergence of a potential resistance mechanism via STAT3 following Vemurafenib treatment was also found giving insight into the kinome reprogramming event which takes place following treatment."
12,Tumor-tailored treatment of colorectal cancer: from bench to bedside?,"A broad variety of systemic treatment options are available for non-resectable colorectal cancer in UICC stage IV disease. Depending on age, comorbidity, the possibility of a secondary resection, the personal experience with specific drug combinations, and national guidelines physicians choose a treatment option. At present, only Ki-ras status is determined as an individual biological marker for resistance to anti-EGF receptor treatment with cetuximab. The use of other molecular markers could so far not be transferred to routine clinical use as a guide for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a key enzyme in DNA synthesis and one major target of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. Several studies demonstrated that tumors with high TS expression did not respond to 5-FU treatment, whereas tumors with high TS may still respond to irinotecan (CPT-11), a topoisomerase II inhibitor.",The aim of our study was to determine the value of pre-therapeutic tumoral TS level for selecting chemotherapy.,We designed a phase II multicenter trial comparing first-line monotreatment with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) and the combination of 5-FU/FA and irinotecan. A biopsy from a reference lesion of patients with stage IV non-resectable colorectal cancer planned to undergo systemic palliative chemotherapy was taken. Relative TS mRNA expression from microdissected tumor tissue was determined followed by stratification in TS low and TS high and subsequent randomisation to mono- or combination treatment. Primary endpoint was response to treatment.,"A total of 168 patients underwent TS determination. ITT analysis of response revealed that toxicity was higher in patients receiving combination treatment. Overall survival not influenced by TS or treatment. Response to the combination treatment was similar in the TS low and high group. In contrast, response to 5-FU monotherapy was higher in the TS low group in comparison to the TS high group."
13,Prevention for colorectal cancer: from basic research to clinical study,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is third common cancer in world. Both incidence and mortality of CRC in China are increasing. Pooled individual data indicated that the recurrent rate of colorectal adenoma (CRA) underwent the polypectomy is high.,Papers in major gastroenterology journals published were retrieved from MEDLINE. The data from my group and other medical centers were also analyzed.,"Folic acid (FA) and butyrate suppress the cell proliferation in CRC cell lines and in mouse. The tumor incidence in DMH group and DMH + butyrate group were 90% and 30%, respectively. And the subgroup of providing FA without precancerous lesions was more effective than that with precancerous lesions.The data from RCT, Cohort and case-control study showed that many studies report that aspirin decrease the incidence and mortality of CRC in average-risk persons, aspirin and Celecoxib prevent the initial and recurrence of advanced CRA. However, NSAID are ulcerogenic to the stomach and duodenum and lead to a threefold to 10fold increase in ulcer complications, hospitalisation, and death from ulcer disease. Followed along with the increasing the dose of cox2 inhibitors, although prevention effect increased, while the serious cardiovascular events was increased.Many studies indicated that a dose-response inverse association between dietary folate intake and risk of colon cancer. However, the result from clinical trial published in JAMA 2007 showed that FA at 1mg/d does not reduce CRA recurrent risk, and was associated with higher risks of having 3 or more adenomas and of non CRC. In fact, the FA prevention effect is associated with FA concentration at baseline. For patients who’s FA concentration lower than 7.5ng/mL, FA decrease the recurrence rate of CRA, but not patient who’s FA high than 7.5 ng/ml. A report published in Am J Clin Nutr indicated that folate intake and risk of CRC and CRA: modification by time.The association between fiber and colorectal neoplasia has been intensively investigated. However, in some studies this topic remains controversial. Many studies showed that calcium and vitamin D reduce risk of CRC. We also found that calcium prevent the recurrence of sporadic CRA.",The primary prevention for CRC contains the primary and secondary prevention for CRA. Primary prevention also is to reduce the incidence of CRA.
14,Translational medicine research on early detection and early diagnosis of colorectal cancer in China,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer in China. The incidence of CRC is increasing rapidly. The early detection and early diagnosis is the effective way to decreasing the mortality and increasing the survival rate.,"From 2007, a CRC screening program was begun in three cities (Hangzhou, Haerbing, and Shanghai city, aimed at finding more early CRC cases and premalignant lesions such as adenoma. The two steps screening model was applied. As the primary screening, the Simultaneous iFOBT (immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Testing) and high risk factors questionnaire investigation (HRFQ) will be employed for selection the high risk population from target population. Then the high risk population will be further selected by colonoscopy.","the compliance of the two steps screening model was only 34.88% (1650/ 4730) in city target. The overall positive rate in the first screening stage was 13.5% (4,730 of 35,037). In the second stage, the positive rate of total colorectal neoplasm was 27.27% (450/1650) in the total study population. The detected ratesof cancer, adenoma, non-adenomatous polyps, and advanced neoplasm were 13%.",The combining iFOBT and HRFQ as primary screening methods is an efficient CRC screening strategy in economically and medically underserved population. But the novel early CRC markers were still needed to improve the compliance of the screening program.
15,A multi-centre randomised Phase III trial of radioembolisation (RE) combined with oxmdg compared with oxmdg alone as first-line therapy for unresectable liver-only or liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC),Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide; the leading cause of death from this disease is progression of liver metastases. Radio-embolisation (RE) with yttrium-90 microspheres is a local radiotherapy treatment targeting liver metastases. The FOXFIRE trial has randomised over 200 participants in the UK and will be open to recruitment until May 2014.,"Eligible patients have non-resectable liver metastases from histologically confirmed CRC with no or limited extra-hepatic disease and no prior treatment for metastatic disease. Each patient is randomised 1:1 to standard chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin, Folinic Acid, 5-Flurouracil) or chemotherapy plus RE, using minimisation with stratification factors: centre, liver involvement, presence of extra-hepatic disease and intention to treat with a biological agent.","


Slow site activation: this trial involves complex radiological intervention, involving multi-disciplinary team working. These teams had to be formed for the trial. This caused complex negotiations facilitated by the trials office to encourage communication between different departments to ensure adequate quality of care.


Change to current the treatment paradigm affecting recruitment: a protocol amendment was necessary to allow the use of biological agents (cetuximab or bevacizumab) with intent-to-treat with a biological agent added as a stratum to the randomisation.


","The key to improving recruitment has been regular communication with the site staff, newsletters, adapting to changing treatment paradigms, opening more sites than originally planned and providing publicity via the local research networks."
