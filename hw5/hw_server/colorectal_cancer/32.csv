0,Elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio associated with concurrent administration of regorafenib and warfarin in a patient with advanced colorectal cancer,"Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor, which has shown antitumor activity in patients with advanced colorectal cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumors who have previously received standard treatment and discontinued it owing to disease progression or side effects [1, 2]. Regorafenib is mainly metabolized to M-2 and M-5 by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, both of which have pharmacological activity similar to that of regorafenib [3]. In addition, results from in vitro analysis showed that regorafenib and its metabolites might inhibit the activity of several CYPs such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms [3].The plasma concentration of warfarin, the substrate for CYP2C9, could be increased with the concurrent use of regorafenib, which leads to enhance warfarin’s anticoagulant effects. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of warfarin increases with concurrent administration of regorafenib [3]. However, there are no reports indicating that regorafenib interacts with warfarin and leads to increased anticoagulant effects. Here, we report the case of a patient with advanced colon cancer, who experienced elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) with concurrent use of regorafenib and warfarin.","A 76-year-old man with stage IV colon cancer metastasis underwent resection of part of the colon and cholecystectomy. He had a history of hypothyroidism and acute myocardial infarction. He did not drink alcohol but had a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years. He had taken medicines, including levothyroxine (75 μg daily), spironolactone (25 mg daily), nicorandil (10 mg daily), pravastatin (5 mg daily), allopurinol (200 mg daily), and warfarin (2 mg daily). After surgery, treatment was started with modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX6, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin, 400 mg/m2 5-FU bolus on day 1 and 2400 mg/m2 5-FU over 46 h every 2 weeks) in July 2012 to liver metastasis. His PT/INR value was controlled around 2.0 before receiving mFOLFOX6 and did not increase when this treatment was given. He was received mFOLFOX6 for 6 months, but his carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level increased, and computed tomography (CT) showed progression of liver metastasis. Then, treatment with irinotecan (CPT-11) plus S-1 was initiated (CPT-11 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks). His PT/INR value slightly increased to 2.98 from 2.31 2 weeks after CPT-11 plus S-1 was administered. Then the dose of warfarin was reduced to 1 mg and PT/INR value decreased to around 2.0. However, after 3 cycles of treatment with CPT-11 plus S-1, he developed interstitial pneumonia and discontinued this therapy, leading to decreased PT/INR value around 1.3. Furthermore, the interstitial pneumonia improved but a CT scan indicated that his hepatic metastasis had progressed. Then, he began a course of treatment with regorafenib at a dosage of 120 mg daily on days 1 to 21 every 4 weeks in October 2013. The warfarin dose was increased up to 1.5 mg one month before initiation of treatment with regorafenib and up to 2 mg again when regorafenib was given concurrently (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) values and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels during regorafenib treatment. Only an important points are mentioned PT/INR values (day on course) after co-administration of regorafenibFull size image
Although the patient’s PT/INR value was 1.26 before initiation of treatment with regorafenib, this value significantly increased to 2.1 on day 8, 2.98 on day 15, and 6.4 on day 22 (Fig. 1). Regorafenib and warfarin treatments were discontinued, and his PT/INR value decreased to 1.31 within 1 week after the discontinuation. Then, warfarin was reduced by 0.5 mg daily and was restarted. As he had developed grade 2 hand-foot syndrome during the first cycle of treatment, regorafenib was also reduced by 80 mg daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks at a physician's discretion and was restarted.The warfarin dose was increased up to 1 mg daily after 2 weeks and up to 1.5 mg daily after 2 months, respectively. Although his PT/INR value increased gradually with an increasing dose of warfarin, further elevation was not seen with the concomitant use of regorafenib. Additionally, laboratory findings showed that liver functions including alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase serum levels were normal, although the liver metastasis showed slight progression on a CT scan (data not shown).In March 2014, regorafenib and warfarin treatment were discontinued again because the patient developed a pneumothorax. One month later, the pneumothorax healed and the patient was restarted on a course of warfarin (1.5 mg daily) prior to regorafenib. Two weeks later, regorafenib treatment was also restarted at the same treatment schedule and dose, at which time his PT/INR value was 2.04. His PT/INR value increased to 3.37 again on day 8 after restarting treatment with regorafenib (Fig. 1). He was then discharged with the treatment of 1 mg warfarin daily. The PT/INR value reduced to 2.37 one week after the reduction of warfarin treatment. Then, the PT/INR value did not increase during the concomitant use of regorafenib. However, his CEA level increased, and his hepatic metastasis showed progression on a CT scan. Then, treatment with regorafenib was discontinued and the patient was treated with trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (Lonsurf®). PT/INR value did not increase when the salvage treatment with Lonsurf® was given (data not shown).This case report was approved by the ethics review committee of the Houju Memorial Hospital (Ishikawa, Japan) (No. 16–5).","This is the first report of a patient with advanced colon cancer who had a significant increase in the PT/INR when administered warfarin concomitantly with regorafenib. Although the warfarin dose was increased up to 2 mg when regorafenib was administered simultaneously, the patient did not demonstrate a marked increase in PT/INR with a daily 2 mg dose of warfarin before receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, we suggest that this event was not caused only by an increase in the dose of warfarin.There is a possibility that impaired hepatic function due to tumor progression results in the elevation of PT/INR, but no deterioration of liver function was observed, while hepatic metastasis had slightly progressed during the regorafenib treatment. In addition, it is suggested that regorafenib itself may increase the PT/INR value directly via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, which is related to the induction of angiogenesis. Indeed, a previous report showed that INR value increased in 120 out of 500 patients (24 %) who were treated with regorafenib [3]. However, in this case, the PT/INR value did not increase when a low dose of warfarin (0.5–1 mg daily) was administered, whereas its value increased at the warfarin dose was increased up to 1.5–2 mg, while the dose of regorafenib was same (Fig. 1). Therefore, we speculate that PT/INR increase in this case was not caused by direct action of regorafenib but by drug interaction between regorafenib and warfarin.We assessed this event using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, which indicated a probable relationship (score of 6) between regorafenib use and the elevated PT/INR value [4]. The Naranjo scale was designed to evaluate single drug adverse events, not drug interactions. We also assessed the causation of this adverse reaction using the drug interaction probability scale score for potential drug interactions in the patient, which indicated a probable likelihood of an interaction (score of 7) [5].Warfarin is highly bound (99 %) to human plasma proteins [6]. In vitro protein binding of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 to human plasma proteins is also high at 99.5, 99.8, and 99.95 %, respectively [3]. There were no change in serum albumin level during concomitant use of regorafenib and warfarin in our case (data not shown). Although we could not measure the plasma free levels of warfarin or regorafenib and its metabolite, it is possible that the concentration of plasma-free warfarin will be elevated and lead to increased anticoagulant effects via competition for protein binding sites when these two drugs are used concurrently. However, it is unknown that which metabolite is most contribute to the displacement warfarin from plasma proteins.Warfarin is metabolized via several CYPs, including CYP3A4, with involvement of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18 and CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 [7–10]. S-warfarin, which exhibits potent anticoagulant activity, is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 [7]. Regorafenib and its metabolite M-2 inhibit CYP2C9 [3]. IC50 values for CYP2C9 inhibition by regorafenib and M-2 are 2.7 and 6.1 μM, respectively [11]. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analysis from a phase I study also revealed that after oral administration of 160 mg or 120 mg regorafenib for 3 weeks, the plasma Cmax value in its steady state of regorafenib is slightly higher than that of M-2 [12, 13]. In this case, the patient was not administered regorafenib concomitantly with a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4, which is the main enzyme involved in metabolism of regorafenib. Therefore, although we could not measure plasma Cmax values of regorafenib and M-2 at the steady state, we speculate that the steady state Cmax value of regorafenib in this case could also be larger than that of M-2. Therefore, we speculate that regorafenib may have more potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C9 than M-2, considering IC50 and steady state Cmax values of them.In this case, a significant elevation of PT/INR occurred 3 weeks after regorafenib co-administration. Goto et al. reported that hematuria and a marked increase in PT/INR occurred after administering warfarin for about 1 month [14]. In this report, PT/INR increased due to CYP2C9 variants because the patient had the CYP2C9*3/*3 allele. Indeed, CYP2C9 genotypes are closely associated with warfarin dose adjustment [15]. Of the more than 30 identified CYP2C9 variants, the CYP2C9*3 allele is associated with reduced enzyme activity and requires lower maintenance doses of warfarin [16]. Obayashi et al. reported that the mean daily dose of warfarin was lower in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 (1.86 ± 0.80 mg daily) than in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 (3.36 ± 1.43 mg daily) in a Japanese population [17]. A similar result was reported by Ohno et al. for differences in the mean maintenance dose of warfarin in Japanese patients with CYP2C9 variants [18]. Although we did not analyze the CYP2C9 variant in our case, the PT/INR value was controlled with 2 mg warfarin daily before receiving chemotherapy. Thus, we speculate that the patient might have the CYP2C9*3 allele, which might contribute to an increase in the PT/INR after the concomitant administration of regorafenib.Moreover, it has been reported that other oral multikinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, sorafenib, and vemurafenib, when used concurrently with warfarin, may also have the ability to increase circulating levels of warfarin and potentiating its anticoagulant effects [19–21]. Therefore, when treatment with such oral multikinase inhibitors is administered to patients who receive warfarin daily, switching from warfarin to other novel oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban and apixaban based on drug interaction should be considered.","The clinical course of this patient suggested that the PT/INR increases during the concurrent use of warfarin and regorafenib. Therefore, PT/INR should be periodically monitored during the concurrent use of warfarin and regorafenib."
1,Peritoneal spillage is not an issue in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common solid malignancies with about 70,000 new cases per year in Germany [1]. Unfortunately, an advanced disease with nodal (stage III) and distant (stage IV) metastases classified using the Union International Contre Le Cancer (UICC) classification is present in about 20% of cases at the time of diagnosis, rendering curative resection difficult [2]. Generally, the prognosis of CRC has been shown to be stage-dependent. Metastasis to the peritoneum among all sites of distant metastasis has been shown to be associated with an extremely poor prognosis with a median survival of just about 7 months [3]. Recurrently, modern oncologic strategies for the management of this subgroup encompassing cytoreductive surgery and intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have evolved [4]. Data on this treatment option as well as experience from specialized oncologic centers are encouraging [5,6,7].Oncologic resection with clear margins and systematic nodal dissection with complete mesocolic excision (CME) for colon cancer as described by Höhenberger et al. [8], and partial mesorectal excision (PME) for tumors of the rectosigmoidal junction and proximal rectum and total mesorectal excision (TME) as described by Heald et al. [9] for mid and low rectal cancer have been unequivocally proven to be determinants for recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Traditionally, oncologic colorectal resection was openly performed. However, solid evidences from well-designed international double-blind multicenter studies like the CLASICC, COLOR, and COREAN trials have established the non-inferiority of laparoscopic oncologic colorectal resection in comparison to open surgery [10,11,12]. More so, the benefits of minimally invasive access in colorectal surgery in the era of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) have contributed to increased acceptance of the minimally invasive approach [13]. Currently, the minimally invasive approach has evolved to be the standard for the management of patients with CRC in specialized centers.Despite the abovementioned advantages, the initial acceptance of minimally invasive oncologic colorectal resection was low. Reported cases of port site metastasis in the abdominal wall questioned the safety of the technique [14]. Besides, reports of rare cases of peritoneal spillage and port site seeding following laparoscopic resection of CRC have been worrisome [15, 16]. Theoretically, peritoneal spillage and port site seeding may occur as a result of pressure on the tumor during dissection and/or retrieval of the colectomy specimen. This disastrous complication may be secondary to surgery and therefore may be coined as a perioperative complication. Both peritoneal spillage and port site seeding dampened many proponents of minimally invasive management of CRC. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of peritoneal tumor spillage during laparoscopic oncologic resection for CRC.","Minimally invasive oncologic resection is the standard procedure for patients with CRC in our department. According to our departmental standards, all patients diagnosed with CRC are presented at the multidisciplinary oncologic board prior to treatment. Since this constituted our standard clinical practice, ethics approval was waived.All consecutive cases of CRC undergoing surgical resection via minimally invasive access within the period of observation from March to October 2018 were included in this study. Cases with open surgery and all cases converted from laparoscopic to open surgery were excluded from analysis. Cases with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis during surgery and cases undergoing palliative procedures were also excluded. All cases were prospectively recorded in a database.Oncologic resection consisted of CME for colon cancer, PME for cancers of the rectosigmoidal junction and proximal rectum, and TME for mid and low rectal cancer. Intracorporeal resection of the involved segment was performed after radical dissection using laparoscopic lineal stapling devices. The specimen was removed from the abdominal cavity using an endoscopic retrieval bag (endobag). The colectomy or rectum specimen was taken out of the endobag for inspection. Hereafter, 20 ml normal saline was instilled into the endobag, which was then reclosed and gently shaken for 30 s. The resulting content was collected in a cytology vessel and sent for histopathology.Post-surgical oncologic management with regard to adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up was in accordance with international standards.","Ninety-eight cases with CRC were managed in our department during the period of investigation. Palliation and local ablative procedures were performed in seven cases.Attempted laparoscopic resection was performed in 81 cases. Conversion to open surgery was performed in eight patients, putting the rate of conversion at 9.8%. Primary open surgery was performed in 10 cases. The distribution of the study population is presented in Fig. 1.

Reasons for exclusion: palliation surgery 4×, transanal resection 2×, definitive radiation 1×, and primary open surgery 10×Full size imageThe study group consisted of 73 (34 female and 39 male) patients undergoing laparoscopic oncologic resection for CRC. The median age at the time of surgery was 71 years (range 38–90 years). A summary of the postoperative histopathologic findings of the study population is presented in Table 1. Cytology was negative in all cases. No case of peritoneal recurrence has been recorded in the study population within a follow-up period of 14–20 months.

M1: 10× hepatic metastasis, 1× metastasis to the ovary, 1× metastasis in the large omentum, and 1× metastasis in a distant lymph nodeFull size table","Oncologic colorectal resection via the minimally invasive route is increasingly being employed for the management of patients with CRC. Reports of peritoneal spillage and port site metastasis secondary to laparoscopic management of CRC have been a cause of concern. We investigated the risk of peritoneal seeding in patients undergoing laparoscopic oncologic resections for CRC. No case of spillage was found in this series irrespective of the tumor stage.The current literature on peritoneal spillage and port site seeding following laparoscopic resection of CRC is limited to case reports [17,18,19]. Nonetheless, these devastating cases dampened the initial enthusiasm of laparoscopic oncologic colorectal surgery and questioned the safety of minimally invasive surgery for oncologic entities including CRC [20]. Besides published case reports, data on peritoneal spillage and port site seeding is limited.The largest study looking into wound, port site, and peritoneal recurrence is a meta-analysis from 2013 by Zanghi et al. comparing the outcomes of 2431 laparoscopic and 2176 open cases. No differences were found between the laparoscopic (27/2431, 0.01%) and the open (17/2176, 0.01%) groups with regard to wound, port site, and peritoneal recurrence [15]. The main finding from this meta-analysis argues for the safety of laparoscopic resection of CRC.No study so far has purposely investigated the risk of peritoneal spillage in patients undergoing laparoscopic oncologic colorectal resection. This study therefore, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first prospectively designed study to investigate the risk of peritoneal spillage in patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for CRC.Cytology specimens of 73 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic oncologic resection for CRC were investigated in this study. All cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells. The risk of peritoneal spillage has been thought to be associated with the tumor size. The majority of patients with peritoneal recurrence following laparoscopic resection of CRC reported so far underwent surgery for advanced CRC, mostly stage C according to Dukes’ classification [21,22,23]. In most cases, peritoneal recurrence was diagnosed within 12 months. This tendency could not be confirmed in our study. Postoperative histopathology confirmed stage III and IV tumors in 41% of our study population. Even in these cases, cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells. So far, no case of peritoneal recurrence has been seen within the follow-up period of more than 14 months. This intriguing finding must be interpreted as an argument for the safety of minimally invasive surgery even in selected patients with large tumors.Recently published data suggests some advantages of intracorporeal over extracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis following laparoscopic right colectomy with respect to anastomotic leakage, early return of bowel movement, and length of incision [24,25,26]. Thus, the trend is towards total intracorporeal resection and anastomosis. The main finding from our study is strongly in accordance with the development in minimally invasive oncologic colorectal surgery.The lack of malignant cells in all cytology specimens documented in our study has prompted us to change our departmental standards with regard to colectomy specimen retrieval. Endoscopic retrieval bags (endobags) are no longer routinely used in our department for specimen retrieval. This change of concept has reduced our departmental expenditure for endobags.The time interval between cytology sample collection and histopathologic analysis is not documented in this series. This may be a possible limitation due to the fact that cells may disintegrate while being stored in saline. False negative cytology therefore may have occurred due to cell disintegration in some cases. The duration of a rather short follow-up (14 months) constitutes another limitation in this study. We therefore would be reporting on the long-term survival data of this collective in the future.Taken together, cytology of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer in this study was negative in all cases. This finding suggests that laparoscopic resection of CRC may not increase the risk of peritoneal spillage as long as oncologic standards are respected."
