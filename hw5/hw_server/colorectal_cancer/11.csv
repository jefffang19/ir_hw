0,Re-interpreting the data on the cost and effectiveness of population screening for colorectal cancer in Australia,"In 1996, Salkeld et al. [1] found that screening the average-risk Australian population for colorectal cancer using a faecal occult blood test (FOBT), compared to existing practice, would cost $24,660 per life-year gained (LYG). Due to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of FOBT screening, they report a range of values, between $12,695 and $67,848 per LYG. Randomised controlled trials of population screening with FOBT conducted in the UK [2] and Denmark [3], but published after Salkeld et al.'s study, have reduced this uncertainty. The cost-effectiveness analyses based on the UK trial data [4] suggest a cost per life-year gained between £1,371–£5,685 (approximately $AU3,370–13,974) and the analysis of the Danish trial data [5] suggest a cost per life-year gained between 17,000–42,000DKK (approximately $AU3,916–9,672).Three years before publication of Salkeld's study Bolin [6] discussed the advantages of using colonoscopy for population screening, and in 1996, he suggested colonoscopy was cost-effective [7]. In 1997, he asked whether the time had come to use colonoscopy for population screening in Australia [8]. Kermond [9] responded suggesting double contrast barium enema (DCBE) should not be overlooked arguing colonoscopy is 10 times more expensive, false negatives still occur and complication rates are higher. Bolin argued, in the same issue of the MJA, that the sensitivity of colonoscopy exceeds DCBE, the complication rate is only 0.1% and cost differentials are actually less than those suggested by Kermond [9].Bolin also claimed that FOBT at one and three years and colonoscopy at 10 years, assuming a 10-year period during which time the cancer is detectable and curable (known as the dwell time), are cost-effective modes of CRC screening, probably referring to data subsequently published in 1999 [10]. For this research, the authors substituted Australian values for cost parameters into a US model of the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening [11] and generalised the results to the Australian population. They reported change in cost and change in life-years gained, as compared to existing practice, for competing screening strategies that encompass FOBT, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and DCBE [10]. By assuming that society is willing to pay up to $US40,000 (approximately $AU65,449 in 2002 prices) per LYG, Bolin proposed that annual FOBT, triennial FOBT, triennial DCBE, five-yearly DCBE, five-yearly colonoscopy and ten-yearly colonoscopy are all cost-effective and concluded that physicians have the option of offering individuals a range of screening alternatives, including colonoscopy [10]. Since publishing the research Bolin has argued, on four separate occasions that population screening with colonoscopy is cost-effective [12–15]. The last of these, in 2002 [14], provoked Macrae and Hebbard [16] to criticise Bolin's interpretation of epidemiological data.In 2004, O'Leary et al. [17] also addressed the economic questions around population screening in Australia. They estimated the cost-effectiveness, compared to existing practice, of FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, and found flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were cost-effective but FOBT was not.There are important differences in the way that Salkeld et al. [1], Bolin et al. [10] and O'Leary et al. [17] report the Australian cost and effectiveness data. Salkeld et al. reports an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, O'Leary et al. reports both average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, however they draw their conclusions from an average analysis. Bolin only calculates average cost-effectiveness ratios. The correct ratio for decision-making is an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: McMahon [18] argues the use of average ratios is not meaningful; Drummond [19] and Gold [20] both discuss why incremental rather than average cost-effectiveness ratios are relevant for decision making; and, both Torgerson [21] and Neuhauser & Lewicki [22] provide examples of how average analyses muddy the waters. In their much-cited 1975 paper, Neuhauser & Lewicki [22] reviewed data on screening for CRC. They illustrated that repeatedly testing a stool sample up to six times, when a previous test result was negative, would capture all cases of CRC, at an average cost per case of $2451. They also did an incremental analysis, with the same data, and showed the incremental cost per case detected, from the fifth to sixth round of testing was $47 million. This illustrates that average analyses can be grossly misleading.We have four objectives in this paper: first, to demonstrate why incremental, not average, cost-effectiveness ratios should be used for decision-making; second, to update the cost data reported by Salkeld et al. [1], Bolin et al. [10] and O'Leary et al. [17] to 2002 Australian dollar prices; third, to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the Bolin data; and fourth, to discuss the results of our re-analysis, comparing the outcomes from the three previous studies. This will provide readers with an up-to-date and appropriate assessment of the existing cost-effectiveness data for population-based CRC screening programmes in Australia.","Average cost-effectiveness ratios for health care interventions are the amounts by which costs change from a baseline comparator (ΔC) divided by the amount by which health benefits change from a baseline comparator (ΔE). The baseline comparator is often existing practice. We illustrate this method with hypothetical data in Table 1 by presenting the change in costs and health effects that arise from four competing health care alternatives. If we remain with Existing Practice, there is no change in cost or health effect. However, if we are committed to generating health effects and we wish to be efficient, then we should choose the cheapest option that improves health outcomes. The data in Table 1 show that Intervention 4 generates the best ratio of (ΔC) and (ΔE) when compared to Existing Practice. Cost changes by $145,000 and health effects change by 150 and the cost per LYG is $967.Table 1 An illustration of average cost-effectiveness ratios for four competing hypothetical health care interventionsFull size tableWe reject Interventions 1 and 2. The reasons lie in Figure 1 (which is a graph of the data in Table 1). Intervention 1 generates less health benefit and higher costs than Intervention 4, a situation described as 'simple dominance'. For this comparison, Intervention 4 is preferred on both costs and outcomes. Intervention 2 also generates less health effect but differs from Intervention 1 in that it's cheaper than Intervention 4; however, the cost per LYG from Intervention 2 is greater than the cost per LYG from Intervention 4. This situation is known as 'extended dominance' and is only relevant if the cost of Intervention 4 ($145,000) exceeds the total amount of money available to the decision-maker. Rather than choosing Intervention 2 over Intervention 4, it would be better (more productively efficient) to choose some blend of existing practice and Intervention 4. This implies that some proportion of the population would receive Intervention 4 and the remainder would receive existing practice. This raises questions of equity of access and so poses another set of problems for decision-makers. If the available budget exceeds $145,000, there is a further question to consider. Do we invest in the more costly but more effective Intervention 3? Some care is required when making this decision. The average cost-effectiveness ratio for Intervention 3 ($1,200 per LYG), represented by the dashed line on Figure 1, is misleading. It's calculated by comparing Intervention 3 to existing practice; yet, the relevant decision is whether we should invest in Intervention 3 given that we have established Intervention 4 as the most cost-effective option. We must consider the incremental changes in cost and health effects compared to the next best alternative, Intervention 4. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Interventions 4 and 3 are marked with solid lines on Figure 1. When a more effective alternative also costs more, then the decision-maker must compare the increased cost with the increased effects [19]. The only way to achieve this is to conduct an incremental analysis, which we illustrate in Table 2. Investing in Intervention 3, as compared to 4, changes total costs by $155,000 and LYG by 100, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,550 per LYG not the $1,200 per LYG as previously estimated using average cost-effectiveness ratios and illustrated in Table 1.Table 2 An illustration of average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the two remaining hypothetical health care interventionsFull size tableFigure 1Change in cost and change in effect from four hypothetical health care interventions.Full size imageImagine you have decided to take a holiday in a beach resort. You face a decision between a standard apartment for $1,000 and a Penthouse apartment for $1,300. Because you have decided to take the holiday (and so one of the apartments), it is the difference in cost ($300) that you compare to the difference in benefit (penthouse vs. standard apartment). If you don't perceive the additional benefit to be worth the extra $300, then you reject the penthouse. This simple example illustrates the importance of thinking about decisions in terms of incremental changes. An average analysis with both options compared to 'no holiday' may lead to a bad decision.","We converted Bolin's $US dollar estimates to Australian dollars with the exchange rate reported in the original article [10] and adjusted the estimates reported by Bolin, Salkeld and O'Leary to 2002 prices using a health price index [23]. As Salkeld and O'Leary reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, we only need to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the Bolin data. We achieved this by inputting the reported estimates of (ΔC) and (ΔE) into decision analysis software [24]. Assuming a 5-year dwell time (the period during which cancer can be detected and cured), we include 13 screening strategies and the existing practice comparator. For a 10-year dwell time, estimates of (ΔC) and (ΔE)were reported for different, additional, frequencies of FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy and DCBE screening, resulting in 27 strategies and the existing practice comparator. We ranked all strategies by increasing cost, estimated incremental cost and effectiveness, and excluded all strategies for which other options prevailed on the basis of 'simple' or 'extended' dominance. Finally, we reported the strategies not excluded due to either 'simple' or 'extended' dominance and present the relevant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.In Table 3, we describe all strategies evaluated by the authors of the three studies.Table 3 Descriptions of the screening strategies included in the re-analysisFull size tableIn Figure 2, we illustrate the costs and effects of all strategies reported by Bolin, assuming a 5-year dwell time. The strategies to the left and above the cost-effective frontier, defined by the solid line, are excluded by either 'simple' or 'extended' dominance. The three remaining (un-dominated) strategies, that define the cost-effective frontier, are EXISTING PRACTICE, DCBE3 and FOBT1+DBCE3. In Table 4, we report all corresponding costs, health benefits and cost-effectiveness ratios, and indicate the options that are 'simply' dominated. In Table 5, we report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the options that survive the tests of 'simple' or 'extended' dominance; these options define the cost-effective frontier.Figure 2Updated costs and effects for Bolin et al's 13 tested strategies, assuming a five-year dwell time.Full size imageTable 4 Estimates of costs in 2002 prices, health benefits and cost-effectiveness from Bolin et al.

In this case EXISTING PRACTICE, FOBT2, DCBE5, DCBE3, FOBT1+DCBE5 and FOBT1+DCBE3 define the cost-effective frontier. In Table 6, we report all corresponding costs, health benefits and cost-effectiveness ratios, and indicate the options that are 'simply' dominated. In Table 7, we report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the options that survive the tests of 'simple' or 'extended' dominance; again, these options define the cost-effective frontier.Table 6 Estimates of costs in 2002 prices, health benefits and cost-effectiveness from Bolin et al.

[10], assuming a 10-year dwell timeFull size tableFigure 3Updated costs and effects for Bolin et al's 27 tested strategies, assuming a ten-year dwell time.Full size imageThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio derived from the Salkeld data, in 2002 prices, for FOBT, is $30,556 per LYG, and the 2002 incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the O'Leary data are $17,356 per LYG for FSIG and $26,587 per LYG for COL.These results define the screening options that are preferred (ie, not dominated), by the measure of cost-effectiveness, for population-based CRC screening in Australia. However, the decision over which to choose depends on additional factors that we discuss next.","We defined average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and emphasise the latter are relevant for decision-making. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in 2002 prices, for a number of population screening strategies, for which Bolin had previously reported average cost-effectiveness ratios. For Bolin's estimates of (ΔC) and (ΔE), for a 5-year dwell time, we found only DCBE3 ($49,792 per LYG) and FOBT1+DCBE3 ($139,952 per LYG) were preferred (not dominated). For a 10-year dwell time, FOBT2 ($39,459 per LYG), DCBE5 ($43,687 per LYG), DCBE3 ($80,616 per LYG), FOBT1+DCBE5 ($185,054 per LYG) and FOBT1+DCBE3 ($235,859 per LYG) were preferred (not dominated).Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are useful for decision-making when a ceiling value for a LYG is specified. Bolin argued in 1996 [7] that $US40,000 per LYG was the relevant cut-off (approximately $AU65,449 in 2002 prices). We prefer a decision rule described by Garber & Phelps [25] that states a LYG is worth approximately twice the median annual per capita income. They derived this value from a model of optimal lifetime spending for medical care and explored its relationship to the cost-effectiveness criterion. They evaluated the model in terms of maximizing utility for individuals, with utility a function of income and health. Their rule implies, for Australia, a rational cut-off for one LYG is approximately $AU39,000 [26].If we apply this rule to our interpretation of Bolin's data, we wouldn't recommend any additional population screening activities for the 5-year dwell time, and for a 10-year dwell time, we would only recommend FOBT2. Based on the O'Leary and Salkeld data we recommend COL and FOBT1, respectively. The results in Tables 4 and 6 illustrate the colonoscopy strategies, championed by Bolin, would cause between 33 and 1,322 years of life to be lost and between $M17 and $M87 to be wasted. We showed that all colonoscopy options were dominated by more cost-effective alternatives.Despite our re-analysis, the decision over which model of CRC screening is optimal for the Australian, average-risk population remains ambiguous. While the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from two studies support annual FOBT [1] or biennial FOBT [10], the most recent study supports colonoscopy [17]. At least we now have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in 2002 prices. While two of the studies agree that FOBT screening is preferred, we have not investigated why the O'Leary [17] analysis leads to a different conclusion. The answer may be sought in a careful assessment of model structures, the particular perspectives adopted for each analysis and the values used for the parameters, which is beyond the scope of this commentary. In addition, we haven't attempted to model the effect of uncertainty on the conclusions. This would require access to the models, data and software used in each of the previous three studies. Policy-makers should review the three papers and make a judgement over which they believe produces the best estimates of change in cost and health benefit, identify their willingness to pay for the proposed health benefits and make their decision in the context of other logistic, social and political issues."
1,Oral manifestations of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome: a family case series,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common tumor in developed countries [1, 2]. In Brazil, it is among the five more common malignant neoplasias and it is the third in mortality in both sexes [3]. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome (Lynch syndrome, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database number 120435) is the most common form of hereditary CRC; it has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance [1]. HNPCC has a high penetrance caused by a germline mutation in mismatch repair genes, most frequently MLH1 or MSH2. In order to establish the diagnosis of HNPCC, families are analyzed and classified according to Amsterdam Criteria I and II [4, 5]. The disease is characterized by the development of CRC at an early age (approximately 45-years old), which is located in the proximal colon in two-thirds of cases, and occurrence of extracolonic tumors (ovaries, endometrium, stomach and other) in affected families [5–7]. In a Brazilian HNPCC familial study, breast cancer followed by endometrial and uterine cervix cancer were the most frequent extracolon cancers found in women, and prostate and stomach tumors in men [8]. Early identification of families and individuals at high risk is essential to reduce CRC incidence. Furthermore, disease morbidity and mortality can be reduced if individuals are diagnosed and tumors are removed in time [7].Oral ectopic sebaceous glands, known as Fordyce granules (FGs), and alteration in vascular patterns in the oral mucosa are reported changes regarding oral manifestations of HNPCC [9–11]. An increase in number and size of sebaceous glands following activation of the hedgehog pathway has been reported [12]. This signaling pathway plays multiple roles in animal development and has been linked to the development and progression of several forms of cancer [13, 14]. FGs are common in adult patients, and are benign lesions that can appear in healthy individuals [15]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the presence of FGs in 3.8% to 27.9% [16–19] of the normal population with a higher prevalence in male patients [16, 17]. However, it has been suggested that FGs may be associated with systemic disease and clinical observation could be helpful to increase the rate of HNPCC diagnosis in affected families [10]. To date, only a few studies have tested the association between HNPCC and oral manifestations [12–14].Dento-osseous anomalies such as osteomas, dense bone island, odontomas, and supernumerary and impacted teeth are also proliferative benign lesions related to dento-osseous development and they are well documented in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [20, 21]. To our knowledge, dento-osseous alterations have not been previously reported in individuals with HNPCC. A weighted scoring system to evaluate dento-osseous anomalies known as Dental Panoramic Radiograph Score (DPRS) was proposed by some authors to diagnose FAP. In their study, the test took into consideration the nature, extent, and site of osseous and dental changes on dental panoramic radiographs [22]. The significance of the findings was determined by assigning a specific range of values of DPRS. With a DPRS≥7, the specificity and positive predictive rate was 100%, and a false positive rate of 0% was obtained [22]. Therefore, DPRS was found to be a reproducible and valid index for assessing the diagnostic significance of dento-osseous changes in individuals at 50% risk of FAP, even when performed by relatively inexperienced examiners [23]. This scoring system has never been tested in individuals with HNPCC.Establishing the diagnosis for HNPCC poses a challenge and requires knowledge and vigilance [24]. The study of oral findings might be helpful in the development of a noninvasive and inexpensive test for recognizing individuals with HNPCC. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to verify oral manifestations and to investigate dento-osseous anomalies applying the DPRS system in a family case series diagnosed with HNPCC.","Twenty members of one family with HNPCC (11 men and 9 women) belonging to three generations were examined. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (number: 099/2008) of our institution. A written informed consent was obtained from all examined family members. The individuals were analyzed according to the presence of CRC and the occurrence of FGs and dento-osseous anomalies. Their average age was 29.6 (range 7 to 53 years) years. Firstly, the diagnosis of the case index was established. Then, the other 19 members of the family were examined by the Coloproctology Division of our hospital, in order to determine whether individuals presented HNPCC according to the Amsterdam Criteria I and II [5]. Afterwards, a questionnaire with personal data (age, sex), overall health and diagnosis of HNPCC, CRC and extracolon cancer was filled for each individual.Then, all individuals were referred to our Oral Care Center for Inherited Diseases for intraoral examinations to verify the presence of FGs. Dental panoramic radiographs were done in order to describe dento-osseous anomalies on applying the Dental Panoramic Radiograph System. Their oral cavities were examined using artificial light and their oral mucosal surfaces were evaluated with a focus on the identification of FGs. Dental panoramic radiographs were taken from individuals with HNPCC and their relatives. The dento-osseous alterations were evaluated on dental panoramic radiographs using the DPRS, developed by Thakker et al.[22]. In this analysis, the following anomalies were evaluated: dense bone islands, hazy sclerosis, osteomas, odontomas, supernumerary teeth and unerupted teeth following the criteria proposed by the aforementioned authors [22]. Single scores were given to each dento-osseous alteration observed in the radiographs depending on the number and size of the anomaly. An overall DPRS was determined for each individual by the addition of each single score. The final score indicates one of four possible outcomes: normal (0 to 2), minimal changes (3 to 4), equivocal changes (5 to 6) and significant changes (≥7). The radiographs were evaluated blind to the HNPCC diagnosis and in consensus by three oral and maxillofacial radiologists on a flat viewing box under dimmed lighting.The pedigree of the studied family showed HNPCC inherited in an autosomal dominant mode (Figure 1). The main characteristics of all studied individuals are summarized in Table 1.Four individuals had the diagnosis of HNPCC. All of these patients presented FGs and one had a significant dento-osseous anomaly (hazy diffuse sclerosis), as follows below:Case 1 – A 49-year-old Brazilian woman (Case index, III:5, Figure 1) presented HNPCC and CRC. FGs were found in her upper lip (Figure 2). Dento-osseous anomalies were not found in the dental panoramic radiograph of this patient.Figure 1

FGs were found only in his upper lip. The DPRS analysis showed a significant dento-osseous anomaly (≥7) due to a hazy diffuse sclerosis.Case 3 – A 47-year-old Brazilian man (III:11) presented HNPCC, CRC and an extracolon associated tumor (hepatic cancer). FGs were found in his upper lip, and the DPRS analysis did not demonstrate dento-osseous anomalies.Case 4 – A 37-year-old Brazilian man (III:12) had HNPCC and CRC, and the presence of FGs in his upper lip. Furthermore, no dento-osseous anomalies were found in the radiographic examination.Other than these four individuals with HNPCC described above, 25% (4 individuals) of the unaffected family members also presented FGs. Three individuals had FGs located both in the upper lip and oral mucosa, and one had FGs only in the oral mucosa.Regarding dento-osseous anomalies, besides the affected individual with HNPCC (III:10, Figure 1), an unaffected family member (III:2, Figure 1) also presented a significant DPRS due to a hazy diffuse sclerosis (Table 1).","In this study, 20 members of a Brazilian family with HNPCC were evaluated and oral examinations were performed with a focus on FGs and dento-osseous anomalies. HNPCC was diagnosed in four individuals and all four presented FGs in their upper lip whereas significant DPRS was observed only in one of these patients. Moreover, considering the whole sample (20 family members), FGs and significant DPRS were found in 40% and 10%, respectively.De Felice et al.[10] published the first study that assessed a possible association between FGs in the oral mucosa and HNPCC. In their study, FGs were found to be approximately 50 to 90 times higher in individuals with HNPCC than in controls. They suggested that FGs could be a new phenotypic marker of families with HNPCC [10]. Our results are in agreement with their results and reinforce their proposition that clinical observation of FGs could increase the rate of HNPCC diagnosis in affected families. In our study, all individuals with HNPCC presented FGs, whereas FGs were observed in 25% of the unaffected family members. Our percentage of unaffected family members with FGs is slightly higher than the 20.9% frequency reported in a previous Brazilian study [19], although our results may be underestimated given that 50% of the unaffected individuals are children or teenagers. Considering only post-puberty family members, the frequency of FGs increased to 50%; it is higher than the prevalence previously reported in general individuals (Table 2) [16–19]. Because 25% of the unaffected family members also presented FGs (and 50% of the adults), this oral manifestation cannot still be considered a pathognomonic feature of HNPCC.Table 2

Dento-osseous anomalies associated with FAP disease are well reported in the literature [20]; however, they have not been related to individuals with HNPCC. Significant dento-osseous anomalies were observed in two family members, although only one had HNPCC diagnosis. Four other individuals without HNPCC presented minimal dento-osseous anomalies, nevertheless these results may be due to the amount of young individuals in this family, and some dento-osseous anomalies may have an age-dependent appearance. A previous study suggested that a DPRS test is more likely to be informative when performed in an older group of individuals [22]. Therefore, follow-up of the youngest individuals is recommended. Dento-osseous anomalies may be found in the general population. However, the lack of data in the literature regarding the prevalence of these dento-osseous anomalies precluded a direct comparison with our results.It is important to draw attention to the relationship between CRC and oral findings. In our study, all individuals who had CRC presented FGs and DPRS equal to zero. In contrast, individuals with significant DPRS did not have CRC, yet one had HNPCC. On the one hand, this could suggest that individuals with FGs have higher risk to develop CRC, on the other hand, individuals with significant DPRS have a lower risk. More studies with a larger number of individuals and families are necessary though to confirm this proposition.","In summary, in the present familial study, FGs were observed as a feature in all individuals with HNPCC diagnosis. In addition, dento-osseous anomalies were found in the family with HNPCC; however, the relationship between HNPCC and dento-osseous anomalies was not clearly established. More studies with a larger case series are necessary to confirm these findings."
2,Liver metastasis originating from colorectal cancer with macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombosis: a case report and review of the literature,"Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a reported incidence of PVTT of 30% to 70% [1–3]. A recent pathological study of metastatic liver cancer originating from colorectal cancer found microscopic tumor invasion in the intra-hepatic portal vein to be a relatively common finding in addition to HCC [4, 5]. However, macroscopic tumor thrombi occupying the main portal branch are rare in patients with liver metastasis [6, 7], including that from colorectal cancer (Table 1) [8–14].Table 1 Previously reported cases with macroscopic portal vein thrombus (PVTT) from successfully resected colorectal cancersFull size table
We report on a case of liver metastasis from colon cancer with macroscopic tumor thrombi in the right portal branch. Herein, we describe the case and review the literature for liver metastases from colorectal cancer accompanied by macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombi.","A 55-year-old Japanese man underwent a right hemicolectomy in our hospital for a tumor in the ascending colon.. He did not have any inherited or acquired thrombophilic predispositions. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and staged as IIIB (T4N1M0), according to the TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) classification [15]. Tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were all within normal limits before the operation. During follow-up in our outpatient clinic, our patient received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for six months.Despite the adjuvant treatment, abdominal computed tomography (CT) 13 months after surgery showed a liver tumor in segment 8 based on Couinaud's classification [16]. Our patient was subsequently readmitted to our hospital for full diagnosis and treatment of the liver tumor. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis C antibody test results were negative. Tumor markers including CEA, CA19-9, α-fetoprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II, were all within normal limits. CT arteriography (CTA) showed a tumor of approximately 25 mm in diameter consisting of two components: an apparently solid part and a cystic component. The solid component of the tumor was enhanced in the early phase of the CTA and was washed out in the delayed phase, a pattern compatible with HCC (Figure 1A). However, based on the cystic component, the tumor was also suspected to be a cystadenocarcinoma. The right portal vein was not visible on portography, but CT during arterial portography (CTAP) revealed defective portal perfusion in the whole right lobe of the liver (Figure 1C). This finding was suggestive of PVTT. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed to differentiate cystadenocarcinoma connected to a biliary duct. However, no specific findings of biliary carcinoma were noted and the collected bile sample was cytologically negative. For preoperative differential diagnosis of the tumor, echo-guided biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed that the liver tumor was a liver metastasis from the colon cancer. With a preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis from colon cancer, laparotomy was performed. Neither peritoneal dissemination nor hilar lymph node metastasis was detected. The liver tumor, measuring 28 × 25 mm in size, was located in segment 8, while PVTT was located in the right portal vein in direct communication with the liver tumor. Our patient underwent a right lobectomy (Figure 2A). The resected tumor, which had a fibrotic capsule, macroscopically resembled HCC. The cystic component observed on preoperative examination was not detected in the resected specimen. Histopathology of the resected liver tumor and PVTT revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (Figure 2B). The histopathological findings from the resected tumor were similar to the previously resected ascending colon cancer. Based on the similarity, the final diagnosis for the liver tumor was a liver metastasis from the ascending colon cancer accompanied by macroscopic PVTT in the right portal branch. Histopathological infiltration into the endothelial layer of the portal vein was not seen. All resected margins were free from cancer. Postoperatively, our patient agreed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Our patient remains healthy, with no evidence of recurrence 51 months after the hepatectomy.Figure 1

","Microscopic tumor invasion into the intra-hepatic portal vein is detected in about 20% of cases with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer [4]. However, our review of previously reported cases revealed few instances of PVTT in the main portal branch [8–14]. In fact, the reported incidence of macroscopic PVTT similar to that observed in our case report is 2.8% (4 of 142) [9]. From January 1990 to December 2008, 231 patients underwent resection of liver metastases from primary colorectal cancer in our hospital. Of these patients, only our patient's case showed macroscopic PVTT (0.4%).Macroscopic examination of the resected tumor in our patient did not show the preoperatively detected cystic component of the tumor. It is possible that necrotic fluid, having filled the cystic component, was absorbed and thus replaced by the tumor before removal. The resected liver tumor and PVTT macroscopically resembled HCC, which commonly develops tumor thrombi and expansive growth in the portal vein and in the hepatic vein [17]. The capsule formation of HCC is possibly the result of mechanical compression or high inner pressure from the expansive tumor growth, thus it is also feasible that tumor thrombi might extend into the portal vein via a pressure gradient mechanism [18]. In contrast, liver metastases from colorectal cancer are generally less commonly surrounded by a capsule compared to HCC, with one study detecting encapsulated liver metastases from colorectal cancer in only 20% of cases [19]. The resected tumor in our patient, which was encapsulated, also resembled HCC in this point of the capsule formation. This resemblance to HCC may suggest that the PVTT in this case might have also expanded into the portal vein through a pressure gradient mechanism, as in HCC.Table 1 summarizes 15 reported cases of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer with macroscopic PVTT, including our patient. No specific clinical features typified patients with colorectal liver metastasis and PVTT with respect to age, gender, or the primary tumor site. With regard to the stage of the primary colorectal cancer, all the primary colorectal lesions recorded were divided into T3 or T4 according to the TNM classification [15], and lymph node metastasis was found in most of the cases (12 of 14, 86%). In 12 of the 15 cases (80%), liver metastasis was accompanied by PVTT, and the liver tumor was relatively large (60 ± 37 mm; range, 25 to 145 mm). PVTT was found metachronously in 12 patients, and synchronously with the primary tumor in the remaining three patients. Although Matsumoto et al.[14] suggested that survival after the operation of PVTT from colorectal cancer might depend on whether the PVTT had developed synchronously or metachronously, this suggestion seems not to be applied to the review in the present study. With regards to the liver tumor, anatomical liver resection was performed in all 15 patients. The one-year, three-year and five-year overall survival rates in the 15 cases after operation for PVTT were 64.3%, 51.4%, and 51.4%, respectively. Since this analysis was performed only in a limited number of patients, specifically successful cases, the analysis did not allow a precise general prognosis to be determined for metastatic liver tumor with PVTT. However, even if the aforementioned success bias was taken into consideration, this outcome seems to be relatively good. In general, anatomical liver resection is not usually employed for colorectal liver metastasis in contrast to HCC [20–22]. However, considering that colorectal liver metastasis with PVTT is likely to spread along the portal tributaries as in HCC, it may be speculated that anatomical liver resection, which is suitable for such liver metastasis, contributes to the favorable prognosis for colorectal liver metastasis with PVTT, as suggested by some investigators [9, 10, 14]. Today, some treatment options for colorectal liver metastasis have been established including surgery, ablation therapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, but there is no consensus for the treatment for colorectal liver metastasis accompanying PVTT. This successful case is not enough to conclude that surgery is the best treatment option for such liver metastasis, but we suggest at least that macroscopic PVTT is not a contraindication to liver surgery.","Our patient had a successfully resected liver metastasis from colorectal cancer with macroscopic PVTT. The prognosis of patients with such PVTT remains unclear, but from previous reports it would appear a better prognosis can be expected if the tumor is successfully resected by anatomical liver resection."
