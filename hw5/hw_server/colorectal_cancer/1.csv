0,Genome wide association identified colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and colorectal cancer risk in Lynch syndrome,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several common low-risk variants for colorectal cancer. Although some of the GWAS were enriched for young onset and family history positive colorectal cancer cases, it is not clear if these variants modify colorectal cancer risk for people with Lynch syndrome. In a case-unaffected sibling analysis of population and clinic based sibships, a study by Poynter et al. (2007) found a stronger association for risk variants in the 8q24 region (rs10505477 and rs6983627) with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors. MSI-high tumors are characteristic of Lynch syndrome. Therefore we hypothesize that these variants may also influence colorectal cancer risk in Lynch syndrome. Recently Wijnen et al. (2009) have reported on some of the GWAS risk variants in Dutch Lynch syndrome families and although they did not find an association between rs6983627 and colorectal cancer risk, other risk variants in 8q24 and 9p24 have yet to be characterized in Lynch syndrome.",In a retrospective cohort study design we analyzed 267 Lynch syndrome subjects from the M. D. Anderson Lynch syndrome registry with a proven DNA mismatch repair gene mutation. We genotyped 3 risk variants: 8q24 (rs10505477: T>C and rs6983627: T>G) and 9p24 (rs719725: A>C) and used Cox proportional hazards regression (Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals) to analyze the association between each of the risk variants and colorectal cancer risk while adjusting for sex and familial correlation.,"Of the 267 subjects from 120 families with 11767 person years of follow-up, 138 had colorectal cancer and the remaining was unaffected. We modeled each of the 3 variants as codominant, additive and recessive but none of them were associated with colorectal cancer risk in our cohort.","Although the GWAS identified colorectal cancer risk variants are potential modifiers of colorectal cancer risk in Lynch syndrome, it is possible that the lack of association seen in our data is due to our study being underpowered to detect the modest association typically associated with these common variants. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to confirm presence or true lack of an association."
1,Colorectal adenomas and cancer link to chromosome 13q22.1-13q31.3 in a large family with excess colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. Approximately 5% of colon cancers arise in the presence of a clear hereditary cancer condition; however, current estimates suggest that an additional 15-25% of colorectal cancers arise on the basis of unknown inherited factors. Association studies report several low-penetrance genetic variants associated with colon cancer risk. Large families, whereby precise inheritance can be correlated with phenotype, offer another approach to identify moderately penetrant genes and to isolate responsible genetic loci and mutations. The aim of this study was to identify additional genetic factors responsible for colon cancer using large multigenerational pedigrees with excess colorectal cancer.","A large 4-generation kindred with statistical excess colorectal cancer was identified through the Utah Population Database. 47 family members were enrolled and evaluated clinically by colonoscopy. Genome-wide genotyping was done using two sets of genetic markers: 325 short tandem repeat (STR) and the10K Affymetrix SNP array, as well as fine mapping with 5 additional STR markers. Parametric and nonparametric linkage was analyzed using MLINK and GENEHUNTER.","A major genetic locus segregating with colonic polyps and cancer in this kindred was identified on chromosome 13q with a nonparametric linkage score of26.39 (LOD score of 2.99 and p=0.0006). The nonrecombinant region spans 21 Mbp and contains 27 RefSeq genes. Sequencing of 7 candidate genes in this region failed to identify a clearly deleterious mutation; however, polymorphisms segregating with the phenotype were identified. Chromosome 13q is commonly gained and over expressed in colon cancers and is correlated with metastasis suggesting the presence of an oncogene. Evaluation of a tumor from a kindred member revealed a gain of 13q as well.",This identified region may contain a novel oncogene responsible for colon cancer in a yet to be determined fraction of the colon cancer population. Identification of the precise gene and causative genetic change will be an important next step to understand cancer progression and metastasis.
2,Rectal cancer in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: Surgical management and survival outcomes,"Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is hallmarked by microsatellite instability. The prognosis of HNPCC-related colon cancer is well characterized, but little is known about rectal cancers. The aim of this study was to report the long-term outcomes of HNPCC-related rectal cancer where current-era multimodality therapy was utilized.","Patients referred to our institution for either primary or recurrent rectal cancer between 1992-2010 were identified based on following inclusion criteria: 1) pathogenic germline mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR; n=19); 2) germline variants of uncertain significance but tumor studies suggestive of MMR (n=6); 3) suggestive tumor studies but negative germline testing (n=5); and 4) suggestive tumor studies but no germline testing (n=4). Patients were reviewed for clinical characteristics and treatments, and followed to death or last contact.","Among the 34 patients, 21 (62%) were female. The median age at diagnosis of rectal cancer was 40 (range: 20-72). In 28 patients (82%), this was the index cancer leading to the diagnosis of HNPCC, and in 22 patients (65%), this was their first malignancy. Only a minority satisfied Amsterdam I (21%) or Amsterdam II (21%) criteria, while nearly all (94%) met the revised Bethesda criteria. Pathogenic mutations included MLH1 (15%), MSH2 (32%) and MSH6 (9%). The majority (67%) presented with locally advanced (T3/T4 and/or node positive, n=20) or metastatic disease (n=3), and 50% received neoadjuvant radiation with 5-FU based chemotherapy. Final pathologic stages are as outlined below. Patients underwent proctectomy (65%), total/near total coloproctectomy (21%), transanal excision (9%), and chemoradiation only (3%). Multivisceral resection was required in 9 patients (28%) and adjuvant therapy was given in 24 (71%). After a median followup of 4.1 years, 94% were alive. Six patients developed local-regional (n=3) or distant (n=3) disease recurrence, and 5 underwent successful surgical salvage. Metachronous CRC was found in 4 patients (12%) after a median of 8 years (range: 3.2-17), and all were amenable to surgical resection. The estimated 5-year freedom from recurrent or metachronous CRC was 76%. The 5-year overall survival was 93%, which was preserved at 10-years. Table 1.Table 1Full size table
","Rectal cancer may present as the index cancer for HNPCC over a wide age range. Despite advanced stages at presentation, excellent long-term prognosis can be expected with aggressive multimodality therapy. Vigilant surveillance for recurrent or metachronous CRC should be carried out over a prolonged time period to allow for repeat surgical salvage and preserved long-term survival."
3,Family history scoring system shows Familial Colorectal Cancer Type X syndrome individuals and Amsterdam I individuals have comparable risk for developing colon cancer,A points-based scoring system defines levels of familial risk for colorectal neoplasia. More than 7 points defines a high-risk group that should undergo colonoscopy every 3 years. Family History Scoring was applied to families fulfilling Amsterdam I criteria and familial colorectal cancer type X to compare colon cancer risk.,"Amsterdam I (AmI) and familial type X (famX) families identified from Jagelman Registry database were scored. Affected probands (AP), unaffected probands (UP), affected sibling (AS), and unaffected sibling (US) of the proband, and a child of each sibling were scored. Median, range, and standard deviation were compared for each syndrome to determine level of risk.","200 patients were included. 181 matched AmI criteria with genetic testing, 19 matched criteria for famX. 37 families with an AP and 12 with an UP matched AmI criteria. 4 with an AP and 3 with an UP that matched criteria for famX. Level of risk for the two syndromes were compared (Table 1). Median family history score was 12 points for individuals fulfilling AmI criteria and 14 for famX. Total mean was 12.8 for AmI and 13.5 for famX. Median was compared between the two syndromes (Figure 1), to assess level of risk.

","Family history scoring system has shown that families fulfilling Amsterdam I criteria and familial type X share similar familial risk level for developing colon cancer. Both show dominant inheritance, but molecular pathways differ."
4,Risks of cancers for carriers of monoallelic MUTYH mutation with a family history of colorectal cancer,Several studies have shown an increased risk of colorectal and extracolonic cancers for carriers of germline MUTYH mutations inherited from both parents (biallelic mutations). Extracolonic cancer risks for carriers of a MUTYH mutation inherited from only one parent (monoallelic mutation) have not previously been estimated.,"We identified 144 families of MUTYH mutation carriers from three countries that we ascertained through population-based sources of the multi-site, international Colon Cancer Family Registry. Mutation status, sex, age, and histories of cancer, polypectomy, and hysterectomy were sought from 2,179 of their relatives. Using Cox regression weighted to adjust for the method of ascertainment, we estimated the country-, age- and sex-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of colorectal and extracolonic cancers for monoallelic mutation carriers, compared with the general population, and corresponding age-specific cumulative risks.","Monoallelic mutation carriers with a family history of CRC had a significantly increased incidence of CRC (SIR = 2.04; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.56 – 2.70; P <0.001), gastric cancer (SIR = 3.24; 95% CI = 2.18 – 4.98; P <0.001), and endometrial cancer (SIR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.13 – 4.86; P = 0.03) and a marginal increased incidence of liver cancer (SIR = 3.09; 95% CI = 1.07 – 12.25; P = 0.07) compared to the general population. The estimated cumulative risks to age 70 years based on the population cancer incidence of the United States were as follows: for CRC, 6% (95% CI = 5 – %) for men and 4% (95% CI = 3 – 6%) for women; for gastric cancer, 2% (95% CI = 1 – 3%) for men and 0.7% (95% CI = 0.5 – 1%) for women; for liver cancer, 1% (95% CI = 0.3 – 3%) for men and 0.3% (95% CI = 0.1 – 1%) for women; and for endometrial cancer, 4% (95% CI = 2 – 8%). There was no evidence of increased risks for cancer of the brain, pancreas, kidney, lung, breast or prostate.","Monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers with a family history of CRC are at increased risk of colorectal, gastric, liver and endometrial cancers."
5,Applying Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in the context of HTA: an experimental case study on metastatic colorectal cancer,There is increased recognition that economic evaluation has limitations because it does not capture a number of important dimensions of value. This may lead to a lack of comprehensiveness and a lack of transparency.,Past research has indicated that Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) could be used as an alternative methodology for assessing the value of new medical technologies in the context of Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The objective of this study is to apply in practice an MCDA framework for the value assessment of a set of therapeutic options in metastatic colorectal cancer through a simulation exercise based on MCDA principles.,"A process to inform the value assessment of new medical technologies which, in turn, can help determine coverage decisions and possibly pricing mechanisms.","All stages of the framework were informed by extensive stakeholder engagement through their participation at a decision conference workshop. Stakeholders (13 in total) included health care professionals (e.g. clinical experts), methodology experts (e.g. health economists) and patient advocates (e.g. patients and carers), while adopting the perspective of a decision-making HTA body."
6,A predictive model of metachronous colorectal cancer occurrence in Lynch syndrome,"Lynch Syndrome (LS) correlated colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients show a tendency towards the development of multiple and metachronous lesions and, for this reason, a surgical prophylactic treatment, as total colectomy, is warranted. Considering the quality of life of patients treated with total colectomy, it is essential to determine risk factors of metachronous CRC. Aim of the study was to evaluate through a predictive model the patients that could really benefit from a surgical prevention.","We considered LS or suspected LS CRC patients enrolled by our Institutional Register of Hereditary Colorectal Tumors and submitted to a surgical resection of CRC, excluding those who had a total colectomy. Patients were characterized according to their genotype (MLH I, MSH2 and MSH6), sex and clinical features (age at diagnosis, tumour site, stage, grading, presence of colorectal adenomas and of extracolonic cancers) and were stratified in 4 mutually exclusive groups according to family characteristics: A) MMR gene mutation positive; B) Amsterdam criteria (ACI-II) positive, but mutation negative; C) AC-like and D) high risk. In order to identify a model for predicting metachronous CRC occurrence, for each patients' group a stepwise unconditional logistic regression model was fitted. All the regression equation included terms for gender, age in continuous as blocked terms. The predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).","A total of 1,604 CRC patients (M/F=1.02, 16.5% <40 yrs old) were considered (600 in group A, 117 B, 530 C and 357 D). During the follow-up, 181 developed metachronous CRC (11 %) and 354 (22%) an extracolonic cancer. The risks of metachronous CRC at 10 years were 21%, 16%, 16%, and 14% for group A, B, C and D, respectively. The predictive variables in the final model comprised for each group were: A) MLHI mutation, the presence of colorectal adenomas and then occurrence of extracolonic cancers, B) occurrence of extracolonic cancers, C) high tumor grade and presence of colorectal adenomas. No significant predictors were identified for group D. AUC values, as a measure of discrimination of the various models, were 0.72, 0.78 and 0.76 for group A, B and C, respectively.",Metachronous CRC is a long-term moderate risk in LS patients. This suggests to recommend a prophylactic colectomy only to selected patients with well defined characteristics.
7,Colorectal cancer risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and Lynch syndrome,"Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Lynch syndrome (LS) are associated with an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). After 8-10 years of pan-ulcerative colitis (DC), the risk of CRC is 2%, increasing by 0.5-1.0% annually. LS has been associated with a 60-80% lifetime risk of CRC. It is unclear whether individuals diagnosed with both IBD and LS would have a cumulative risk or earlier age of onset of CRC based on their diagnoses.","Patients with IBD and a germline mismatch repair gene (MMR) mutation were identified through the Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Information on their IBD diagnosis, colorectal screening/surgery, medication use, family history and genetic test results were collected (Table 1).Table 1Full size table
",Five of 329 (1.5%) individuals with germline MMR mutations reported having a history of IBD.,Concurrent IBD and LS did not appear to predispose to early-onset CRC in our small case series.
8,How do individuals decide whether to accept or decline an offer of genetic testing for colorectal cancer?,"Since 1997, the Victorian Colorectal Cancer Family Study (VCCFS) has been studying a large number of individuals who have had colorectal cancer and their relatives. When a genetic mutation is identified by the VCCFS, family members are offered the chance to have genetic testing through a family cancer clinic to learn of their result. Between 17% (before August 2003) and 49% (after August 2003) of individuals offered genetic testing decline the offer [1], providing a unique opportunity to conduct research with individuals who decline genetic testing. Understanding this decision making process is critical to improving the uptake of genetic testing in practice [2].",A sample of participants in the VCCFS who had been offered genetic testing between 2003 and 2008 were invited to take part in a qualitative interview about genetic testing decision-making in the area of colorectal cancer. The sample included both those who declined genetic testing (decliners) and those who accepted genetic testing (acceptors). Thematic analysis was performed to determine the main reason individuals gave for accepting or declining the offer of genetic testing.,"A total of 15 interviews have been conducted, six with decliners, and nine with acceptors. All participants recalled the offer of genetic information, and knew of the hereditary genetic mutation in their family. Each participant was able to clearly describe their decision. There were four types of decliners and four types of acceptors. Individuals declined because 1) Lynch Syndrome had been confirmed by other means; 2) fear about insurance implications; 3) genetic testing ‘wouldn’t change anything’ or 4) a positive result would cause too much worry. The main reason individuals accepted the offer of genetic testing was for the sake of 1) their children; 2) their own health; 3) curiosity; or 4) research. We consider how this decision was related to both risk perception and screening behaviour.","The key perception informing the genetic testing decision was the consequence of receiving results. In the case of decliners, receiving genetic results was perceived to have either no consequences or negative consequences (financial or emotional). For acceptors, genetic testing was perceived to have positive consequences either for their children, themselves, or society. This research highlights the need to explore risk perceptions, genetic testing and screening decision making in more detail in families eligible for genetic testing, in order to increase the uptake of genetic testing in this group."
9,Results of a pilot study to improve identification and referral for people at high risk for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes,"Five percent of colorectal cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes for which genetic testing is clinically available. Effective surveillance strategies and risk-reducing surgeries lower risk for people diagnosed with inherited colorectal cancer syndromes. However, from a public health standpoint, the existence of effective interventions is futile if not applied broadly and appropriately to the population at risk. Efficient identification of people with hereditary risk remains a challenge, and failure to systematically identify people at high hereditary risk results in preventable morbidity and mortality. The William C. Bernstein M.D. Familial Cancer Registry (Bernstein Registry) is a research-based program that triages participants for hereditary cancer risk. Self-reported family histories are assessed and participants are given tailored information about their hereditary risk factors. People at high risk are given information about the availability and advisability of clinical genetics services. Pilot populations are being enrolled to establish registry processes and determine the feasibility of implementation at a population-based level. This pilot group includes volunteers from a previously established colorectal cancer registry.","A 7-item screening questionnaire determines potential eligibility for the Bernstein Registry using elements of early onset, multiple primary and family history of cancers. Potentially eligible participants are contacted by telephone and a four-generation cancer history is generated via guided interview. Pedigrees are analyzed by genetic counselors for hereditary cancer risk probabilities based on published guidelines. Targeted, tailored risk information is provided in writing along with a copy of the family tree. A list of genetic counseling service providers is included for people at high risk.","Four hundred sixty six (466) of 898 people (52%) in the Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative (MCCI) registry have histories eligible for the Bernstein registry. To date, 437 invitations have been mailed to this group, 55% responded. Of 242 completed eligibility screeners, 239 proved eligible (99%), and 155 (64%) have enrolled. Of 55 completed assessments, 44 have been classified as high risk, with genetic counseling/testing recommended.","The Bernstein Registry can systematically determine who may benefit from clinical genetics services (genetic counseling and testing). A majority of individuals from families previously identified as high risk are motivated to participate in research and tolerate the relatively onerous enrollment process. Whether this same population will follow through on recommendations to pursue genetic counseling and testing, and whether the intensive risk-identification process is feasible and sustainable on a public health level is the target of future research."
10,Deciphering the molecular pathways disrupted in normal and neoplastic colonic tissue in inherited colorectal cancer syndromes,Genetic profiling by RNA microarray of normal and neoplastic colonic tissue is used to identify biomarkers for development of a diagnostic tool for the inherited colon cancer syndromes. The utility of this method is to 1) properly classify patients where genetic diagnosis is incomplete 2) suggest molecular pathways that are shared between the syndromes and 3) identify molecular targets for prevention and treatment.,"RNA was extracted from fresh colonic biopsies obtained during endoscopy. Agilent 44K whole genome microarrays were run on 7-10 normal and neoplastic sample pairs from control, FAP, AFAP, Cowden syndrome, hyperplastic polyposis (HPP), and HNPCC (normal tissue only) patients. Microarray data were normalized, log-transformed, and analyzed for > 1.2 fold differential expression using GeneSifter software with a t-test adjusted by the Benjamini and Hochberg method. The most significant 100 mRNA probes were selected for evaluation. Select genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Pathway analysis was done using prior knowledge resources including Genespring, KEGG and Cytoscape with microarray derived models.","The most significant 100 of 44,000 probes gave adjusted p-values < 3x10-4. Within this subset, the mRNAs from causative genes are decreased in normal colonic tissue from Cowden syndrome (PTEN), HNPCC (MLH1), and AFAP (APC) patients, but not from FAP (APC) patients, suggesting the presence of unstable mRNA and a molecular level of haploinsufficiency. The largest increased expression in HNPCC vs. controls included three genes with plekstrin homology domains (TRIOBP, PLEKHF1, FGD1), and two of these are also increased in Cowden syndrome (PLEKHF1, FGD1) along with SMAD5. There appear to be parallels between FAP and HPP. Normal HPP tissue has a decrease in NKD2 which is a negative regulator of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. Normal FAP (vs. control) and HPP polyp (vs. normal) demonstrate a disruption in MEKK4 (MAP3K4)-ANXA2-PLG-MMP7 pathways. Additionally the proto-oncogene, MET, is up-regulated in FAP and AFAP normal as well as HPP polyp tissues. MET is a tyrosine kinase HGF receptor; mutations are associated with hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and it resides in a genetic region associated with common familial colon cancer. This gene may have a central role in predisposing cells for a proliferative phenotype as it interacts with beta-catenin pathway.","Deciphering the molecular signatures of the inherited colon cancer syndromes has revealed, and will continue to reveal, interesting clues into pathways that are differentially regulated in normal colonic tissue, and those are altered during the neoplastic process."
11,Linking of Utah genealogies to outpatient colonoscopy records defines familial aggregation of colorectal polyps and cancer,"The Utah Population Database (UPDB) is a shared research resource of the University of Utah. It combines Utah genealogies dating back to the 1700s with data from statewide resources, including a cancer registry, hospital claims, as well as birth and death certificates. A project completed in 2008 linked the UPDB to patient demographic records from Intermountain Healthcare which is a non-profit medical system that serves Utah and Southeast Idaho, providing care to approximately 60% of the resident population. The availability of large numbers of linked, electronically searchable medical records offers unique opportunities for improved clinical and outcomes research. We address the question of the extent to which colonic adenomas and hyperplastic polyps co-segregate with colon cancer risk in non-syndromic families.","A pilot project was initiated to use this new linked research infrastructure by ascertaining the occurrence of colorectal polyps from Intermountain clinical data. De-identified medical information was merged with UPDB family structure and statewide cancer data. These combined data sets provided family structure along with cancer histories to investigate familial aggregation. Cox Regression Analysis was used to assess the relative risk of (a) polyp development and (b) colon cancer for first-, second-and third-degree relatives, by polyp type. Custom kinship analysis tools allowed determination of the excess polyp and cancer risk observed in the kindreds of each case, and differentiated high-risk from population-risk families.","The queries captured data from over 70,000 positive outpatient colonoscopy procedure and pathology reports from over 58,000 de-identified individuals examined between 1995 and 2009. The queries collected data on age, gender, polyp type, number, size, pathology and were verified by manual review of a randomly selected sample of 200 cases. We identified high-risk kindreds dating to founders born in the late 1700s, with high relative risks for polyp/cancer. Analysis of discrepancies between excess polyp and excess cancer risks within families allowed us to address the possibility that some cancers may arise in the absence of significant excess polyp risk.","The combination of a large, electronically searchable medical database (and associated tissue specimens) with a linked genealogical resource offers a powerful platform for the development of hypothesis-driven research."
12,Audit of routine immunohistochemistry testing for mismatch repair proteins at diagnosis of colorectal cancer under the age of 50,"In May 2007, the Victorian Cancer Oncology Hereditary Bowel Cancer Group (VCOG HBCG) released a position statement in regards to the identification of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing. This was based on the consensus among clinical groups, that most families with HNPCC are not being identified and strategies to improve identification should be implemented. The VCOG HBCG recommendations was to test all colorectal cancers in patients under 50 years of age by IHC for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins, as part of the routine pathological assessment of cancers presenting in these patients, without direct consent. This recommendation was supported by the Australian College of Pathologists and widely circulated to the clinical community from 2007.The primary purpose of this audit was to ascertain the frequency of IHC being performed for consecutive patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer under 50 years of age, at three Victorian hospitals since the publication of the VCOG HBCG position statement. The purpose of this audit was also to ascertain the number of cases where IHC results showed loss of expression, which were referred to the Familial Cancer Centre (FCC) for further assessment and the outcome of this assessment.","Lists of patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed under 50 years of age for the calendar years of 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were extracted from each hospital database. Pathology reports for all patients were manually checked to assess cancer site, stage, mucinous component, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and whether IHC was performed. Those patients with IHC absent results were cross-checked with FCC databases to see whether they were referred for further evaluation and what the outcome of attendance had been.","Data from three hospitals is presented. 204 patients were diagnosed with CRC under 50 years of age from Jan 2007 to Aug 2010. 164 had IHC testing as part of routine management: 67.5% (27/40) in 2007, 69.8% (44/63) in 2008, 66.6% (36/54) in 2009 and 72% (36/50) in 2010. One hospital showed a greater increment in rate of IHC uptake over time. This hospital changed its synoptic pathology report to include IHC.","There were differences between hospitals in the uptake of the recommendation to implement routine IHC for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer under 50 years of age. Barriers and enablers were identified for initiating routine IHC testing at the hospitals. These include addressing concerns about consent and onus of consent acquisition if needed, confusion about whether the IHC testing is a genotype or phenotype test, translation of the findings to clinical practice, establishment and optimization of the IHC testing, and funding of IHC testing."
