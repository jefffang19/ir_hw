0,"Genome characteristics of primary carcinomas, local recurrences, carcinomatoses, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer patients","More than a decade ago, a genetic model for the adenoma–carcinoma sequence in the large bowel was presented by Fearon and Vogelstein [1]. It is now widely accepted that colorectal cancer (CRC) arises through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes [2]. The order as well as the number of events are important in the process that transform normal cells into neoplastic precursors and subsequently into malignant tumors, which may further metastasize [3]. Inactivation of tumorsupressor genes, APC and TP53, as well as components of mismatch repair system, is commonly found in colorectal tumors. A recent study suggest alternative molecular pathways for colorectal carcinomas based on the observation that APC, KRAS2, and TP53 are all frequently mutated but rarely in the same tumor [4]. Twelve to fifteen percent of all primary colorectal carcinomas display microsatellite instability [5–8], a result of defect mismatch repair [9]. The majority of colorectal carcinomas, however, harbor numerous aberrations at the chromosome level, and chromosomal instability seems to be pronounced in these tumors [2]. This type of instability may be caused by varying mechanisms, including telomer dysfunction, defect DNA double-strand break repair and disturbances during chromosome segregation [10].The genomes of hundreds of primary colorectal carcinomas have now been studied by conventional chromosomal banding technique as well as by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) [11–28]. These studies have revealed a nonrandom pattern of genomic abnormalities in primary carcinomas, including frequent gain of material from chromosomes and chromosome arms 7, 8q, 13, and 20, and losses from 4, 8p, 14, 17p, and 18q. However, in spite of the fact that metastases are usually the ultimate cause of death in CRC patients [29], the cytogenetic changes that characterize and presumably drive the advanced stages of this disease have been poorly described [reviewed in [25, 30]]. We have recently analyzed 17 CRC liver metastases, combining chromosome banding with CGH, and found that the former technique, in contrast to CGH profiles, did not always detect the cytogenetically abnormal clones [30]. The use of CGH have provided profiles of various series of liver metastases [reviewed in [30]]. To our knowledge the genome aberrations in local recurrences and peritoneal carcinomatoses from CRC patient have not previously been described. In order to identify genetic changes underlying the development of local and distant metastases, we have compared the genomes of primary CRC with those of local recurrences, peritoneal carcinomatoses, and liver metastases using a molecular cytogenetic approach.","The complete CGH profiles are presented in the supplementary Table 1 (additional data file 1). All tumors, except one primary carcinoma, three local recurrences and one liver metastasis, exhibited DNA copy number changes, and the overall copy number profiles for each tumor stage are illustrated in Fig. 1. The number of imbalances per case ranged from 0 to 28 (median, 11). Although all chromosomes were involved, the distribution of the imbalances was clearly nonrandom. The most common copy number changes, found in more than 20% of each tumor group, were gains of 7, 8q, 13q, and 20, and losses of 4q, 8p, 17p, and 18, but however, frequency variations were observed among primary tumors, local recurrences, and liver metastases (Fig. 1). Twenty tumors showed amplifications (Table 1, supplementary data, additional data file 1) in one to nine discrete regions: chromosome arms 13q (ten cases), 20q (nine cases), 8q (eight cases), 20p (six cases), 5p (one case), and chromosome X (two cases) and 7 (one case). The frequency of amplification did not differ significantly among the different tumor groups.Table 1 Imbalances of 5p and 12p in the different stages of CRC.Full size tableFigure 1Graphic comparison of the overall genomic gains (A) and losses (B) detected by CGH in different CRC stages. For each case, the presence or absence of imbalance in every chromosome band (from 1p36 to Xq28) was computed in a spreadsheet. The total number of imbalances detected in every band was then used to prepare the graphic comparison. All chromosome arms were involved in imbalances. (A) Loss of 18q was one of the most frequent aberrations seen in all groups. In addition to 18q loss, primary carcinomas and liver metastases often showed loss of 8p. Additionally, liver metastases and carcinomatoses frequently harbored loss of 4q. (B) Gain of 8q and 20q were common in all tumor types. In addition, carcinomatoses often contained gains of 5p, 7p, 9q, 12, and 13q, whereas liver metastases often showed gains of 7p, and 13q. * Multiple samples from a single tumor (case no. 53R1 and 53R2; 64C1 and 64C2; 21L1 and 21L2; 42L1 and 42L2; 52L1 and 52L2; 76L1, 76L2, and 76L3) were counted as one sample.Full size imageThe number of imbalances per case for primary carcinomas, local recurrences, carcinomatoses, and liver metastases ranged from 0 to 16 (median, 10), 0 to 17 (median, 6), 1 to 20 (median, 13), and 0 to 28 (median, 14), respectively. Increased copy numbers of chromosome arms 5p and 12p were significantly more frequent in the carcinomatoses than in the other lesions, except the association for 5p between carcinomatoses and primary carcinomas (Table 1).A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed for the colorectal tumors based on the gains and losses from all chromosome arms (Fig. 2). No chromosome changes seemed to be tumor-stage specific. Furthermore, a separate cluster analysis for the 37 liver metastases is illustrated in Fig. 3. The majority of the liver metastases harbored changes at 7, 8p, 13q, 17p, 18, and 20 (pink tree). The top dendogram indicates that the liver metastases can be subdivided into two main groups (red and brown trees) according to the chromosome changes, one of these subgroup is characterized by additional changes at 4q, 5q, 6p, 8q, 16 (blue tree).Figure 2Hierarchical clustering of tumors from different stages of colorectal cancer. The hierarchical clustering is based on chromosome aberrations of all chromosome arms. Chromosome arms 13p, 14p, 15p, 21p, 22p, and chromosome Y, due to high content of heterochromatin, were excluded from the cluster analysis. The chromosome arms are given in the right dendogram (gains in green and losses in blue). Each tumor sample is depicted and coded (white – primary carcinomas; yellow – local recurrence; green – peritoneal carcinomatoses; red – liver metastases) at the top of the dendogram. Each row represents the alterations from a separate chromosome arm over all tumor samples, and each column represents all changes in each tumor.Full size imageFigure 3Hierarchical clustering of liver metastases from colorectal cancer patients. The hierarchical clustering is based on chromosome aberrations of all chromosome arms. Chromosome arms 13p, 14p, 15p, 21p, 22p, and chromosome Y, due to high content of heterochromatin, were excluded from the cluster analysis. The chromosome arms are given in the right dendogram (gains in green and losses in blue). Each tumor sample is depicted at the top of the dendogram. Each row represents alterations from a separate chromosome arm over all tumor samples, and each column represents all changes in each tumor.Full size imageIn four of the five patients from whom both primary carcinomas and liver metastases were analyzed, the liver metastases had more aberrations than the corresponding primary carcinomas (Table 1, supplementary data, additional data file 1). Gains of 8q (four cases) and 20q (three cases), and losses of 8p (three cases) and 18q (three cases) were seen in both the primary carcinomas and metastatic samples, whereas gain of 7p and loss of 15q were more common in the liver metastases than in the primary carcinomas (7p: in 5 metastases versus 2 primary carcinomas; 15q: in 4 metastases versus 1 primary carcinoma).","The present study is the first CGH study of peritoneal carcinomatoses and local recurrences from CRC patients and includes one of the largest series of liver metastases analyzed. Our data provide clues to the understanding of the genetic basis of the advanced disease stages. Local recurrences are re-growth of tumor cells at the site of the primary carcinomas. We found that the median number of alterations in these tumors was lower than in the primary carcinomas. In a heterogeneous primary tumor, regrowth to a local recurrency might originate from genetically less complex cells in the primary tumor. This observation should be interpreted with caution since the analyzed primary carcinomas and local recurrences were not from the same patients, and in fact the ranges of aberrations were large for both tumor groups.Peritoneal carcinomatosis reflects the regional spread of cancer cells within the peritoneal cavity. Although carcinomatosis is not always associated with widespread visceral or extra-peritoneal disease, it almost always reflects an incurable disease [31, 32]. The present comparisons of the distribution and frequency of specific chromosomal imbalances among the different tumor stages revealed significant differences between carcinomatoses and each of the other stages of the disease regarding gains at 5p and 12p (Table 1). The frequencies of 5p gains were not significantly different between primary carcinomas and carcinomatoses (Table 1), is best explained by small sample sets. However, these chromosome aberrations are indeed quite rare in primary colorectal carcinomas as evaluated from previous studies, and among 670 cases the average frequencies for 5p and 12p gains were less than 10% each [11–23, 28, 33–40]. Summarized, the present study and the previous data, lead us to speculate that genes located at these chromosome arms are involved in development of peritoneal carcinomatoses. Although gain of 5p12-p14 was confirmed in both samples from the same patient (Fig. 4), a smallest region of overlapping gain can not determined from one case only.Figure 4Gains of 5p and 12p in carcinomatoses. Gains of 5p (samples 17C, 64C1, and 64C2) and 12p (samples 36C, 64C1, and 62C2) were clearly detected by CGH. The central line (red) in the CGH profile shows the average fluorescence ratio along the chromosome, and the flanking curves (brown) represent the 95% confidence interval. The red and the green lines represent the cut-off values, 0.83 and 1.17, respectively.Full size imageOur findings agree well with previous CGH studies of primary colorectal carcinomas and liver metastases, as the type and the frequency of copy number changes are comparable [11–23, 28, 30, 33–42]. The increasing number of aberrations found in distant metastases compared to primary carcinomas is also in line with a previous allelotype study in which we found a higher fractional allelic imbalance in liver metastases than in primary carcinomas and local recurrences [43].Some observation from the results obtained from the five primary carcinomas and their corresponding liver metastases are worth mentioning. Gain of 7p and loss of 15q were more frequent in the latter, and interestingly the three primary carcinomas that each showed one of these aberrations had synchronous liver metastases. When the present cases and those of previous reports were combined [11–23, 28, 41, 42], statistical significant frequency differences between these two stages were found (7p: 216/670 versus 74/147, P < 0.001; 15q: 114/670 versus 39/147, P < 0.001), indicating that 7p gains and 15q losses may be involved in the development of distant metastases.Losses involving chromosomes 17 and 18 were seen in 19 (31%) and 42 (69%), respectively, of the cases in the present study. These changes have been suggested to be late and important events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence [1], as they have been shown to be more frequent in carcinomas than in adenomas [24, 44, 45]. Deletions of 17p and 18q usually reflect inactivation of TP53 [1], DCC [46], MADH2, and MADH4 [46, 47]. Changes at chromosome 8, usually loss of 8p and gain of 8q, are important late events in colorectal carcinogenesis, and occur more often in carcinomas and metastases than in adenomas [15, 24, 44]. Deletions of 8p, 17p, and 18q and inactivation of their potential target genes are associated with short survival [48, 49], again supporting their important role in the disease progression.The present study showed that gains of 13q and 20q are also frequent in the late stages of CRC (73% and 89%, respectively). Increased copy number of chromosome arm 13q, often reflecting trisomy of chromosome 13, is also found as the sole aberration in colorectal adenomas [25], suggesting this to be an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis. Gain of 20q is an aberration frequently seen in carcinomas and less commonly in adenomas [15]. In an assessment of the clonal composition of colorectal adenomas using FISH analyses with centromere probes, we found that 7, 13, and 20 were present with >2 signals in at least 1/3 of the adenomas [50]. This and the present results reveal a major cluster of changes in all advanced stages (containing gains of 7, 13q, 20q, and losses of 8p, 17p and 18q), one may therefore speculate that gains of 7, 13q, and 20q precede the losses of 8p, 17p, 18q, and all aberrations seem to be, in most cases, part of the clone within the primary tumor with the ability to metastasize, locally and peripheral.","A number of genetic imbalances common to all tumor groups were demonstrated, as well as consistent genetic differences among the different stages. Whereas local recurrences were genetically less complex than primary colorectal carcinomas, liver metastases and peritoneal carcinomatoses usually have more DNA copy number changes than the lesions from which they originated. Gains of 5p and 12p seem to be particularly important for the spread of CRC cells within the peritoneal cavity."
1,Palliative radiotherapy in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer,"Local recurrence of colorectal cancer after surgery occurred in 10-40% of patients [1–4]. Although local control has been improved with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), approximately 10-25% of patients still develop recurrence of disease in the pelvis [5–7]. Pelvic recurrence contributes significantly to the clinical course and is one of the major problems affecting the quality of life in these patients [8, 9].The role of primary tumor resection for non-curable stage IV colorectal cancer remains undefined. Kleespies et al. reported that palliative resection was associated with a particularly unfavorable outcome in rectal cancer patients presenting with locally advanced lesion expected macroscopic residual tumor or an extensive comorbidity [10]. Patients with prior curative resection of colorectal cancer often present with pelvic pain, one of the common manifestations of local recurrence involving nerves in the presacrum or pelvic sidewalls. The surgical approach to relieve symptomatic pain in the pelvis is usually unlikely to have negative resection margins [11]. Accordingly, resection of symptomatic pelvic tumor may be warranted only in those with adequate performance status and a resectable tumor burden with a possibly negative resection margin.RT has been considered an effective palliative treatment for patients with symptomatic pelvic tumors of colorectal cancer. Previous studies have used RT as palliative treatment to relieve pelvic symptoms in heterogeneous patients [9, 11–23]. These studies included patients with unresectable local recurrence after definitive surgery and symptomatic local recurrence with distant metastasis. Recently, modern combination chemotherapy including targeted drugs has been used to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer patients [24, 25]. Although these drugs might be effective for symptomatic palliation in responding patients, the role of RT in addition to chemotherapeutic or targeted drugs for palliation is controversial. To date, there have been few reports of the synergistic effect of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with palliative intent in gastrointestinal cancer [22, 26–30].In this study, we evaluated the palliative role of RT and defined the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with palliative RT in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer.","From August 1995 to December 2007, we retrospectively reviewed 80 patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with palliative RT at Samsung Medical Center. All patients had disease outside the pelvis and consulted a radiation oncologist for symptomatic palliation.Fifty-eight patients (73%) were initially diagnosed with rectal cancer and 22 patients (27%) with colon cancer. Seventy-two patients (90%) were treated with surgery, including 64 complete local excisions (52 curative surgeries). Eight patients (10%) received chemotherapy alone. Twenty-two patients (27%) received adjuvant RT after curative surgery or salvage RT after local recurrence. The RT dose ranged from 40Gy to 74Gy with 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction.Patient age at the time of palliative RT for symptomatic pelvic mass ranged from 27 to 85 years (median 57 years). There were 43 males (54%) and 37 females (46%). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scores were 0 in one patient (1%), 1 in 28 (35%), 2 in 36 (45%), 3 in 13 (16%), and 4 in two (3%) patients. Forty patients (50%) had single organ metastasis regardless of the number of metastatic nodules, and 40 patients (50%) had two or more organ metastases. The common metastatic sites were liver (33 patients, 41%), lung (29, 36%), paraaortic lymph node (27, 34%), and peritoneal seeding (15, 19%).Eighty patients had 95 cases of clinical symptoms. The most common clinical symptom was pain (68, 72%), followed by rectal bleeding in 18 cases (19%), and obstructive symptoms in nine cases (9%). Six patients had two concurrent symptoms, pain and bleeding (five patients) or pain and obstruction (one patient). Seven patients experienced pain recurrence after palliative RT and received palliative re-RT. In these patients, evaluation of the response to palliative re-RT was available, and all cases were independently included in the analysis of symptom response to palliative RT.RT was administered using 6-15 MV photon beams from linear accelerators. The radiation field included the recurrent mass of the pelvic cavity with 2-3 cm margins. Different RT doses were used according to the patient's performance status and extra-pelvic tumor burden. The median RT dose was 36 Gy (8-60 Gy). All patients received RT once daily, and the dose per fraction ranged from 1.8 Gy to 8.0 Gy (median 2.5 Gy). The total RT doses were converted into the biologically equivalent dose (BED) for comparison. When α/β was assumed to be 10 Gy, the median total BED was 46.8 Gy10 (14.4-78.0 Gy10).Twenty-one patients (26%) received CCRT with the following regimens: capecitabine in eight patients, fluorouracil in six patients, oral tegafur-uracil in five patients, and combination regimen in two patients. Thirty-one cases received further chemotherapy after completion of palliative RT. Patient and treatment characteristics are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Patient and treatment characteristicsFull size tableSymptom palliation was assessed one month after the completion of palliative RT. For patients with pain as the presenting symptom, effective palliation was defined as decreased or resolved pain or decreased analgesia. For patients with bleeding, effective palliation was defined as improved hemoglobin, stable hemoglobin, resolved hematochesia, or normalized hemoglobin. For patients with obstruction, effective palliation was defined as improved or resolved constipation, decreased laxative use, or no need for intervention such as a stent or colostomy.The follow-up period was defined as the time from the start of palliative RT until progression of symptom or death. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.Survival rates were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons between the groups were determined using the log-rank test [31]. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the relationships between the outcomes and possible prognostic variables using the Cox proportional hazards model [32]. The Chi-square test was used to analysis differences in patient and treatment characteristics between the symptom control group and the recurrent group. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS for Windows, version 9.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).","The median follow-up time was five months (range, 1-44 months). The overall survival rate at one year was 22.1%, and the median survival was six months. Overall symptomatic palliation was achieved in 76 of 95 cases (80%). Forty-three cases (45%) experienced recurrence of symptoms, and the median symptom control duration was five months (range, 1-44 months).In 80 patients, 68 cases had the symptom of pain; 54 cases (79%) achieved palliation of pain and 35 cases (51%) experienced reappearance of pain. Eighteen cases had the symptom of bleeding; 15 cases (83%) achieved palliation of bleeding and five cases (28%) experienced reappearance of bleeding. Nine cases had the symptom of obstruction; seven cases (78%) achieved palliation of obstruction, and three cases (33%) experienced reappearance of obstruction.Figure 1 shows symptom control rates according to initial presenting symptom. One-year symptomatic control rates were 32.1%, 69.9%, and 37.5% for pain, bleeding, and obstruction, respectively. Table 2 shows the recurrence rate after symptom palliation. BED was a statistically significant factor affecting recurrence after symptom palliation (p = 0.0011). For BED < 40 Gy10, 23 of 34 cases (68%) had recurrence and for BED ≥ 40 Gy10, and 20 of 61 cases (33%) had recurrence.Figure 1Symptom control rates according to initial presenting symptom. (a) pain, (b) bleeding, (c) obstruction.Full size imageTable 2 Symptom recurrences according to patient and treatment characteristics in patients with palliative symptom control after palliative treatment.Full size tableOn univariate analysis, the only significant prognostic factor for symptom control rate was BED (p = 0.0089), and CCRT was a marginally significant factor (p = 0.0644) (Table 3). In patients with pain, higher BED and CCRT was associated with improved outcome with statistical significance. In patients with bleeding, only higher BED was statistically significant factor. In nine patients with obstruction, there was no significant factor associated with symptom relief. Figure 2 shows differences in the symptom control rate according to BED and CCRT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of prognostic factors for the symptom control rate revealed that higher RT dose (BED ≥ 40 Gy10, hazard ratio; 0.503, p = 0.0406) and CCRT (hazard ratio; 0.427, p = 0.0449) were favorable factors.Table 3 Univariate analysis of factors affecting symptom control rate in 95 casesFull size tableFigure 2Symptom control rates according to the biologically equivalent dose (BED) and concurrent chemotherapy during RT (CCRT). (a) BED more than 40 Gy10 was a statistically significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0089) on univariate analysis in all cases. CCRT was a marginally significant factor (p = 0.0644) on univariate analysis in all cases. (b) In patients with pain, higher BED and CCRT was associated with improved outcome with statistical significance. (c) In patients with bleeding, only higher BED was statistically significant factor.Full size imageAll patients tolerated the palliative treatment. Thirty-eight patients experienced nausea, diarrhea, cystitis, or perineal skin reaction of grade 1 or 2 during treatment. There was no significant difference of treatment related toxicity between RT alone and CCRT (45% vs. 52%, p = 0.4380). There was no severe toxicity above grade 3 or treatment-related deaths.","External RT has been considered an effective palliative treatment in patients with an unresectable pelvic mass of colorectal cancer. Studies reported in the 1960s-1980s showed that relief of pain and/or bleeding was achieved in approximately 75% of patients with doses as low as 20 Gy in ten fractions over two weeks or various doses of 40-60Gy in 1.8-2.5 Gy per fraction [11–20]. Median duration of symptom relief was only 6-9 months. Later reports showed similar or improved results of symptom palliation: control of pain in 78-93% of patients, control of bleeding in 68-100%, and control of mass in 35-88% [9, 21–23]. The rate and duration of symptom palliation in our study were similar to those of previous reports.Some data suggest a correlation between RT dose and the effect of palliation. Wong CS et al. [9] reported the response rate of pelvic symptoms according to RT dose. There was a trend suggesting increased response rates with increasing total RT dose. For pain improvement after RT, 48% of patients responded after a total dose of less than 20 Gy, 77% responded after a dose of 20-30 Gy, 79% after 30-45 Gy, and 89% after 45 Gy or more. For residual, inoperable, or recurrent lesions, Wang CC and Schulz MD [17] reported that the percentage of patients with controlled symptoms for six months or more increased with dose (12% with 21-30 Gy, 31% with 31-40 Gy, and 58% with 41-50 Gy). Crane CH et al. [22] used hypofractionated RT with three different dose regimens (30 Gy/6 fractions, 35 Gy/14 fractions and 45 Gy/25 fractions). On univariate analysis, BED < 35 Gy10 showed a higher risk of pelvic symptomatic progression when α/β was assumed to be 10 Gy(p = 0.009). In our study, the overall symptom control rate and the one-year symptom control rate were 69% and 40.5% respectively for BED ≥ 40 Gy10 and 32% and 28.5% for BED < 40 Gy10. Since BED was a significant prognostic factor for symptom control rate, it might be better to treat with a higher RT dose to increase the palliation rate and symptom control duration.In the pelvic cavity, the tolerance dose of normal tissue is a limiting factor when determining the RT dose. The small bowel, which is regarded as one of the most sensitive organs to RT, has a tolerance dose of TD 5/5 with a dose of 50 Gy for 1/3 small bowel irradiation and TD 50/5 with a dose of 60 Gy [33]. The risk of injury to the bowel is increased in cases with a history of previous surgery. However, there is evidence suggesting that significant recovery of the RT effect occurs with time [23, 34]. Nieder C et al. [34] reported that acute responding tissues recovered from radiation injury within a few months and could then tolerate another full course of radiation. For late toxicity endpoints, the skin, mucosa, lung, and spinal cord do partially recover from subclinical injury at a magnitude dependent on the organ type, size of the initial dose, and, to a lesser extent, the interval between radiation courses. Mohiuddin M et al. [23] reported long term results of re-RT for patients with recurrent rectal cancer. They suggested a re-RT dose according to the interval between previous RT and re-RT as follows: 35 Gy for an interval of 3-12 months, 40-45 Gy for 12-24 months, 45-50 Gy for 24-36 months, and 50-55 Gy for more than 36 months. In our study, 27% of patients received re-RT, and there was no severe toxicity, including RT-induced fistula.There are a few studies on CCRT for palliative intent in patients with distant metastasis. Wong CS et al. [9] reviewed 519 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer treated with RT. Concurrent extrapelvic distant metastases were found in 164 patients. Twenty-two patients received CCRT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in a pilot study of combined modality therapy. Ten of the 22 patients were unable to complete the treatment protocol because of excessive acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity, and five patients developed neutropenic sepsis, one of whom died [35]. Crane CH et al. [22] first described the use of CCRT as an initial measure in 80 patients with synchronous distant metastasis from rectal cancer. Symptoms from the primary tumor resolved in 94% of cases, and progression occurred at a median of 33 weeks. There were acute complications of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Grade 3 or greater in four patients, severe perioperative complications in five patients, and no significant late treatment-related complications. They concluded that initial pelvic CCRT produced high pelvic symptom control rates and that patients can be safely treated using this modality. In a study of the clinical benefit of palliative CCRT in advanced gastric cancer, 37 patients were treated with palliative RT (median dose 35 Gy) and nearly two-thirds of all patients received CCRT [26]. The overall symptom control rate was approximately 70%, which was superior to the previous 25-54% control rate for palliative RT alone [36]. Some studies reported the benefit of palliative CCRT for dysphagia in advanced esophageal cancer [27–30]. A phase I/II trial from Canada [29] prospectively treated 22 patients with dysphagia from advanced incurable esophageal cancer with palliative RT (30 Gy/10 Fractions) and a concurrent single course of chemotherapy (5-FU and mitomycin-C). Treatment was generally well tolerated and 68% achieved a complete response. The median dysphagia-free interval from time of onset of improvement was 11 weeks, and 11 patients (73%) remained dysphagia-free until death. They concluded that a short course of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy might produce complete relief of swallowing difficulties in a substantial proportion of patients with acceptable toxicity. In our study, the overall symptom control rate and one-year symptom control rate were 64% and 61.3%, respectively, in CCRT and 52% and 33.2% in RT alone. There were no severe complications in the CCRT group.Our study has some limitations. First, this study was retrospectively analysis. It had heterogeneous patient's group and radiation dose. The results may be affected by the selection biases. Second, this study was performed in a small sample size. To conclude the effectiveness of the higher BED≥ 40 Gy10 and CCRT to symptomatic pelvic recurrence, prospective randomized trial might be needed."
