0,Analysis of adverse events and quality of life data for an economic evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer: when can we stop collecting?,"The SCOT colorectal cancer trial is a phase III randomised controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy of 12 weeks of chemotherapy versus 24 weeks and the associated toxicity, along with a lifetime economic analysis. The economic analysis will use prospective trial data to inform a lifetime cost-effectiveness model.Quality of life and toxicity data are only collected in a proportion of patients as the sample size required for these comparisons is much smaller than that required to show a significant difference in efficacy. This paper reports on an analysis of adverse events (AEs) and quality of life data, undertaken to determine whether it was appropriate to stop collecting quality of life data from new recruits. Do we have a large enough sample to detect whether the AEs and severity of AEs impact on quality of life?","Statistical analysis of data from the SCOT trial of patients with fully resected stage III colorectal cancer or fully resected high-risk stage II disease. Data collection commenced June 2008. EQ-5D and AE data was recorded at baseline, each treatment cycle and at follow-up intervals until December 2010. This interim dataset was analysed in STATA, using univariate and multivariate regression.","Univariate analysis showed that the majority of AEs significantly reduce quality of life (significant at 3% or less); however, multivariate analysis was inconclusive as AEs were highly correlated with one another. Uni- and multivariate regressions were re-run using indicator variables for AE grade groups for each specific adverse event type, and showed a highly significant (1% level) negative impact on quality of life as severity of grade increased, particularly for the adverse events Diarrhoea (-0.04 grade 1/2, -0.09 grade 3/4), Fatigue (-0.02 grade 1/2), Nausea (-0.05 grade 1/2, -0.14 grade 3/4), Neuropathy sensory (-0.02 grade 1/2, -0.19 grade 3/4), and Vomiting (-0.05 grade 1/2). Quality of life had a significant negative relationship with severity of AE grade, regardless of the specific event (0.017 grade 1, -0.058 grade 2, -0.062 grade 3, -0.145 grade 4).","Adverse events impact negatively on quality of life; however, multivariate regression was inconclusive due to multicolinearity between the adverse events. There was strong evidence to show that the AEs and AE grades significantly reduced quality of life using univariate analysis and therefore we can be confident that the sample from June 2008-Dec 2010 is sufficient and can stop collecting such data from new recruits."
1,Economic evaluation of monoclonal antibody in the management of colorectal cancer in Malaysia,The introduction of monoclonal antibody in the management of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) in the rapidly rising healthcare cost environment prompt a proper evaluation of its cost effectiveness especially to the local setting. The rising incidence of CRC in Malaysia also justifies a detailed evaluation on its economic impact. This study aims to determine the cost of CRC management and to compare the cost effectiveness of monoclonal antibody with conventional chemotherapy in the management of CRC.,"This economic evaluation study was performed from the societal perspective. It involves collecting resource utilization data based on clinical pathway of colorectal cancer management. Cost calculated included cost of drugs, human resources, administrative, investigations as well as capital cost. Direct and indirect patient’s cost were also calculated based on interview with CRC patients. CRC patients’ quality of life were measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and effectiveness estimates for monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab and Bevacizumab) treatment were modeled from study respondents based on references from other studies. One way sensitivity analysis was used to determine the robustness of the result.","A total of 160 respondents were involved in the study with the mean age of 58.47 (SD 12.04) years. The average cost of treating a case of colorectal cancer is RM 22,833.44 (RM 18,818.53 - RM 26,848.35). Cost of CRC management increased with increasing stage of the disease (Kruskal Wallis, X2 = 106, p < 0.001). Incremental cost per life years gained is RM 118,366.37 for Cetuximab and RM 61,584.68 for Bevacizumab. Incremental cost per quality adjusted life years gained for Cetuximab is RM 67,063.83 and RM 34,892.47 for Bevacizumab. Although both types of monoclonal antibody are considered cost effective (based on WHO guideline of less than 3 times of GDP), Bevacizumab is considered more cost effective than Cetuximab. Sensitivity analysis shows that, cost effectiveness was sensitive to the percentage of late stage of CRC.",Monoclonal antibody especially Bevacizumab is more cost effective in the management of late stage of CRC. Therefore it should be considered to be used in the CRC as a combination with the current chemotherapy treatment for CRC. The country should invest to the administration of monoclonal antibody to CRC treatment.
2,Magnification endoscopy to detect dysplastic aberrant crypt foci in Mexican patients with high risk for colorectal cancer,"The sequence of adenoma-cancer has been broadly documented, being accepted as the aberrant crypt-adenoma-cancer concept. These lesions are detected early in colonic carcinogenesis, but only a minority presents dysplasia.The objectives of the study are:1) to identify and measure FAC in patients with different levels of risk to develop colorectal cancer;2) to correlate FAC with magnification endoscopy and histopathological study, and 3) to correlate FAC histopathologically confirmed with over-expression of Ki-67 and p53.",We made a cases-controlled study at the endoscopy service of the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia-Mexico from March to June 2006. We selected patients with different indications for colonoscopy according to the potential risk for colorectal cancer. We made chromoendoscopy with magnification in the last 10 cm of the rectum and we took biopsies on the FAC sites; the samples were analyzed for a blind-test pathologist and we realized immunohistochemistry for p53 and Ki-67.,"We selected 24 patients, 10 male, 14 female, which were separated in groups according to the risk:Group 1: n = 8, mean age 52.3 years-old, ED 15.61. The most common indications for colonoscopy were chronic diarrhea, anemic syndrome digestive tract bleeding. The mean FAC were 2.5(0–8), in all cases corresponding to Kudo's types III

.Group 2: n = 16, mean age 45.3 y-o, SD 16.91. Of them 7/16 had CRC at the moment of the study, 7/16 just operated for CRC and 2/16 with familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The mean FAC were 6.25(0–22) that shows a statistical difference p < 0.001 with the mild risk group. In all cases corresponded to Kudo's patterns III
L
and III
s
. The sensitivity and specificity of chromoscopy with magnification to detect FAC were 83% and 56%, respectivly (p =< 0.00021), predictive positive value 31, predictive negative value 98. The observed concordance for presence or absence of FAC was 64%. The frequency of FCA-D for group 1 was 1.35%, group 2 18% (p < 0.00021). With respect to sporadic CRC and FAP-related CRC were 11.7% and 6.3%. The high risk patients with FAC had an odds-ratio (OR) 4.91, CI 95% (2.53, 9.74) (p =< 0.000000016). On group 2 with FCA-D the OR 8.58, CI 95% {2.82, 36.2} (p =< 0.000051). The over-expression of p53 was detected in only 6% of patients with FAC-D and high risk (p = 0.58).Ki-67 was positive in 100% of FAC-D, FAC-H and FAC NH-ND).","The frequency and intensity of FAC are higher in high risk population for CRC. The presences of FAC-D increase the risk 8-times more than in medium population. Chromoscopy with magnification has a low specificity and high sensitivity to detect FAC. The Ki-67 over-expression in FAC is present in almost all the cases, disregard to p53 which is over-expressed in a minority of FAC-D, which means deorganized hyperproliferation and that probably p53 is not present on FAC of sporadic CRC patients."
3,Mismatch repair genes status in sporadic Saudi colorectal cancer patients,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is becoming a major public health problem globally [1]. It ranks first in men and third in women of Saudi population according to Saudi Cancer Registry 2009 [2]. Many efforts have been directed toward assessment of best strategies for establishing molecular prognostic model [3, 4]. In our study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes defects in CRC and evaluate the concordance rate between Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC).","Two techniques were used: IHC using antibodies for MLH1 and MSH2 gene proteins and MSI tests using a panel of five Microsatellites' markers (BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250) that have been validated and recommended for tumor characterization as MS-stable, MSI-H or MSI-L. DNA samples from tumors and normal tissues of 83 patients undergoing curative surgery of sporadic CRC were amplified using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products were run on ABI prism 310 sequencer and GeneScan; version 310 software was used for analysis. Paraffinized tissue sections slides from the same patients tissues were used for IHC detection of MLH1 and MSH2 proteins.","The prevalence of MSI-H, MSI-L and MS-stable were 44.6 %, 31.3 % and 24.1 % respectively. IHC identified 50 cases (60.2%) with loss of expression of MLH1 and 40 cases (48.2%) with loss of expression of MSH2. Concordance rate between MSI and IHC is 55.4%. Furthermore, 28.9% of no concordance is attributed to other MMR genes not included in our study.",MSI and IHC are complementary useful techniques for evaluation of MMR status. Further study with a large cohort is needed to evaluate correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and to be used as prognostics.This work was financially supported by King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) under research no (ARP -30-262).
4,Role of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of sporadic colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Majority of the cases (~92%) are sporadic (nonhereditary), while the hereditary types constitute a lower percentage. The pathogenesis of sporadic CRC is heterogeneous and multi-factorial. In addition to environmental exposure, diet and lifestyle; accumulation of random somatic mutations also significantly affects the transcription of the genome and contributes to the carcinogenesis process. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have evolved as a unique class of endogenous regulators that offer great potential in the elucidation of cancer pathophysiology. The primary aim is to study the role of miRNAs as early biomarkers in sporadic CRC aetiology and pathogenesis.","Matched-pairs of 30 cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, 47 blood samples from sporadic CRC patients and 30 blood samples from healthy controls have been collected from the University of Malaya Medical Centre. Total RNA was extracted and profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 2.0 microarray chips. The microarray results and predicted targets have also been analyzed using miRNA bioinformatic softwares.","A panel of significantly dysregulated miRNAs were identified (p < 0.05), namely miR-106a, -20a, -21, -223, -24 and -424. Based on TargetScan software, these miRNAs were found to participate in the regulation of keysignaling pathways in the adenoma-carcinoma sequences in CRC. Several predicted target genes involved were APC, KRAS, PI3K, SMAD and MMPs. These genes have been described to play crucial roles in inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",miRNAs are informative in shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of sporadic CRC and circulating blood miRNAs are reflective of those in tissues. Further studies into the blood miRNA profiles would elucidate their potential roles as novel noninvasive biomarkers in CRC.
5,Cost analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) management in UKM Medical Centre using clinical pathway,"Cost analysis has become a huge concern in today’s healthcare due to the rising healthcare cost and the pressure for policy makers to make appropriate resource allocations. One of the approaches to cost calculation is by activity based costing using clinical pathway. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is fast becoming a threat to an industrialising country like Malaysia due to its rapidly rising incidence trend. Therefore, this study aims to develop a clinical pathway in managing CRC in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) and to determine the cost of managing CRC according to disease stages.","Expert panel discussion involving surgeons, an oncologist, a radiologist and a public health specialist was done to develop a clinical pathway and subsequently a clinical algorithm. Cost analysis was performed using activity-based costing approach. Estimation of the capital cost was made using Clinical Cost-Modelling (CCM) software version 2.0 by UKMMC. The final cost of CRC management for a year was calculated based on providers’ perspective.","The clinical pathway developed based on stages of CRC. Management of CRC was established to be more complex as the stage of the disease becomes more severe. The mean cost of treating a case of CRC in UKMMC for a year is RM20,831.36 and it ranges from RM17,624.77-RM24,225.15. The cost of managing stage I is RM12,961.00 and it increase to RM26,455.29 for stage IV . There is a significant difference in the mean cost of CRC management between stages of CRC (Kruskal Wallis,p < 0.001). Activity based costing contributes more than half of the total cost for each stage of CRC as compared to capital cost.",Cost of CRC management increase with the increasing stage of the disease. Nationwide screening programme should be implemented in order to detect early cases of CRC and subsequently save the cost of CRC management.
6,"Effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis in high risk patients (ASA III and IV) with colorectal cancer on perioperative cytokine levels, complications and global quality of life",The effects of a prophylaxis with G-CSF on postoperative outcome was examined in high risk patients with colorectal carcinoma. In a pilot study we examined whether changes in cytokine levels and leukocyte count correlate with the onset of complications and influence global quality of life.,"Patients (ASA class III and IV) with colorectal cancer were randomized in a double-blinded pilot study to: prophylaxis with G-CSF (12 hours before surgery, 12 and 36 hours after surgery) versus placebo. Measurements of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-18, Procalcitonin (PCT) in plasma, leukocyte count, percentage of polynuclear granulocytes (PMNs) and their phagocytic activity were started before operation and continued till day 6 after surgery. TNF-a release was determined after LPS in vitro stimulation of whole blood. All complications were documented as well as quality of life (QL) at discharge, 2 and 6 months after surgery using the EORTC QLQ 30 questionnaire and for global QL the index-points of the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated.","In one patient of the placebo group surgery was cancelled after randomization (withdrawal). In all measurements IL-6 and IL-18 levels and the leukocyte count of the G-CSF group were above placebo and normal values. Only in the placebo group phagocytic activity of granulocytes fell below normal values. There was no difference between the groups regarding IL-8, PCT and TNF-a release. All values were within normal range besides PCT. PCT values were elevated on day 1 after operation on average up to 1.9 and at day 3 on 1.2 ng/ml (normal <0.5 ng/ml). Patient 2 developed fever on day 5 after surgery and leukocytosis on the basis of an anastomotic leakage. Patient 4 had the highest IL-6 levels of all patients on day 6 and on day 8 a duodenal ulcer perforation. Patient 5 developed a bowel atony on day 5 and showed the highest IL-18 levels of all patients on day 6.","The development of postoperative early phase complications is accompanied by changes of cytokine- and bloodcell patterns. Prophylactic treatment with G-CSF elevated IL-6 and IL-18 levels and improved phagocytic activity of granulocytes. The expected influence on global quality of life could not be demonstrated in the pilot study. The correlations found are being further examined in an ongoing randomized, double-blinded trial with 80 patients.TableFull size table"
