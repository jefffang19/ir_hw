0,RNA-Seq profiling of circular RNAs in human colorectal Cancer liver metastasis and the potential biomarkers,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an important member of the non-coding RNA family following microRNAs and lncRNAs. They are characterized by the absence of covalently closed loop structures at the 3′ and 5′ ends. Base on this closed structure, circRNAs are highly stable and not easily degraded [1]. As this mechanism of circRNA as a ceRNA is revealed, this is considered to be an important way for circRNA to play a role in disease progression. CircRNA can act as a sponge to adsorb miRNA, and then regulate the expression of miRNA and its target genes [2, 3]. In addition, circRNAs have a certain specificity in different tissues and are therefore suitable as biomarkers for cancers. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs are abnormally expressed in tumor tissues, and some circRNAs as the potential biomarkers have been discovered [4,5,6]. However, as far as we know, there is no study on the role of circRNAs in liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. In this study, we used the secondary sequencing technology to compare the expression profile of circRNAs in the tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients and colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis. Then, we expand the sample size to verify some candidates and assess the diagnostic value of the circRNAs as the biomarkers for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Finally, we constructed a network map based on two circRNAs and their respective potential binding miRNA-mRNAs to better investigate their potential mechanisms of action in colorectal cancer liver metastasis.","A total of 40 patients were involved in this study, including 24 colorectal cancer patients (CRC) and another 16 colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases (CRC-m). Tumor tissue samples of these patients obtained from the surgical treatment at the Department of General Surgery, Longhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China. The samples were snap froze in liquid nitrogen after separated from the human body immediately and stored at − 80 °C before using. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Longhua Hospital, and the informed consent form was signed by every participant.","The total RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity and DNA contamination were assessed using electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel. Before constructing the RNA-seq libraries, the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina,San Diego, CA, USA) and the CircRNA Enrichment Kit (Cloud-seq,USA) were used to remove the rRNA and enrich the circRNAs. The RNA-seq libraries were constructed by using pretreated RNAs with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were denatured as single-stranded DNA molecules, captured on Illumina flow cells, amplified in situ as clusters and finally sequenced for 150 cycles on Illumina HiSeq™ 4000 Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)according to the manufacturer’s instructions.","Paired-end reads were harvested from Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer, and were quality controlled by Q30. The reads were aligned to the reference genome/transcriptome with STAR software and circRNAs were detected and annotated with DCC software. CircBase database and circ2Trait disease database were used to annotated the identified circRNAs. Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified by T test between two groups."
