0,Genetic basis of common human disease: insight into the role of nonsynonymous SNPs from genome-wide association studies,"Recent genome-wide association studies have led to the reliable identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a number of loci associated with an increased risk of developing specific common human diseases. Each such locus implicates multiple possible candidate SNPs as being involved in the disease mechanism, and determining which SNPs actually contribute, and by what mechanism, is a major challenge. A variety of mechanisms may link the presence of a SNP to altered in vivo gene product function and hence contribute to disease risk. We have analyzed the role of one of these mechanisms, nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in proteins, for associations found in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) study of seven common diseases [1] and the follow-up work.","Using HapMap data and linkage disequilibrium information, we identified all possible candidate SNPs associated with increased disease risk. We then applied two computational methods [2, 3], based on analysis of protein structure and sequence, to determine which of these SNPs has a significant impact on in vivo protein function (SNPs3D) [4].","Several of these disease-associated loci were found to be linked to one or more high-impact nsSNPs. In some cases, these SNPs are in well-known proteins (such as human leukocyte antigens). In other cases, they are in less well-established disease-associated genes (for example, MST1 for Crohn’s disease), and in yet others, they are in proteins that have been poorly investigated (for example, gasdermin B, also for Crohn’s disease). Approximately 55% of these disease-associated loci have at least one nsSNP, and about 33% of them have at least one high-impact nsSNP in those regions.","Together, these data suggest a significant role for nsSNPs in common human disease susceptibility."
1,Joint analysis of genome-wide genetic variants associated with gene expression and disease susceptibility,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human complex disease have identified a large number of disease-associated genetic loci, which are distinguished by distinctive frequencies of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals with a particular disease. However, these data do not provide direct information on the biological basis of a disease or on the underlying mechanisms. Many studies have shown that variations in gene expression among individuals, as well as among cell types, contribute to phenotype diversity and disease susceptibility. Recent genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association (GWEA) studies have provided information on genetic factors, especially SNPs, that are associated with gene expression variation. These expression-associated SNPs (exSNPs) have already been utilized to explain some results of GWAS for diseases, but interpretation of the data is handicapped by low reproducibility of the genotype-expression relationships.","To address this problem, we established several gold standard sets of high-reliability exSNPs based on multiple occurrences in different GWEA studies in various human populations and cell types. We then related these data to results from GWAS for diseases, to find a set of disease-associated loci that are likely to have an underlying expression mechanism. HapMap linkage disequilibrium data were utilized to allow the comparison of GWEA results from studies that employed different microarray SNP sets.","We integrated the current gold standard data with SNPs in disease-associated loci from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS of seven common human diseases. Approximately one-third of these disease-associated loci in the WTCCC GWAS were found to be consistent with an underlying expression change mechanism. Comparing separate gold standard sets for Caucasian (CEU), African (YRI) and Asian (ASN) populations also allowed us to investigate which exSNPs contribute to population-specific eQTLs.",Use of the gold standard set of SNP-expression relationships has enabled us to more reliably determine the role of expression changes in common human diseases.
2,Short communication: genetic variations of SLC2A9 in relation to Parkinson’s disease,"Details of the study method were published previously [7]. Briefly, we first identified self-reported PD cases from a large population-based cohort – the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. We then asked the treating physicians to fill out a short diagnostic questionnaire and to send a copy of relevant medical records. The diagnoses were either confirmed by their treating neurologists or via medical record review by a movement disorder specialist (XH). Only confirmed PD patients were included in the present analyses. Controls were randomly selected from participants of the same cohort who did not report a PD diagnosis and they were frequency matched to cases by sex, ethnicity, and year of birth. Therefore, both cases and controls were from the same base population and no additional exclusion criteria were applied. Both cases and controls provided saliva samples from which DNAs were extracted. Twelve SNPs were selected from SLC2A9 based on recent GWAS findings on plasma urate [5, 6]. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina BeadXpress platform with a call rate of 99.9%. All participants provided written consent and the study protocol was approved by relevant institutional review boards. To avoid population stratification, the current analysis was limited to 788 cases and 911 controls who self-reported as non-Hispanic Whites.Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls was confirmed with chi-square statistics for all SNPs (P > 0.05). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from logistic regression models under the assumption of logit-additive allelic effects, adjusting for age, sex, smoking status and caffeine intake. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and two sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed power calculations with Quanto version 1.2.4.","Table 1 showed population characteristics of PD patients and controls. Cases and controls were matched by birth year in five year groups and gender. For cases, the average age of PD diagnosis was 66.6 ± 7.4 years and the average age of PD onset was 65.7 ± 7.4 years. As expected, cases were less likely to smoke and had lower caffeine intake than controls.Table 1 
                        Population characteristics of cases and controls*
Full size tableThe 12 SNPs from SLC2A9 were all in linkage disequilibrium (R2 > 0.7). In general, none of these SNPs were associated with PD in overall and gender specific analyses (Table 2). Among women, there was a suggestion that the presence of the minor allele of one SLC2A9 SNP (rs7442295) was related to a small increase in PD risk (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 1.01-2.16). The direction of this relation is consistent with that would be predicted based on the relationship of this SNP to plasma urate. The association was however not statistical significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.Table 2 
                        Selected
SLC2A9
SNPs in relation to the risk of Parkinson’s disease*
Full size table","PD has an insidious onset and a long latency period, therefore epidemiological findings are often subject to competing explanations of biology versus reverse causality that the exposures are secondary to the underlying disease process. Although the exact biological mech-anisms are yet to be revealed, higher plasma urate has been linked to lower PD risk in several prospective studies [1, 2]. Plasma urate increases with age in human and has been hypothesized to protect dopaminergic neurons via its potent antioxidant properties. On the other hand, one cannot exclude the possibility that plasma urate rises in response to increased free radicals as a result of PD pathogenesis.Genetic analyses may help to clarify such epidemiologic findings. Unlikely diet, lifestyle or many other environmental exposures, genetic variants are fixed and not affected by disease process. They are randomly assorted during gamete formation in a process that is similar to randomization in clinical trials. “Mendelian randomization” has thus been proposed to investigate causality of epidemiologic findings by circumventing reverse causation and confounding [4]. If a non-genetic exposure is causally related to an outcome, robust genetic determinants of this exposure are expected to relate to the outcome. Previous Mendelian randomization analyses using large samples support a causative relationship of plasma urate with gout, but argue against one with cardiovascular diseases [8, 9].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to follow up recent GWAS finding on SLC2A9 and plasma urate for PD research, and some of these SNPs were included in the above-mentioned studies on gout and cardiovascular diseases [8, 9]. SLC2A9 was the first urate transporter gene that was identified from GWAS and has shown the most robust association with plasma urate and gout in previous studies [8, 9]. Reduced renal excretion of urate is the most important cause of high plasma urate and gout, and SLC2A9 encodes a major urate transporter [10]. Although the exact causal variants of the SLC2A9 gene that determine plasma urate are yet to be identified, GWAS studies have linked several tag SNPs in this gene to the level of plasma urate. However, in GWAS, these SNPs only explain a small amount of plasma urate concentration [5] and thus the expected OR for PD associated with these SNPs are smaller than 1.1 for both men and women. Although our study is among the largest population-based studies on PD with both genetic and environmental data, the power of our study to detect such weak associations was limited. With 788 cases and 911 controls, we estimated that we had 80% power to identify an OR of higher than 1.25 or lower than 0.79 for a minor allele frequency of 25%. Other limitations of the current study include the lack of plasma urate, and that we did not include genetic variations from other key genes that are related to plasma urate as identified in later GWAS studies [11].In summary, our analysis did not support a relationship between these SLC2A9 SNPs and PD in men, but it does not exclude a modest association for women.",None reported.
3,Detecting disease rare alleles using single SNPs in families and haplotyping in unrelated subjects from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data,"Based on evolutionary history, it is expected that human genomes will be arranged into local regions with high haplotype similarity intermingled with local regions with haplotype diversity. In the diverse haplotype regions, rare alleles may play an important role in creating the foundation for individual subjects’ susceptibility or resistance to a particular disease. It is a common practice in genetic research to identify causative disease regions in the framework of association using single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tests or by grouping neighboring regions under identifiable haplotypes and to test their association with disease and quantitative traits. Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17) provides 200 replicates of simulated data of a family-based cohort with eight large families and 200 replicates of simulated data for unrelated individuals. This simulated problem is challenging, because both sets of data are relatively small (n = 697). We investigate the two problems independently to determine whether the family-based association tests have power to detect rare allele effects and whether rare allele effects in the simulated genes can also be detected by haplotype analysis of the unrelated individuals sample.","The GAW17 data represent 200 replicates of simulated phenotypes for a sample of 697 subjects organized in 8 large families (referred in this article as the familial sample) and 200 replicates of simulated phenotypes for a separate sample of data of 697 unrelated individuals (referred to here as the unrelated sample). Genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project were used as the genotype sample for the unrelated sample. The GAW17 simulation authors [1] used the family data set, by means of the program CHRSIM [2], to drop the phased founder genotypes throughout the rest of the pedigree by considering a single obligate crossover event occurring on each chromosome. The same two genotype sets were used for all 200 phenotypic simulation replicates for the familial or unrelated sample.We analyzed the unrelated sample genotypes for linkage disequilibrium using HaploView software (version 4.2), with the purpose of identifying tag SNPs [3]. The options we used in a batch mode run of HaploView for identifying tag SNPs were –pairwiseTagging and –tagrsqcutoff 0.8. We used the number of discovered tag SNPs as a denominator for extrapolating the Bonferroni genome-wide significance threshold for a single-SNP association test (see Results section).After setting a genome-wide significance threshold, we applied a linear mixed effects (LME) model to the familial sample. The LME statistical analyses are based on linear estimates of additive genetic effects of single SNPs. The LME model is:
                    (1)
                where β1g measures the change in Y as a result of the additive change in the genotype g∈(−1, 0, +1) where −1 is the code for the homozygote genotype for the minor allele, 0 is the code for the heterozygote, and +1 is the code for the homozygote for the major allele. We implemented association tests using a statistical mixed model on the familial sample via the mixed procedure (PROC MIXED) of SAS (version 9.2, Linux OS). The “repeated” statement was used with sub=pedid, which defines the structure of the R matrix, and the covariance structure was selected as UN. We tested all 24,487 SNPs included in the simulation, although we had prior knowledge of the GAW17 simulation answers. With such prior knowledge we focused on trait Q2.Q2 was simulated as a quantitative trait, influenced primarily by 72 SNPs in 13 genes, with 1–15 functional variants per gene and with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) ranging from 0.07% to 17.07%. The residual heritability of Q2 was simulated to be 29%. Most of the genes affecting the Q2 trait were selected to be related to cardiovascular disease risk and inflammation, and they are located on chromosomes 2, 3, 6–12, and 17. Before the LME association tests, we performed a stepwise regression for Q2 within Sex to remove the effects of Age and Age2. As a result, we produced a Q2 residual, which we then used as the dependent variable Y in our analyses. In the statistical analyses, the variable Sex was included as a covariate (β2cov).We applied haplotype association tests only in the unrelated individuals sample and specifically within causative simulated genes. We viewed the haplotype analysis as a replication analysis by completing it in the unrelated sample for only trait Q2 simulated causative genes. This was justified by the preceding gain of information from the LME analysis and from the knowledge we had of the simulated model for Q2. We implemented the haplotype analyses using Haplo.Stats, version 1.4.4 [4]. The haplotypes studied were created by sliding windows of two and windows of three adjacent SNPs. This program was run in a batch mode in R software, version 2.10.0, for Linux OS. The Haplo.Stats package includes an EM algorithm to estimate haplotype frequencies for unrelated subjects. In the haplo.score function (within this package), Schaid et al. [4] implemented the score statistics U
β
 and V
β
, where:
                    (2)
                is a measure of covariation of residuals with the recoded genotypes and:
                    (3)
                is the variance. To test the association of the trait and marker haplotypes, Schaid et al. [4] also provided a global score statistic S,
                    (4)
                with a chi-square distribution and degrees of freedom equal to the rank of V
β
.Finally, we use two definitions to summarize the LME results: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the proportion of true-positive causative SNPs that have a significant test result in 200 replications; and specificity is the proportion of true-negative SNPs that have a negative test result in 200 replications. Both sensitivity and specificity are expressed as percentages.","The HaploView linkage disequilibrium analysis on all 24,487 markers in the unrelated sample identified 11,626 tag SNPs. Therefore our Bonferroni genome-wide significance (α = 0.05) threshold p-value for independent tests was 4.3 × 10−6 (−log10p = 5.4). Figure 1 shows the results of the average −log10p single-SNP genome-wide significance of 200 replications in families produced by fitting an additive genetic model on Q2 residuals. The average of −log10p for 200 replications was for all simulated SNPs under the 5.4 (−log10p) threshold. In particular, a group of SNPs simulated in genes VNN1 (C6S5380, MAF = 17.9%) on chromosome 6 and LPL (C8S442, MAF = 4.2%) showed to some extent significant results.Figure 1Genome-wide linear mixed effects additive model association test results of 200 replications of family-based cohort data on Q2 residuals. None of the SNPs’ −log10p mean values passed the 5.4 genome-wide threshold. Sens. = sensitivity. Red triangles mark chromosomes that were simulated with Q2 causative SNPs (72 of them in 13 genes).Full size imageFigure 2 shows the sensitivity per simulated gene by selecting the most significant representative SNP. For example, sensitivity was 37.5% for LPL (marker C8S442) and 34.5% for VNN1 (marker C6S5380). The specificity for noncausative genes of these tests was very high, >99% (Figure 2).Figure 2Sensitivity and specificity of SNPs discovery by using the linear mixed-effects additive model on gene bases for the Q2 simulated traitFull size imageWe performed association tests for all causative genes, with sliding windows of haplotypes taken two or three markers at a time, in the unrelated sample. Both types of sliding windows incorporated the detectable effects of the simulated data. For example, haplotype C8S441-C8S442-C8S443 with a frequency of 1.6% in the gene LPL was associated significantly with Q2 (Figure 3). Another haplotype that included marker C8S442 (C8S442-C8S443-C8S444) and had the same frequency of 1.6% also showed significant association with Q2. In genes VNN3 and VNN1 a few haplotypes (with two-marker windows) showed significant association with Q2, for example, haplotype C6S5448-C6S5449 with a frequency of 1% and haplotype C6S5379-C6S5380 with a frequency of 17.1% (Figure 4). When using the genome-wide significance threshold of −log10p of 5.4, sensitivity on genes VNN3 and VNN1 of the most significant haplotype (C6S5379-C6S5380) was 11.5%, and for LPL (haplotype C8S441-C8S442-C8443) the sensitivity was 2%. Otherwise, if we considered the haplotype analysis in the unrelated sample as a replication of the preliminary discovery in the familial sample and set the significance threshold to a value corresponding to the number of haplotype windows tests per gene, then the corresponding sensitivity became 22.9% for LPL and 64.5% for VNN3 and VNN1. Other haplotypes from other rare allele SNP simulated regions did not confirm significant results.Figure 3Three-marker sliding windows haplotypes for the LPL gene. Haplotypes containing the SNP C8S442, although close to rare haplotypes (frequency 1.6), showed distinct association with Q2 trait.Full size imageFigure 4Two-marker sliding windows haplotypes for genes VNN3 and VNN1. Haplotypes containing C6S5380 and C6S5449 show distinct association with Q2.Full size image","Detecting association of very rare alleles (MAF < 1%) with disease or quantitative traits in familial data of small sample size is challenging. One would have guessed that in the GAW17 data set, because of its simulation as a transmission of selected alleles from the unrelated sample into the familial sample, one or more rare alleles would have been transmitted as common alleles in the familial sample. In the simulated data such conversion from rare alleles into common ones with the existing small sample sizes (from unrelated founders into familial data) was not present. Therefore in both sets of genotypic data, simulations were performed mostly on the very rare alleles in 96% of the 72 selected SNPs for Q2. The average −log10p-value of genome-wide association tests on the simulated data was less than the significance threshold. This illustrates the necessity of finding other methods that manage association tests for rare alleles.With the massive data dumps coming from new sequencing technologies, rare alleles will be captured more often in the data and will be the aim of many studies. Moreover, it is believed that rare alleles are the gold dust that confer the rest of disease heritability. It is possible that, in contrast to this simulation, sample sizes in real data will become larger as the costs of sequencing decrease. But in the existing case we needed to find ways to increase our statistical power to identify the rare causative variants in association with disease or quantitative traits. Therefore we used a two-step analysis design: the LME model for discovering genome-wide causative SNPs or genes in the familial sample and haplotype association tests for replicating primary findings, but now in the unrelated sample.The haplotype association test has more power to identify the SNPs’ effect on disease and quantitative traits. The haplotype association tests produced significant results for several common haplotypes, including those with a frequency close to 1%. However, this method also failed to identify any other significant haplotypes in association with Q2 from the very rare simulated SNPs (MAF < 1%). Based on our results for 200 replications, we conclude that failing to detect the very rare causative SNPs was not a failure of the methods but more a reflection of the low statistical power available with the small sample size of the simulated data."

5,Genetic and biological characterizations of a Newcastle disease virus from swine in china,"NDV or avian paramyxovirus type I (APMV1) is one of the most serious infectious agents affecting poultry, and it can cause serious economic losses in poultry [1, 2]. In the past few years, NDV appeared frequently in China [3]. NDV has been considered to only infect avian species. However, one paramyxovirus isolate (Xiny10) was isolated from one sick swine whose clinical signs were characterized by progressive weight loss, fever and diarrhea in post-weaned pigs of approximately 9 weeks of age.In this paper, Xiny10 and 24 other NDV isolates from different hosts in 1970–2010 were characterized molecularly, which would help us understand the potential relationship between swine NDV and the other NDVs from different hosts.","Xiny10 was isolated from swine in Henan province of China in 2010. The sequences of field isolates and vaccine strains were downloaded from Genbank of NCBI, detailed in Table 1. The name rule for field isolates was Host. Location. Name. Year(Genbank No.). The cross-hemagglutination inhibition test, intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), mean death time (MDT) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) were conducted as described in the OIE manual [4]. Animal maintenance and experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences.Table 1 
                        Properties of NDV strains in the study
Full size tableXiny10 strain was isolated from swine’s liver by using 10-day-old SPF chicken embryonated eggs. The viral RNA was extracted from the cultures of embryo by using the MiniBEST viral RNA Extraction kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The one-step RT-PCR was performed with NDV-specific primers designed by the F gene [GenBank: AF077761]. F-F: 5′-atg ggc tcc aaa cct tct ac-3′, and F-R: 5′-ttg tag tgg ctc tca tc-3′, targeting 1662 bp. The thermal profile of RT-PCR was 50°C for 40 min and 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 90s, 52°C for 90s, 72°C for 90s, and a final extension cycle of 72°C for 10 min. The fragment was cloned and sequenced by Shanghai BGI company and subsequently submitted to NCBI [Genbank: JN032760]. Nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic tree were analyzed by the MegAlign program (DNAStar Inc. Madison) and MEGA4.0 (http://www.megasoftware.net).","Through serologic tests and sequence alignment, Xiny10 was proved as NDV. F protein cleavage site of NDV is an important determinant of NDV pathogenicity and virulence [5, 6]. The F protein cleavage site showed Xiny10 had a common motif 112 G-R-Q-G-R-L117 that was consistent with lentogenic vaccine virus La Sota. And the biological tests suggested that Xiny10 possessed separately the MDT of 102 h, the ICPI of 0.2, the IVPI of 0, which proved it was highly lentogenic. Interestingly, as reported experimentally [7], another swine NDV JL01 was an lentogenic strain with F protein cleavage site 112 G-K-Q-G-R-L117, but the biological virulence was velogenic.From the phylogenetic tree of the amino acid sequences [8, 9] (Figure 1), Xiny10 and vaccine strain La Sota belonged to genotype II, but JL01 and V4 belonged to genotype I. And La Sota and V4 are the most popular vaccines in China now. The comparison of amino acid sequences showed Xiny10 and JL01 shared 98.7%, 92.8% identities with La Sota; and the homology between the two isolates was only 91.7%. In summary, these data confirmed that Xiny10 strain had great differences with previously reported swine strain in virulence, genotype, and amino acid homology of F gene.Figure 1Phylogenetic tree of the amino acid sequences of 25 NDV strains based on F gene. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method with MEGA4.0.Full size imageAmong all genotype II NDVs, some isolates were derived from chicken, duck, goose and other poultry varieties, but there were also isolates from wild birds, such as: turkey (VGGA89), penguin (BJ99), parrot (CUL97). As one of them, Xiny10 shared 97.3%–98.7% identities with genotype II NDVs, which was higher than 91.9% for genotype I(Ulster67,V4), 90.6% for genotype III(AUS32), 91.9% for genotype IV(Herts33), 87.3% for genotype V(44083,211472), 87.3% for genotype VI(PB), 88.1%–89.2% for genotype VII(TW95,FP1), 90.1% for genotype VIII(TL70), 91.1%–91.3% for genotype IX(F48E9,FW07).","We confirmed the paramyxovirus isolate Xiny10 from swine was NDV. Furthermore, it was obtained from one area where swine and poultry mixed for breeding. Meanwhile, it had such a high amino acid homology with vaccine La Sota. In addition, Xiny10 and La Sota owned the same 12 conserved Cysteine residues and 6 potential glycosylation sites which maybe affect viral structure and antigenicity[10]. Additionally, Xiny10 revealed the higher amino acid homology with the field strains from different hosts of genotype II. These above data suggested that the swine virus might be generated from La Sota because it has been widely used as live virus vaccine until now in China."
6,Joint analysis of genome-wide genetic variants associated with gene expression and disease susceptibility,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human complex disease have identified a large number of disease-associated genetic loci, which are distinguished by distinctive frequencies of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals with a particular disease. However, these data do not provide direct information on the biological basis of a disease or on the underlying mechanisms. Many studies have shown that variations in gene expression among individuals, as well as among cell types, contribute to phenotype diversity and disease susceptibility. Recent genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association (GWEA) studies have provided information on genetic factors, especially SNPs, that are associated with gene expression variation. These expression-associated SNPs (exSNPs) have already been utilized to explain some results of GWAS for diseases, but interpretation of the data is handicapped by low reproducibility of the genotype-expression relationships.","To address this problem, we established several gold standard sets of high-reliability exSNPs based on multiple occurrences in different GWEA studies in various human populations and cell types. We then related these data to results from GWAS for diseases, to find a set of disease-associated loci that are likely to have an underlying expression mechanism. HapMap linkage disequilibrium data were utilized to allow the comparison of GWEA results from studies that employed different microarray SNP sets.","We integrated the current gold standard data with SNPs in disease-associated loci from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS of seven common human diseases. Approximately one-third of these disease-associated loci in the WTCCC GWAS were found to be consistent with an underlying expression change mechanism. Comparing separate gold standard sets for Caucasian (CEU), African (YRI) and Asian (ASN) populations also allowed us to investigate which exSNPs contribute to population-specific eQTLs.",Use of the gold standard set of SNP-expression relationships has enabled us to more reliably determine the role of expression changes in common human diseases.
7,A Bayesian network approach to study host and viral genetic correlates of HIV-1 disease progression,"HIV disease progression is very variable among infected patients. Using classical statistical methods based on a selected number of markers, Casado et al [1] identified a number of host and viral genetic correlates for the clinical definitions of HIV-1 disease progression: elite controllers, long term non progressors including viremic controllers and clinical non progressors, regular progressors and rapid progressors.","Host genetic and viral data for 64 patients as described by Casado et al were transformed to Boolean variables and used in a Bayesian Network (BN) learning approach, using the online version of the B-Course software (http://b-course.cs.helsinki.fi/obc/), scoring models by maximizing the posterior probability of the model. The predictive value of the network for classifying the clinical definitions, was investigated using exact Bayesian inference in the network The network arcs that were weighing most in the predictive power of the network were uncovered by evaluating for each arc how predictive the network still was when omitting this arc.","To visualize the various dependencies among clinical definitions, and host and viral factors, we used a Bayesian network representation of the data. A number of variables that were redundant (being part of the definition of the groups) or non-discriminative were left out for inferring the network: viral load, proviral load, predicted X4/R5 phenotype and nature and charge, ethnicity and age. The network correctly captured many known correlations in the data, for example, patterns of linkage disequilibrium among genetic markers (i.e., HLA-A and ZNRD1, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles, CCR5 haplotypes), and provided numerical support to the various dependencies. Clinical definitions (class) were directly dependent on viral evolution expressed as ""viral dating"", protective HLA-B alleles, and HLA-C genotypes. One variable, CCR2 V64l rs1799864, was not retained in the network. The results were consistent with what Casado et al described in their paper.","We applied a Bayesian approach to the joint analysis of the diverse host and viral data. The resulting network provided a comprehensive and hierarchical structure of the various dependencies; it identified viral evolution and HLA-B and HLA-C alleles as key correlates of clinical definitions of disease progression, confirming the results obtained by classical statistics. We feel that the Bayesian approach is well suited to quickly explore large datasets, saving time by prioritizing subsequent statistical confirmation of the associations found. Such Bayesian networks could also be applied for predicting the clinical course of the individual."
