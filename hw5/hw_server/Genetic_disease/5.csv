0,Singling out genetic disorders and disease,"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an alternative to prenatal diagnosis involving the biopsy and genetic testing of single cells from in vitro obtained oocytes and/or preimplantation embryos. Only embryos shown to be free of the genetic defect under study are transferred to the uterus of the patient. PGD is performed for couples at high risk of transmitting a genetic condition to their children; it offers the advantage of circumventing an invasive prenatal diagnosis and therapeutic abortion.Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) involves the selection of euploid embryos to improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) results and to avoid pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities [1]. Considering the increasing risk for aneuploidy with advanced maternal age and findings of high aneuploidy rates in spontaneous abortions, PGS has been offered to specific IVF patient groups: patients of advanced maternal age and patients with recurrent IVF failure or repeated miscarriages (not due to translocations). For many years, PGS using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 5 to 12 chromosomes has been applied worldwide but without real validation of its efficiency. In recent years, several randomized controlled trials have failed to show a benefit for PGS, as summarized in the meta-analysis by Checa and colleagues [2]. Biological (embryonic mosaicism) and technical (limitations of FISH and negative impact of cleavage-stage biopsy) arguments were proposed to explain the lack of benefit. Further clinical practice now awaits new randomized controlled trials to prove that PGS with biopsy at other stages, and using new array methods with full chromosome analysis, improves live birth rates and reduces miscarriage rates [3]. PGD and PGS rely on the same technology, but since PGS is offered to (sub)fertile couples without genetic diseases, it is mostly outside the scope of this review.PGD developed in the wake of human IVF and PCR technology. The first children born after PGD were reported by Handyside et al. in 1990 [4]. In these initial cycles, PCR was used for gender determination in families with X-linked diseases. Later, FISH became the standard method for sexing, and also for chromosomal aberrations, while PCR-based methods were used for the detection of single gene defects. It is essential that these techniques are adapted to the single-cell level and are thoroughly validated before clinical application.PGD requires a multidisciplinary team with a close collaboration and excellent communication between the assisted reproduction unit and the medical genetics unit. Preferentially, both units work within the same institute. Alternatively, transport PGD can be set up, and IVF treatment (hormonal stimulation, oocyte retrieval and in vitro fertilization, embryo culture and embryo transfer) is carried out at a satellite assisted-reproduction unit. Only the biopsied embryonic cell samples are transported, often over long distances, to a genetics unit specializing in single-cell diagnosis.Extensive data on PGD cycles, pregnancies, deliveries and children have been collected by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) PGD consortium since 1997 and, although not worldwide, the data sets offer comprehensive insights into this particular field of single-cell testing [5].","The main indications for PGD are chromosomal abnormalities, X-linked disorders and single gene or monogenic disorders. The majority of PGD cycles for chromosomal abnormalities are aimed at reciprocal and Robertsonian translocations, while cases with inversions or insertions are less frequent. For the monogenic disorders, PGD was initially applied for the same indications as in prenatal diagnosis. According to the latest ESHRE PGD consortium data, the most common indications for autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy and hemoglobinopathies [6]. For the autosomal dominant disorders, myotonic dystrophy type 1, neurofibromatosis and Huntington's disease are the most frequently requested indications; for the X-linked disorders, PGD is mainly carried out for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and fragile × syndrome. Sexing with FISH has been most frequently used for X-linked disorders but more and more specific DNA diagnoses have been developed. Specific DNA diagnosis has important advantages: first, healthy male embryos are not discarded; and second, female carriers can be identified and excluded from transfer or not, according to the wishes of the patient and the policy of the center.PGD is currently available for more than 200 monogenic diseases and has lately also been applied for indications, such as cancer predisposition syndromes and other late-onset diseases, for which prenatal diagnosis is ethically difficult [7, 8]. For cancer predisposition syndromes that are not fully penetrant and for which some form of therapeutic measures may be available, prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy remain controversial. As the preimplantation embryo is often considered as having less moral value than a fetus, PGD seems a more acceptable option.Another more recent indication is human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing of preimplantation embryos to select an embryo that is HLA compatible with an affected sibling. At birth, hematopoietic stem cells from the cord blood of the saviour baby are then used to transplant the sick sibling. HLA typing alone is carried out for acquired diseases, such as severe aplastic anemia, or HLA typing is combined with the detection of mutations underlying immunodeficiencies and hemoglobin disorders [9–11]. The major ethical objection here is that the future child may be regarded as an instrument and not as an autonomous person. This concern was studied in depth and it was concluded that considering the efforts of the parents to cure the sick child and their wish for another child, it is unlikely that they would treat the saviour child solely as a donor. In addition, it is universally accepted to rely on an existing HLA-compatible child as a donor of hematopoietic stem cells [12].So far, few clinical cycles have been carried out for families carrying heteroplasmic mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations [13–15]. The genetics of mtDNA is quite complex and the proportion of mutant mtDNA transmitted from mother to offspring will vary due to a genetic bottleneck in the oocytes [16]. It is another ethically difficult indication, as the possibility exists that there are no zero-mutation embryos for transfer but just embryos with a low mutation load (that is, the ratio of mutant to normal mtDNA) under a certain disease-specific threshold, meaning that the risk for an affected child is not eliminated but only reduced. PGD for mtDNA mutations can only be offered reliably when certain criteria are fulfilled: a close correlation between the mutation load and disease severity is a first requirement; second, there should be no change in mutation load with time; and third, mutant mtDNA should be uniformly distributed over all blastomeres of the cleavage-stage embryo [17]. For many mtDNA mutations the latter information is not available. Therefore, it is recommended to develop PGD within a scientific research protocol and to counsel prospective parents adequately and inform them that a first PGD cycle may be carried out merely to gather information on the reliability of PGD [18].","The first step in a PGD cycle is controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, aimed at obtaining a large cohort of mature oocytes. The aspirated oocytes are denuded of surrounding cumulus cells before IVF occurs. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is preferred over regular IVF, regardless of the sperm quality, in order to avoid residual sperm adhering to the zona pellucida after IVF. Remaining cumulus or sperm cells may lead to contamination when PCR is used for diagnosis [19].The biopsy procedure involving breaching of the zona pellucida and removal of the cell(s) can be carried out at different developmental stages [20]. Polar body (PB) biopsy from oocytes (first PB from metaphase II oocytes and second PB after normal fertilization) is a first possibility [21]. As PBs do not contribute to normal fertilization or embryonic development, their removal has no detrimental effect. In countries where embryo selection is forbidden, PB biopsy is the only legal option as testing can take place before syngamy, which is the moment considered as the beginning of an embryo. The main disadvantage is that PB analysis can only evaluate the maternal genetic contribution. The ESHRE PGD consortium data collection indicates that cleavage-stage biopsy at day 3 is used in the majority of PGD cycles [6]. At this eight-cell stage, embryo compaction has not started yet and cells are considered to be totipotent. The zona pellucida opening is mostly carried out with a non-contact diode infrared laser and one or two nucleated blastomeres are aspirated [22]. The impact of the random removal of one or two embryonic cells on further development and implantation potential is highly debated. In a recent prospective analysis of a cohort of single-embryo transfers, the authors demonstrated that the live birth rate after one-cell removal from eight-cell embryos (37.4%) is similar to the rate of a control intracytoplasmic sperm injection group without biopsy (35.0%), but significantly higher than the rate of the two-cell biopsy study group (22%). It is therefore recommended to biopsy one cell, provided that an accurate and reliable diagnosis method is in place [23]. Another limitation of cleavage-stage biopsy is the high chromosomal mosaicism rate that seems inherent at this developmental stage and probably evolves to lower rates at the blastocyst stage via self-correction [24]. Trophectoderm (TE) biopsy at day 5 is a fast emerging biopsy approach. Some reports suggest that it may yield substantially higher implantation and live birth rates than cleavage-stage biopsy [25–27]. About 4 to 20 extra-embryonic TE cells are aspirated and the inner cell mass, from which the fetus will develop, is kept intact. This is one advantage compared with cleavage-stage biopsy; another advantage is that multiple cells are available for genetic testing, and this may improve diagnostic accuracy. The drawbacks of TE biopsy are that it requires a successful embryo culture system with high blastocyst rates and it leaves limited time for genetic analysis. The time problem may be solved by freezing the blastocysts, relying on efficient vitrification and thaw-survival protocols, and transferring them later in a natural cycle.After biopsy, (single) cells are washed and either fixated for FISH analysis or tubed and lysed for amplification. Amplification reaction components are added directly to the lysed cells without prior DNA purification.","In principle, any monogenic disease for which the chromosomal locus has been identified can be diagnosed at the single-cell level. The golden standard today is fluorescent multiplex PCR in which one of each primer pair is fluorescently labeled, allowing subsequent detection of PCR fragments on an automated sequencer. In indirect tests, multiple short tandem repeat markers are co-amplified together in one reaction (linkage-based strategy); for direct testing, markers are combined with specific mutation(s). The main advantage of linkage-based testing over mutation-specific testing is that the single-cell protocols can be used for several couples, independent of the mutation they carry. This saves time, resources and manpower in pre-PGD workups for diseases for which many private mutations have been identified. The use of polymorphic markers implicates that during pre-PGD work up, informativity and segregation tests are performed on DNA samples of the couple and family members to establish which alleles of the informative markers segregate with the mutation. Different strategies of PCR and allele discrimination have been developed for mutation detection over recent years, and the most important ones are: amplification refractory mutation system [28], endonuclease restriction [29], minisequencing [30] and quantitative real-time PCR [26]. PCR-based protocols with short tandem repeat markers have recently also been applied in PGD cycles for structural chromosome abnormalities, in which FISH has been traditionally the preferred method [31, 32]. A major bottleneck with PCR assays is that the single-cell adaptation and validation part of the pre-PGD work up has to be repeated with every new DNA locus. In recent years, the use of single-cell whole genome amplification (WGA) as a universal step has been demonstrated to be a practical and efficient alternative to single-cell PCR. The first WGA methods were PCR-based and suffered from incomplete genome coverage and amplification bias, but the more recent methods are markedly better [33]. One method is multiple displacement amplification that relies on isothermal strand displacement amplification with Phi29 DNA polymerase. This method is very straightforward but requires high-quality DNA as the template, and yields relatively high allele drop-out (ADO) and preferential amplification rates of 25% on average [34]; this is about five times higher than with fluorescent multiplex PCR. Other WGA methods involve somewhat more complex protocols with DNA fragmentation and library formation prior to amplification; they even amplify low-quality DNA, and ADO rates are approximately 10% [35]. Single-cell WGA generates micrograms of amplified DNA, which is sufficient for several downstream applications. Multiple standard PCR assays may be performed for haplotyping in case of monogenic diseases [36]. Haplotyping can also be combined with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for the detection of chromosomal imbalances. These strategies are already clinically applied in some centers. Further improvement and generalization will come from the introduction of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, which enable evaluation of DNA haplotyping and chromosomal constitution on the same platform. The validation of these SNP arrays is ongoing [37, 38]. The implementation of these new technologies will reduce the procedures substantially and introduce automation. On the other hand, these arrays will generate a tremendous amount of genetic data - for instance, on disease susceptibility genes - and it is expected that this will entail many ethical discussions and challenges for genetic counseling."
1,Addition of multiple rare SNPs to known common variants improves the association between disease and gene in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data,"Recent technological advances have made querying the importance of genetic factors on the occurrence of disease severity possible. Hundreds of published studies have acknowledged associations between certain genes and various medical conditions. Newer advances in genotyping technology have allowed researchers to determine even more precisely which genetic base pair may be a marker for the mutation responsible for causing a disease by looking at single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs are DNA sequence variations that occur when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) in the genome is altered. Each individual has many SNPs that together create the unique human DNA pattern [1]. These base differences usually have a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 1% or more; SNPs with MAFs less than 1% are known as rare [2]. Previously, because of the popular common disease/common variant hypothesis, which assumes that common diseases are caused by common variants with small to modest effects [3], and because of the lack of proper technology to accurately genotype rare variants, most association studies have focused on common variants. The near complete 1000 Genomes Project will allow for more accurate genotyping of the so-called rare variants and, as a result, for consideration of rare variants as possible causes of disease [4].A change in thought has occurred to increase the importance of rare variants in disease susceptibility [5]. Although several common SNPs have shown significant associations with diseases, these effect sizes have always been small, contributing to the idea that there must be some causal factor in the previously undiscovered rare variants [5]. Several known genetic diseases, such as schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes, have turned up only a few links in the form of the common variants, and it is now thought that common variants could be picking up a diluted signal that is instead caused by neighboring rare variants [5]. Few statistical methods exist for analyzing the role of rare variants, with most methods resulting in low power [3], and it is imperative to develop new methods to analyze these data. Because the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17) data set is dominated by rare variants (about 74%), the goal of this study is to investigate the potential for combinations of rare variants to strengthen the association between common variants and disease.","The GAW17 data set consists of 24,487 SNPs on 22 chromosomes for 697 unrelated individuals. Thirty percent of the individuals are known to be affected with the disease, and individual quantitative and binary disease traits, Age, Sex, and Smoking status were simulated 200 times. The underlying simulation model is presented by Almasy et al. [6]. We had no knowledge of the genes simulated to be associated with disease outcome when developing and testing our method.We chose significant clinical parameters by fitting a multivariate logistic regression model with all the possible covariates (Age, Sex, Smoking status, and Ethnicity) and performing backwards selection. Significance was determined by calculating the 95% percentile intervals based on the 200 replicates and choosing only those covariates for which the percentile interval did not include 0.We first tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both affected and unaffected populations over all 200 phenotype replicates [7]. An adjusted p-value of 10−5 was used to correct for multiple testing in light of the fact that many of the SNPs are correlated. Those SNPs that failed the HWE test in both subpopulations in at least 95% of the replicates were eliminated from further analysis because these SNPs were thought to be privy to genotyping errors.Because the frequency of each of the rare variants in this data set is so low (40% of the SNPs have only a single copy of the minor allele out of the 697 observations), attempting to model the relationship between each rare SNP and the disease outcome is not feasible. Even attempting to combine all the rare SNPs within a gene would not be possible because few genes have a large number of rare SNPs (Table 1). Under these conditions, the models would fail to converge in many of the phenotypes. Therefore we decided to test combinations of multiple rare variants with one common variant in a gene. Our interest lies in identifying groups of rare SNPs that will better predict the disease when added to the common SNP than in simply identifying the common SNP alone.Table 1 Breakdown of number of rare SNPs per geneFull size tableFor each gene g, we consider common SNPs c
j
 (j = 1, …, n

) and rare SNPs r
s
 (s = 1, …, n
g

r
), where n
g

c
 and n

r
 are the number of common and rare SNPs on gene g, respectively. For all SNPs, we assume a dominant model in which a SNP is coded 1 when a minor allele is present and 0 otherwise. Because of the low frequency of rare SNPs, we thought that the dominant model would provide the best power.For individual i, i = 1, …, 697, we define disease status as:
                    (1)
                For each c
j
 on gene g, we fit the following multivariate logistic regression model on phenotype k (k = 1, …, 200):
                    (2)
                where P = P(Y = 1) and 1cj>0 is a binary indicator variable representing the presence of the minor allele in common SNP c
j
.. The 200 coefficients β1,1, …, β1,200 are recorded.We create a new indicator variable z to measure the presence of rare variants within a gene:
                    (3)
                By narrowing the search to only those common variants that show reproducibility over the 200 replicates at the 0.1 significance level (which would imply more stable coefficient estimates), we then fit a new multivariate logistic regression model with a binary indicator variable that represents the presence or absence of any minor allele within the gene:
                    (4)
                We use the binary approach to increase the power to detect an association resulting from the low frequency of the minor alleles. We then compare the 200 coefficients γ1,1, …, γ1,200 by means of a one-sided paired t test to β1,1, …, β1,200 to ascertain whether there is a consistent departure from the null hypothesis that:
                    (5)
                If p < 0.05, then adding the rare variants to the common variant significantly increases the signal of the effect of the gene on disease. Therefore these rare variants must be associated with the disease.If no associations are found, we remove one rare SNP from the definition of Eq. (3) and recalculate the coefficients from Eq. (4) as before. This method is used to determine whether or not no association was detected because of too much noise resulting from the addition of too many rare variants. This method can be generalized through an iterative process by removing one rare SNP at a time until only a single rare SNP remains.","The initial set of 24,487 SNPs was reduced to 24,211 because 276 SNPs failed the HWE assumption. Ethnicity was categorized into three dummy variables representing individuals of African, Asian, and European descent. The covariates Age and Smoking status were established as the only clinical parameters for this data set (Figure 1). Any associations between SNPs and disease status were adjusted for these two covariates.Figure 1Plot of the coefficients over all 200 phenotypes shows that Smoking status and Age have significant effects on diseaseFull size imageAfter HWE elimination, we were left with 3,167 genes over the 22 chromosomes. Of these 3,167 genes, 1,718 did not have any common variants or had less than two rare variants and so were excluded from the analysis because this is our primary interest. To eliminate the possibility of adding too much noise by creating a combination of many rare SNPs, we further restricted the analysis to those genes that contained fewer than 16 rare SNPs. Thus we were left with 829 genes to explore.Our results show that adding multiple rare variants to common SNPs already associated with disease at the 0.1 significance level can greatly improve the ability to detect causes of disease (Table 2). We calculated p-values from a one-sided paired t test to compare the 200 β coefficients to the 200 γ coefficients and used a p-value of 0.001 to determine significance [8]. For several of the genes, the signal of association became even stronger with the removal of one or two rare SNPs (Figure 2). In some cases, we discovered that larger combinations of rare SNPs were actually more significant, indicating that an optimal combination of rare and common SNPs could be found with this method (Table 2).Figure 2Addition of rare SNPs increases signal for detection. (a) For gene MAP3K6, a combination of four rare SNPs and one common SNP increases the signal. (b) For gene BRCA1 we show the coefficient differences between various rare and common SNP combinations and a common SNP.Full size imageTable 2 Adding a combination of rare SNPs to a common SNP significantly increases the signal of association with diseaseFull size tableWhen one or two rare SNPs were removed from the definition of Eq. (3), some genes that had not been identified by our first pass displayed an increased effect on disease (Table 2, last three rows). This suggests that adding the combination of rare SNPs to a common SNP adds information to the model and helps to better explain the relationship between gene and disease.","By taking advantage of all 200 phenotype replicates, we were able to simulate a posterior distribution for the underlying true relationship between genes and disease status, thereby inherently validating our method. When working with real data, investigators will not be able to use the replications to calculate p-values. Therefore we can apply the sample randomization technique outlined by Guo et al. [9]. This method has the following steps: (1) Calculate the coefficient for each common variant in each gene from a logistic regression model; (2) shuffle the common SNPs across the genome to generate a permuted data set; (3) calculate the coefficient from a logistic regression between common variant and disease; (4) repeat steps 2 and 3 1,000 times to obtain a null distribution of coefficients; and (5) determine which common variants are significant (at α = 0.1) by calculating the percentage of coefficients from the null distribution that are greater than the observed coefficient. This percentage is our p-value. Finally, adding all the rare SNPs to the common variant, we repeat steps 1–5 to determine which rare SNPs significantly improve the association from the common variant alone.Although our study focused on binary disease outcome, our method can also be applied to continuous or time-to-event outcomes. The dominant model assumption for the SNPs could also be adjusted to use additive or recessive models. Our method improves on the collapsing method introduced by Li and Leal [3] by separately considering common variants shown to have disease influence and by adjusting for other factors.In the interest of time and computational abilities, we limited our analysis to those genes with less than 16 rare SNPs. Important associations may occur in genes with greater than 16 SNPs. In the future it may also be of interest to consider separately those SNPs that are synonymous and nonsynonymous or to include rare SNPs that fall just outside a gene in a larger genomic region in, say, a pathway-based analysis. Our analysis was stopped before considering a maximum removal of two rare SNPs from the combination of all rare SNPs in one gene. A more exhaustive search could uncover new relationships. Our intention was to conduct a proof of principle analysis to exhibit the merits of this method in finding rare SNPs associated with disease.After the GAW17 conference, we compared the performance of our method to the simulated answers. For the correctly identified gene PTK2B, removal of simulated SNP C8S900 actually improved the disease association. This could be a result of high correlation with the other simulated SNPs for that gene. Table 3 shows that our method detected a large number of false positives and yielded a sensitivity of only 8.3%. However, our method had quite a high specificity rate of 98.5%. It must be noted that underlying correlation could create hidden relationships not specified in the simulated model.Table 3 Gene-based comparison of our method with simulated answersFull size table"
2,"Germline, hematopoietic, mosaic, and somatic variation: interplay between inherited and acquired genetic alterations in disease assessment","Widespread availability of techniques for deep sequencing of the human genome has accelerated the rate at which the genetic basis of inherited and somatic conditions is revealed. With massively parallel next-generation sequencing, it is possible to accurately detect mutations in small subsets of cells that were undetectable using Sanger sequencing methods. In addition to mutations associated with cancer, low-frequency somatic mutations associated with local tissue proliferations and vascular malformations typical of mosaic overgrowth syndromes have recently been discovered. Extensive genomic analyses of a large number of patients with varying phenotypes have exposed a complex relationship between pathogenic variants identified in the context of inherited and acquired conditions.","Deeper understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships in inherited and somatic disease is enabling innovative clinical diagnostics for precision medicine, but we must understand the range of biological possibilities that may explain the genetic data. For example, classic assumptions about inherited variants associated with cancer predisposition have recently been challenged; these assumptions include the need for multiple affected generations, mutations in specific genes being related to a specific spectrum of cancers, or that variants detected in peripheral blood reflect only the germline. Cancers with a strong gender-specific incidence may be passed through the opposite-sex parental lineage, giving the false impression that there is not a heritable syndrome present [1]. It has also become clear that the genotype–phenotype relationship with disease is broader than previously appreciated [2] and that variants detected in blood may be of somatic origin [3].Here, we describe four key areas where there is interplay between germline and somatic genetic mutations that need be considered in relationship to an observed phenotype for the correct variant interpretation in a clinical context. The four areas we will address are: 1) germline pathogenic variants discovered as part of tumor-based testing, 2) tumor-based testing performed for the purpose of clarifying germline mutation status, 3) somatic mutations detected in peripheral blood as part of cancer predisposition testing, and 4) mosaic mutations detected in somatic overgrowth syndromes (Fig. 1). Current guidelines for interpretation of inherited genetic variants, such as from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology, do not adequately address clinical context or somatic biological phenomena in the classification schema. Furthermore, there are not yet widely accepted guidelines for interpretation of variants identified in cancer. As the field moves forward, variant interpretation schema that take into account the clinical context of the individual patient, and the biological processes described here, will allow more accurate variant assessment.Fig. 1Genetic variation attributable to distinct biological processes. Variants detected by genetic testing may fall into at least four categories, including inherited germline variants, post-zygotic somatic mosaic mutations, lineage-restricted somatic mutations, such as in age-related clonal hematopoiesis, and somatic mutations related to cancer (neoplasia)Full size image
","In the course of tumor-based testing, germline cancer predisposition mutations are more frequently identified than in the general population because many cancers have a heritable component. Furthermore, these mutations may not be anticipated because of a lack of a strong family history of cancer, sex-specific incidence of certain neoplasms [1], or incomplete penetrance or hypomorphic mutations [4].Genomic interrogation of cancers has been undertaken in various forms for decades, but the advent of quantitative, single-nucleotide-resolution data of genetic aberrations in cancer has been revolutionary. Recent data reveal that pathogenic genetic variants identified within cancer tissues are of germline origin in about 10 % of both childhood and adult cancers unselected for family cancer history [5, 6]. In these studies, loss of heterozygosity or additional somatic mutations suggest that germline mutations were significantly related to the development of cancer. These findings highlight that one must consider the possibility of a germline origin for pathogenic variants when evaluating cancer tissue, even in the absence of a family history.","Cancer tissue can provide useful information regarding the origin of an observed phenotype and for inferring germline genetic status. The best example of this is Lynch syndrome, a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by inherited mutations in mismatch repair genes. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed to help identify individuals who are at risk of carrying a germline mutation based on the tumor phenotype, and these individuals are typically referred for germline analysis of the implicated genes if the screening test results are abnormal. People with abnormal screening results can often be classified with regard to their germline genetic risk of Lynch syndrome, but a subset of patients cannot be classified using the commonly used methods and are generally treated as carriers of risk alleles that cannot be currently identified (“Lynch-like” or “suspected Lynch”) [7, 8]. Genomic analysis of cancer tissues in this subgroup of patients has revealed that up to 70 % of these unresolved cases are due to multiple somatic mutations in mismatch repair genes that explain the screening results [8]. Identification of somatic mutations as the cause of a positive Lynch-syndrome-screening test allows de-escalation of ongoing cancer-surveillance programs in these individuals and their families. Correct classification of tumors into sporadic or Lynch syndrome-related is important for future surveillance activities or selecting effective therapies, regardless of the genetic origin of their mismatch repair deficiency. This example highlights that genetic mechanisms for a tumor phenotype may be varied, with implications for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management."
