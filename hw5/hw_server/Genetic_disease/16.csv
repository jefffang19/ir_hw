0,PReS-FINAL-2355: Comparison of pediatric and adult SLE genetic load,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease that is the result of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Specific genes have been found to be related to the development of SLE and also single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated to this condition. Although patients with pediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) and adult-onset SLE (aSLE) differ in disease presentation, activity, and outcomes, all studies to date have not found any specific or unique set of genes in pSLE compared to aSLE. Moreover, it has been shown that the frequency of genes in these two SLE populations is the same. However, is possible that an increased genetic load may explain the earlier onset and more severe disease seen in pSLE as compared to aSLE patients.",· To determine if patients with pSLE are more likely to have higher genetic load of SNP's associated with SLE than patients with aSLE· To investigate if this genetic load follows an age-related gradient.· To define if the higher genetic load in pSLE is associated with more severe disease in this population,study design and patients: This is a cross-sectional study of approximately 1000 pSLE and1000 aSLE patients. Adult and pediatric cohorts were obtained from centers in USA and Canada.Inclusion criteria: SLE patients who are followed at the participating centers and who meet at least 4 of 11 ACR classification criteria for this disease are eligible for study.,Disease severity will be measured by major organ involvement and damage (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index (SLICC-DI))
