0,Genetic susceptibility to antibody-mediated arthritis,"The K/BxN model of murine inflammatory arthritis has provided exciting insights into this rheumatoid-like disease. The model emerged serendipitously from the intercross of T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice x nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (See Additional information [1]). Erosive arthritis occurred spontaneously in all the offspring. Arthritis was found to be intiated following recognition by the transgenic TCR of a glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) peptide, presented by the NOD class II molecule, I-Ag7. Transfer of serum from arthritic mice, containing anti-GPI antibodies was shown to induce arthritis in recipients, even if they were devoid of T and B cells. This paper explores the genetic basis for the variable susceptibility of different strains of inbred mice to serum-mediated arthritis.","Transfer of serum from arthritic K/BxN mice produced four categories of response in different inbred mouse strains: rapid and severe joint inflammation (Balb/c), slower and less severe (B6, DBA/1, CBA), slow and low-grade (SJL, 129/Sv), resistant (NOD, NZB, DBA/2). The crossing of strains with different susceptibilities indicated that the interaction of several genes was responsible for this effect.In (B6 x NOD)F2 mice, homozygosity for the NOD-derived C5 allele (n/n) conferred resistance to arthritis transfer. Homozygotes for the B6-derived C5 allele (b/b) showed more severe disease than heterozyogotes (b/n). A genome screen was applied to 132 susceptible F2 mice with either b/b or b/n C5 genotypes. Two major qualitative trait loci were identified, one corresponding to the C5 locus on chromosome 2 and the second, on chromosome 1, close to the locus encoding the Fc?RII. Further studies using fcgr2 deficient mice and B6 mice congenic for the NOD fcgr2 allele failed to substantiate a role for this locus in conferring susceptibility to arthritis transfer.","Inflammatory arthritis is the culmination of several steps in the immune cascade. This study facilitates the identification of genetic influences on this process by utilising inbred mouse strains and by isolating a late step in the development of arthrits, distal to the influence T- and B-cell function. Two major quantitative trait loci are identified and strong evidence implicating the complement C5 locus is presented. The similarity between evidence accruing for the role of immune complexes in arthritis in this model and collagen-induced arthritis is striking (see Additional information [2]).Further work is required to map the allele(s) responsible for the second quantitative trait locus defined and to determine whether the weaker linkages identified are real. These data will prompt functional studies concerning the role of C5 in early synovial inflammatory events and will restimulate interest in complement components as therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis.","Arthritis induction by serum transfer from arthritic K/BxN mice to a panel of inbred strains, PCR -based genotyping of loci, Genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci"
1,Genetic variability of Hepatitis B virus in Morocco,"Morocco is a medium-level epidemic country for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). However, little is known about clinical, virologic and phylogenetic features of HBV infection. The aim of the present study is to determine the HBV genetic variability, and its association with clinical outcome and severity of disease in Moroccan HBV carriers.","The study included 250 chronic HBV infection patients at different stages of liver disease (156 male and 94 female). Serum samples were tested for serological markers and HBV DNA levels. The HBV Surface and core promoter/precore regions were amplified and directly sequenced. The clinical, virologic and phylogenetic characteristics were investigated.","The mean age of patients was 44 ± 12.2. Most of them were HBeAg negative (90%). The mean HBV DNA was 475104 ± 160591 UI/mL. Phylogenetic analysis identified 90% isolates in genotype D and 10% in genotype A. Most genotypes D isolates belonged to subgenotype D7 (80%) followed by subgenotype D1 (25%) and one isolate belonged to subgenotype D2. All genotype A strains belonged to subgenotype A2 and specified subtype adw2. In genotypes D strains, subtypes ayw2 (91.7%), ayw3 (3.3%) and ayw4 (3.3%) were identified. A significance prevalence of mutations in the Major Hydrophilic Region (MHR) of HBsAg was found with P120T/S the most frequent. In the core promoter region, the most frequent mutations are G1757A (48.9%), T1773C (42.8%), C1766GÂ /T (40.8%), T1753V (30.7%) and A1762T/G1764A (24.4%). In the precore region, the most common mutations are G1896A (55.1%) and G1899A (34.6%). Double mutation in the core promoter A1762T/G1764A was found more frequently in HCC patients than that in non HCC patients (66.6 % vs 16.2%; p<0.001). In addition, the prevalence of C1653T, T1753V, and G1862T mutations was significantly higher in HCC patients compared with non HCC. However, the prevalence of the G1896A precore mutation was not different between patients with HCC and HBV carriers without HCC (55.5% vs 55%; p>0.05).",We described for the first time that Subgenotype D7/ayw2 is the most predominant in Morocco. The high frequency of mutations in the core promoter in patients with HCC indicates their association with severity of infection.
2,"Phenylketonuria - genetic, clinical and therapeutic aspects","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism caused by mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. It is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders, with a high frequency (around 1/10,000) among Caucasians.","The normal route for Phe metabolism is its hydroxylation to tyrosine, catalyzed by PAH and requiring tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor. The human PAH gene is located on chromosome 12q23.2 and contains 13 exons. More than 500 disease-causing mutations have been identified in patients with PKU or hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), 67% of them being missense mutations. Most of them result in severe enzyme deficiency generating the PKU phenotype, but some are associated with a ”non-PKU HPA” phenotype. Since the PAH gene is biallelic, most patients are compound heterozygotes.","Untreated PKU is associated with an abnormal phenotype including growth failure, microcephaly, seizures and intellectual impairment. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities involves the neurotoxic effects of hyperphenylalaninaemia, which are linked to Tyr deficiency (leading to a decrease in catecholamine neurotransmitters), the effect of elevated Phe concentrations on transport of other aminoacids across the blood brain barrier, accumulation of toxic by-products of Phe metabolism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed white matter lesions in the brain of adult PKU patients, including hypomyelination and demyelination.","Newborn screening programs exist in many countries, based on the detection of a high blood Phe concentration. Conventional PKU diagnosis is based on the aberrant metabolic phenotype and the detection of disease causing mutations at the PAH locus. Available methods include Southern blotting, restriction enzyme digestion, gene sequencing. PKU mutation analysis is particularly useful in the detection of carriers, for prenatal diagnosis."
3,"Roles of the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase in nervous system development, function and disease","HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing protein 1 (Huwe1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is highly conserved across the animal kingdom [1,2,3,4] (Fig. 1a). While rodent, zebrafish and fly orthologs are also generally referred to as Huwe1, the C. elegans ortholog is called Enhancer of EFL-1 (EEL-1) based on its discovery in genetic screens. Early studies found that Huwe1 was involved in regulating tumor cell proliferation/suppression, apoptosis, responses to DNA damage and embryogenesis [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Many of these initial studies refer to Huwe1 by other names including Mule, ArfBP1, Lasu1, HectH9 or Ureb1. More recently, Huwe1 was shown to have important roles in the immune system and myogenesis [9,10,11].

Extensive human genetic studies have provided compelling evidence implicating Huwe1 in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms of X-linked intellectual disability (ID). In this review, we discuss how Huwe1 contributes to nervous system development, function and disease. We hope that exploring this literature encourages further studies on Huwe1 in the nervous system, and highlights valuable directions for future investigation from both a basic science and disease perspective.","Huwe1 is a ubiquitin ligase in the HECT family, a group of E3 ubiquitin ligases that function as single subunit enzymes [5, 12]. A striking feature of Huwe1 is its enormous size — well over 4000 amino acids (Fig. 1a). Huwe1 has numerous protein domains including a catalytic ubiquitin ligase domain, several domains involved in ubiquitin binding, and multiple conserved domains of unknown function (Fig. 1a and Fig. 4). The best characterized domain is the HECT domain, which is located at the C-terminus and is the catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that conjugates ubiquitin to substrates [13, 14]. Other domains involved in ubiquitination include a UBA domain that binds polyubiquitin chains, a WWE domain that mediates protein-protein interactions during ubiquitination, and a ubiquitin binding motif (UBM) that contains several repeated sequences and binds ubiquitin (previously called DUF4414). There is also an extremely small Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) that is a protein-protein interaction region, and only present in vertebrate isoforms of Huwe1. Two studies have solved the structure of the HECT domain [13, 14]. Interestingly, the Huwe1 HECT domain forms a dimer, which leads to autoinhibition of catalytic ubiquitin ligase activity [14]. At present, the functional roles of many domains in Huwe1 remain unknown, and the biochemical mechanisms that allow for substrate specificity are unclear. The full complement of proteins that interact with Huwe1 and potential non-ubiquitin ligase mechanisms of Huwe1 function also remain largely unexplored.Interest in Huwe1 function in the nervous system becomes apparent when one simply considers how broadly expressed this molecule is across animal nervous systems. In both humans and rodents, Huwe1 is expressed throughout the adult brain with particularly strong expression in the olfactory bulb, superficial layers of the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum (Fig. 1b) [15,16,17]. In adult C. elegans, the Huwe1 ortholog EEL-1 is expressed broadly throughout the nervous system. This includes sensory neurons, the nerve ring (a central bundle of hundreds of axons), and the motor neurons of the nerve cord (Fig. 1c) [18]. The broad expression of Huwe1 in adult mammalian and C. elegans nervous systems is consistent with Huwe1 having widespread, important roles in the nervous system, which we discuss further.","Mammalian nervous systems are composed of millions to billions of neurons. Waves of cell proliferation in various regions of the developing brain are critical to achieve these large numbers. Two particularly important regions for brain growth are the ventricular zone (VZ) of the neocortex (Fig. 2a) and the external granule layer (EGL) of the cerebellum (Fig. 2b). Proliferation of neural stem cells and neural progenitors takes place in deep layers of the neocortex. As precursors differentiate into neurons they migrate to the cortical plate (CP). In the cerebellum, proliferation of neural progenitors occurs in the superficial EGL and differentiating neurons migrate deeper to the internal granule layer (IGL). Interestingly, Huwe1 expression is lowest in regions where proliferation of neural stems cells and progenitors occurs and expression gradually increases away from these regions where neurons are differentiating and migrating [15]. Consistent with these expression patterns, both cell-based and in vivo approaches have shown that Huwe1 plays prominent roles in early development of the nervous system.
Fig. 2HUWE1 regulates neural development. (a and b) Shown to the left are diagrams of sagittal section of mouse brain. Boxes indicate a portion of (a) cerebral cortex and (b) cerebellar cortex. Center is a schematic of Huwe1 expression in neural progenitors that are proliferating, differentiating and migrating during development in (a) cerebral cortex and (b) cerebellar cortex (white = low expression, black = high expression). To the right are molecular pathways Huwe1 regulates to affect progenitor development in (a) cerebral cortex and (b) cerebellar cortex. Note that in the cerebellum Huwe1 potentially affects two pathways in different GNP populations. c Shown is a schematic of Q neuroblast migration in C. elegans which is mediated by Wnt signaling. To the left is the molecular mechanism by which EEL-1 and HUWE1 influence Wnt signaling in neuroblast migration and mammalian cell-based assaysFull size imageThe first cell-based experiments focused on differentiation of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells into a neuronal lineage [15]. Both germline and conditional knock out of Huwe1 impaired ES cell differentiation. In cultured mouse brain slice, Huwe1 knockdown and knockout increased proliferation of cortical progenitors and reduced differentiation to neurons [15]. A subsequent in vivo study conditionally deleted the Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase domain broadly in neurons [19]. Huwe1 conditional knockouts (cKO) displayed neonatal lethality within 24 h of birth. Increased numbers of neural progenitors were observed in the developing cortex of Huwe1 cKO animals further solidifying the concept that Huwe1 inhibits neural progenitor proliferation. Consistent with this, overexpression of Huwe1 in cultured cortical slices caused the opposite phenotype, fewer dividing cells. Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity also functions later in development, as Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase cKOs displayed defects in differentiation of neurons in the cortex [19]. Taken together, these studies indicate that Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity inhibits proliferation of neural progenitors early in development, and encourages neuronal differentiation during cortical development. These functions of Huwe1 are required for proper patterning of the cortex.Because Huwe1 cKO in neurons throughout the brain resulted in lethality [19], it was plausible Huwe1 had potential roles in nervous system development outside the cortex. This was tested when Lasorella and colleagues conditionally deleted Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity in granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) and radial glia of the cerebellum using the GFAP promoter to express Cre [20]. 50% of these Huwe1 cKO mice died within 4 weeks of birth. Survivors developed ataxia consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. Similar to results in cortex, cerebellar GNPs lacking Huwe1 displayed expanded proliferation resulting in increased GNP numbers, increased EGL size, and reduced numbers of mature neurons in the IGL [20]. Abnormalities in cerebellar glia were also observed.GNPs of the developing cerebellum are not a homogenous population of cells. As a result, when Huwe1 was conditionally knocked out in a subset of GNPs that expressed the Atoh1 transcription factor, GNP differentiation was impaired [21]. Proliferation of Atoh1-positive GNPs could be affected in Huwe1 cKOs, but only when proliferation was increased in culture using the mitogenic stimulant Sonic Hedge Hog (Shh). Thus, compelling evidence from cell culture, brain slice, and multiple intact developing brain regions indicates that Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity is critical in regulating the switch from proliferation to differentiation in neural progenitors.","Let us now comment on the mechanisms by which Huwe1 regulates neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation early in development. As noted above, knockout strategies in which the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain was conditionally deleted indicated that Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity is required to switch neural progenitors from a proliferative state towards differentiation in the developing nervous system. Genetic and biochemical results indicated that this occurs because Huwe1 can ubiquitinate and inhibit two transcription factors, N-Myc and Atoh1 [15, 19, 21]. Consistent with this, N-Myc and Atoh1 are expressed in proliferating neural stem cells and progenitors, are down regulated as cells differentiate and can affect neural progenitor proliferation and/or differentiation.Affinity purification proteomics with a human neuroblastoma cell line initially identified Huwe1 as an N-Myc binding protein [15]. Several further in vitro and cell-based biochemical experiments indicated that Huwe1 polyubiquitinates N-Myc resulting in degradation by the 26S proteasome. Experiments in ES cells, cultured brain slice and intact brain showed that Huwe1 inhibits N-Myc to affect proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and progenitors. For example, Huwe1 knockout in ES cells impairs differentiation towards neural cell fates, which is rescued by N-Myc knockdown [15]. Consistent with this, levels of the N-Myc transcriptional target Cyclin D2 are elevated when Huwe1 is impaired. Similar results in cultured brain slice indicate that increased proliferation and decreased differentiation of neural progenitors caused by Huwe1 knockdown is rescued by N-Myc knockdown [15]. In developing mouse brain, Huwe1 cKO in cortex resulted in increased neuronal progenitor proliferation that was suppressed by N-Myc knockdown [19]. In both the cortex and cerebellum, loss of Huwe1 function increased N-Myc expression, and altered the N-Myc transcriptional target Cyclin D2 [19, 20]. These results indicate that Huwe1 inhibits N-Myc to affect cortical progenitor proliferation. Effects of Huwe1 on N-Myc might also influence cerebellar progenitor proliferation, but this remains unclear.Another principle gene affected by Huwe1 inhibition of N-Myc is the Notch ligand DLL3 [19]. DLL3 was discovered as a possible downstream effector of N-Myc by transcriptomics with a large number of gliomas that had differing levels of Huwe1 expression. DLL3 was confirmed as a transcriptional target of N-Myc, as N-Myc binds the DDL3 promoter and ectopic N-Myc expression increases DLL3 levels and Notch signaling. Consistent with this, Huwe1 degradation of N-Myc influences DLL3 [19]. For example, Huwe1 cKO animals display increased DLL3 mRNA and Notch1 signaling in the brain. In cultured brain slice, Huwe1 cKO causes increased neural progenitor proliferation which is suppressed by knocking down DLL3 or N-Myc. Collectively, this is strong evidence that Huwe1 directly inhibits N-Myc thereby affecting DLL3 transcription and, ultimately, neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation in the developing cortex (Fig. 2a).In the cerebellum, Huwe1 inhibition of N-Myc might affect proliferation of GNPs that express N-Myc [20], but this remains untested. A subset of cerebellar GNPs express the Atoh1 transcription factor. Huwe1 ubiquitinates and degrades Atoh1, and robustly affects development of GNPs that express this transcription factor [21]. This discovery initially stemmed from affinity purification proteomics using HEK 293 cells, which identified Huwe1 as an Atoh1 binding protein. Cell-based experiments showed that Huwe1 knockdown and overexpression affect Atoh1 ubiquitination and stability. Further supporting these findings, Huwe1 cKO resulted in increased Atoh1 protein levels in GNPs in culture and in vivo.Overexpression of Atoh1 in cultured, purified GNPs impairs differentiation, but does not affect progenitor proliferation [22]. Consistent with Huwe1 being a negative regulator of Atoh1, Huwe1 cKOs where the Atoh1 promoter was used to drive Cre expression mimicked Atoh1 overexpression phenotypes with decreased differentiation of cultured GNPs, but no effect on GNP proliferation [21]. In cultured cerebellar brain slice, Huwe1 knockdown results in impaired differentiation of GNPs. This effect was strongly suppressed when Huwe1 and Atoh1 were simultaneously knocked down [21]. Further experiments evaluating GNP differentiation in vivo using conditional knockout alleles for both Huwe1 and Atoh1 will be valuable in further evaluating this genetic relationship. Nonetheless, existing results with knockdown approaches taken together with extensive, high-quality biochemical studies support the conclusion that Huwe1 ubiquitinates and inhibits Atoh1 to affect differentiation of a subset of GNPs in the cerebellum.Interestingly, Huwe1 can inhibit proliferation of GNPs expressing Atoh1, but this only occurs when GNPs are deprived of and re-treated with Shh to stimulate proliferation [21]. This likely occurs because Shh signaling through PP2A affects dephosphorylation of Atoh1 at two serine residues. Atoh1 dephosphorylation then prevents Huwe1 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, Huwe1 and Shh-PP2A signaling display differing effects on Atoh1 stability, which influences proliferation of Atoh1 expressing GNPs (Fig. 2b).Work on cochlear development also found that Huwe1 ubiquitinates and inhibits Atoh1 to regulate hair cell differentiation [23]. This independent study reproduced proteomic and biochemical findings to confirm that Huwe1 binds and ubiquitinates Atoh1. Interestingly, Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) phosphorylation of Atoh1 affected ubiquitination by Huwe1. This provides further evidence that phosphorylation of Atoh1 affects Huwe1-mediated degradation, and demonstrates that Huwe1 inhibits Atoh1 to affect cellular differentiation in multiple cell types.In summary, Huwe1 restricts genetic programs required to switch from proliferation to differentiation in multiple types of neural progenitors. This occurs by Huwe1 ubiquitin ligase activity triggering proteasomal degradation and inhibition of the N-Myc and Atoh1 transcription factors. This compelling body of work on Huwe1 in early nervous system development has several future research directions poised to be particularly fruitful. 1) Determining how Huwe1 is regulated in the nervous system. 2) Identifying Huwe1 binding proteins that are not ubiquitination substrates, but potentially function with this enormous molecule. 3) Evaluating if further Huwe1 ubiquitination substrates, that are novel or previously identified in cell-based studies, have functional relevance in early nervous system development.There is one final point regarding nervous system disease that is worth making here. Genetic programs involved in early development of the nervous system are often hijacked in brain cancers. Indeed, genetic changes in HUWE1 are implicated in patients with glioblastoma and medulloblastoma [19, 21]. Whether HUWE1 is involved in neuroblastoma remains unknown. These intriguing initial links to cancer now encourage further research aimed at exploring how broadly and frequently HUWE1 mutations occur in different brain cancers."
4,Coverage of the Genetic Background of Breast Cancer in the Polish Population,"It is a known fact that cancer risk is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Parameters such as the kind and site of the tumour and family history depend on the proportion between both and the population determines to a great extent the characteristics of the genetic background. Here we focus on breast cancer in the Polish population.Despite complex population dynamics in the last centuries, the Poles seem to be surprisingly homogeneous in their genetics. A sequence-based screening of BRCA1 positive patients showed just 9 polymorphisms of BRCA1, where 91% of individuals shared just 3 common founder mutations [1]. The result is consistent with other Slavic countries [2–4]. In contrast, a similar screening in neighbouring Germany revealed 77 distinct BRCA1 mutations, 18 of them shared by 68% of BRCA1 positive patients [5].Highly penetrating mutations, such as those of BRCA1, are mostly detected in conspicuous family aggregations via genetic linkage studies. Therefore, they may be detected with the help of just a few families even in heterogeneous populations. However, the probability of finding a new highly penetrating gene for the Polish population seems rather low; mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 already cover ~70% of cases of strong familial aggregations of breast and ovarian cancers [1]. The advantage of genetically homogeneous populations relies instead on the increased power of finding medium- and low-risk markers via large association studies that would otherwise be blurred in more complex populations.","To date several variants of 6 genes have been demonstrated to significantly increase breast cancer risk in the Polish population: BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, NBS1, NOD2, P16 [1, 6–9]. They actually cover ~25% of early onset (<50 yrs) breast cancer cases (n = 3000). Current investigations extend those 6 genes up to 9 (data in preparation) (Fig. 1). One of them, represented as X2, includes a common variant that improves the total coverage up to 80% in a pre liminary analysis: 700 cases out of 850 showed at least one disease-associated variant of the 9 analysed genes (Fig. 2).Figure 1Frequency of different genes with variants associated with breast cancer as covering a population of 3000 early onset (<50 yrs) breast cancer patients. Genes represented as X1-X3 are still subject of study and their values refer to estimations from preliminary data. Most of the genes represented include several disease-associated variants. The last column stands for the relative risk of each of themFull size imageFigure 2Time sequence of the growth of the sample database (dashed line) in number of patients (note: the number of genotyped samples is actually 3500) and the improvement of the coverage of disease-associated genetic factors in the same population (continuous line). The percentage of coverage is based on estimations for different numbers of patients depending on the specific genes involved: 3000 patients for BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, NBS1, NOD2 and P16; and 850 patients for those genes and the ones referred as X1, X2 and X3 (currently under study). The approximately onset of systematic analyses for the respective genes is indicated with an arrow and the gene's acronymFull size imageThose values should drop for cases with onset at older ages as the cumulative exposure to external carcinogenic agents increases. Nevertheless, in familial aggregations of breast and ovarian cancer that percentage is expected to be higher since just BRCA1 and BRCA2 account already for almost 70% of cases. Both analyses have still to be performed.","The Polish population appears to be a useful group for detecting low-risk markers of cancer. It is large (~40 m) and homogeneous enough to reach the statistical power necessary to detect small but still significant differences in cancer risk. Our actual knowledge of disease-associated genetic factors present in breast cancer cases is ~70% for familial aggregations and ~80% for early onset consecutive cases. Thanks to the parallel growth of the network country-wide for sample and data exchange and the genetic variants under analysis, we expect to approach 100% in the near future.But even in such a scenario, the detection of a single predisposing genetic factor does not exclude the presence of additional ones. In fact, the current model predicts that the interplay between several genetic factors of low penetrance when analysed separately may increase the risk (either additively or synergically) to values comparable to much more penetrating ones (Fig. 3) [10]. Therefore, the search for new low-risk markers should continue even beyond the theoretical 100% of coverage, and bioinformatic analyses of the interplay among these factors should improve their application in clinical practice.Figure 3Ideographic representation of the relationship between penetrance of the predisposing genetic factors and the proportion of the population of patients they are present in. Genes with highest penetrance are rather uncommon, in contrast to those with low penetrance, which can be very frequent. However, the interaction between different low penetrance factors may again increase the penetrance of the compoundFull size image","Byrski T (1), Castaneda J (1), Cybulski C (1), Czajka R (2), Dębniak T (1), Domagała W (3), Dziuba J (1), Gliniewicz B (7), Górski B (1), Gozdecka-Grodecka S (10), Grabowska-Kłujszo E (4), Gronwald J (1), Haus O (11), Huzarski T (1), Jakubowska A (1), Janiszewska H (11), Kowalska E (1), Kurzawski G (1), Lener M (4), Lubiński J (1), Marczyk E (12), Masojć B (1), Matyjasik J (1), Mędrek K (1), Mierzejewski M (1), Mituś J (12), Narod SA (6), Nej-Wołosiak K (4), Oszurek O (1), Posmyk M (8), Scott R (13), Serrano-Fernandez P (1), Sikorski A (14), Stawicka M (15), Suchy J (1), Surdyka D (16), Szwiec M (9), Szymańska A (1), Szymańska-Pasternak J (1), Teodorczyk U (1), Tołoczko-Grabarek A (1), Urbański K (12), Wandzel P (17), Witek A (5), Woyke S (3), Złowocka E (1).

5,Silver-Russell syndrome: genetic basis and molecular genetic testing,"Over the past 20 years it has become increasingly clear that genomic imprinting is of great relevance for human diseases. Imprinted genes with a parent-of-origin specific expression are involved in various aspects of growth and behaviour that are rooted in the prenatal period and indeed, many of the so far known congenital imprinting disorders (IDs) are clinically characterised by growth disturbances. While Angelman, Prader-Willi and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes (BWS) are well established IDs, imprinting defects in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) are relatively new findings.The main features of SRS [RSS; OMIM 180860] are severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, relative macrocephaly and a characteristic small, triangular face. The disease is associated with additional dysmorphic features including fifth finger clinodactyly and hemihypoplasia (table 1). Although a clinical scoring system to assist the diagnosis has recently been suggested [1], the accuracy of diagnosis is influenced by the experience of the clinical investigator. Furthermore, the clinical picture of SRS in adulthood is less clear than in early childhood.Table 1 Clinical features in SRS and their frequencies in the different molecular subgroups.(*combined from different studies by [59])Full size tableThe frequency of SRS is currently unknown, but it is probably underdiagnosed due to the broad range of features [1].The influence of genetic factors in the aetiology of SRS is documented by classical genetic findings such as familial cases of SRS and cytogenetic aberrations. Most cases of SRS are sporadic, but familial cases have been reported (for review: [2]). Duncan et al. [2] suggested that most familial cases were transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with marked intrafamilial variability. An autosomal recessive inheritance has been supposed in eight families but in six of them the clinical documentation is questionable (for review: [3]). However, in only two families a recurrence of (epi)mutations in 11p15 have been described [4].In the following, an overview on the currently known (epi)genetic disturbances in SRS will be given. We want to emphasize that the order of mutations does not reflect the importance but their chronological identification.","Several SRS patients have structural aberrations affecting numerous chromosomes, but only chromosomes 7, 11, and 17 were consistently involved in individuals fulfilling strict diagnostic criteria of SRS. Based on balanced translocations in two patients involving 17q24-q25 [5, 6], a central role of this chromosomal region in SRS aetiology had been discussed for a long time. However, characterisation of the 17q breakpoints in both patients showed that they were not identical [7]. The reported heterozygous deletions in the growth hormone (GH) gene cluster in 17q [8] are now regarded as apathogenic polymorphisms [9].However, conventional cytogenetic analysis was hampered in the past by the low microscopic resolution. Thus the development of array-based techniques for molecular karyotyping now allows the identification of cryptic imbalances which formerly escaped microscopic analysis. Meanwhile two studies reported on SRS patients carrying small deletions/duplications < 3 Mb [10, 11]. In respect to genetic counselling, conventional karyotyping should be considered in the patients' parents to detect balanced rearrangements.","Cytogenetic aberrations of chromosome 7 including duplications of 7p11.2p13 and small marker chromosomes have been identified in several SRS individuals (for review: [12, 13]). The first evidence for an involvement of this chromosome in the aetiology of the disease was based on the identification of maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD(7)mat) in ~10% of SRS individuals [14](table 1). Microsatellite typing patterns in nearly all these UPD(7)mat carriers were consistent with the mechanism of trisomic rescue. Due to the trisomic origin of UPD(7)mat it might be assumed that trisomy 7 mosaicism is involved in the aetiology of SRS. This hypothesis was corroborated by the observation of a significant increase of the frequency of completely skewed X inactivation in SRS as a marker for undetected trisomy 7 in the patients and/or their placentas [15]. Nevertheless, two studies detected neither trisomy 7 cells in leukocytes nor in fibroblasts of SRS patients [16, 17], probably due to the lethality of general trisomy 7 mosaicism and the limited number of tissues analysed.In cases of UPD, reduction to homozygosity of a recessive allele is a further cause for aberrant phenotypes, and indeed UPD was first described in a growth retarded patient with cystic fibrosis who was homozygous for a cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene mutation caused by a UPD(7)mat. Thus, recessive mutations might be regarded as causative for the SRS phenotype in UPD(7)mat patients, but there is not a common isodisomic segment. This finding excludes a ""simple"" recessive gene responsible for SRS [18].In conclusion, the most probable explanation for the SRS phenotype in UPD(7)mat carriers is the disturbed expression of imprinted genes on chromosome 7. UPD(7)mat is generally associated with growth retardation and SRS-like features whereas UPD(7)pat is not (for review: [19]). It has therefore been hypothesized that (i) a diminished expression of paternally expressed gene(s) or (ii) an overexpression of maternally expressed factor(s) on chromosome 7 causes SRS.So far, research on chromosome 7 encoded factors has focused on two chromosomal segments in 7p and 7q, respectively. For the candidate region in 7p11.2-p13 SRS patients with duplications have been reported (for review: [12, 20]). The region harbours an imprinted gene (growth factor receptor bound protein 10/GRB10) and several factors involved in human growth and development (IGFBP1; IGFBP3; PHKG1; EGFR; GHRHR). Pathogenic mutations in these genes have been excluded in SRS [for review: [21]]. In particular, GRB10 plays an essential role in growth and is therefore still a good candidate for SRS. This assumption is supported by a recently published family carrying a maternally inherited dup(7)(p11.2p12) not including GRB10 and without SRS features [13]. Nevertheless, neither point mutations in the coding region nor aberrant methylation of GRB10 have been detected in SRS patients despite extensive screening studies (for review: [22–24]).On the other hand, there is evidence that the chromosomal region 7q31 is also involved in SRS aetiology: meanwhile four growth retarded patients with segmental UPD(7q) have been identified [25–27]. In 7q31, three imprinted genes (MEST/PEG1; CPA4; COPG2) and two imprinted non-coding RNAs (MESTIT, CIT1/COPG2IT1) are localised but screening studies did not detect any pathogenic variants [for review: [21]]. Furthermore, isolated imprinting defects as reported for other imprinting disorders have not yet been detected at the MEST/PEG1 locus in SRS patients [28].Because intrauterine growth retardation has also been reported for UPDs of other chromosomes and is often associated with confined placental mosaicism in human pregnancies, several studies investigated the origin of other chromosomes by microsatellite typing in SRS patients. However, further UPDs have not been observed [29–31].","Currently, the largest molecular genetic subgroup of SRS are individuals with epimutations and mutations in the chromosomal region 11p15. First evidence for an involvement of this region in the aetiology of the disease was the identification of maternal 11p15 duplications in growth retarded patients. Four out of these six cases showed SRS features in addition to intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation (for review: [32]). Interestingly, the opposite disturbance - duplication of paternal 11p15 - is associated with BWS. Numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations can be detected in BWS patients (for review: [33]) but in more than 50% aberrant methylation patterns in 11p15 are involved. The search for epimutations in 11p15 in SRS patients was therefore consequent and indeed, hypomethylation at the telomeric ICR1 in 11p15 regulating H19 and IGF2 expression could be identified in 38-63% of cases [34–37] (table 2).Table 2 Frequencies of the different types of (epi)mutations in SRSFull size tableThe 11p15 imprinting cluster contains a number of imprinted genes the expression of which is regulated by two different imprinting control regions (ICR1 and ICR2), also called H19 DMR (differentially methylated region) and KvDMR1 (fig. 1) and which are crucial for the control of fetal growth.Figure 1Epigenetic regulation of the two imprinting centre regions (ICR) in 11p15 and illustration of the types of (epi)mutations detectable in SRS.Full size imageThe telomeric ICR1 confers a differential chromatin architecture to the two parental alleles leading to reciprocal expression of H19 and IGF2. The two genes are coexpressed in endoderm- and mesoderm-derived tissues during embryonic development and compete for the same enhancers. The paternally expressed IGF2 is involved in fetal development and growth [38, 39]. Although H19 was one of the first noncoding transcripts identified, its function is still unknown. Knockout of H19 removing the whole RNA coding sequence but leaving the promoter and surrounding transcription unit intact had no effect on the imprinted expression of IGF2[40]. These results indicate that the RNA itself might be non-functional, however the fact that H19 is a relatively highly conserved gene among mammals (77% identity between human and mouse) suggests a profound functional relevance. A recent study suggests that H19 functions as a primary micro RNA precursor involved in the posttranscriptional downregulation of specific mRNAs during vertebrate development [41]. The ICR1 contains seven CTCF target sites (CTCF1-CTCF7) in the differentially methylated region 2 kb upstream of H19 and shows allele specific methylation. The zinc-finger binding factor CTCF binds to the maternal unmethylated ICR1 copy and thereby forms a chromatin boundary. This CTCF binding mechanism blocks IGF2 expression and promotes H19 transcription of the maternal 11p15 copy.The centromeric ICR2 regulates the (reciprocal) expression of CDKN1C, KCNQ1 (potassium channel KQT-family member 1) and further genes and is methylated only on the maternal allele. Mutations in the paternally suppressed CDKN1C gene account for up to 40% of familial BWS cases and 5-10% of sporadic patients (table 1). The gene encodes a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (p57KIP2) and is part of the p21CIP2Cdk inhibitor family. Functional analysis of CDKN1C germline mutations detected in two BWS patients showed the loss of cell-cycle inhibition [42]. The gene of another non-coding RNA in 11p15, KCNQ1OT1 (LIT1), is localised in intron 9 of the KCNQ1 gene. KCNQ1OT1 is expressed by the paternal allele and probably represses realisation of the CDKN1C gene. Loss of methylation (LOM) of the maternal ICR2 allele correlates with expression of KCNQ1OT1. In BWS, one central physiological change caused by ICR2 (epi)mutations (hypomethylation at ICR2) as well as CDKN1C point mutations is the reduced expression of CDKN1C.The 11p15 epimutation in SRS is typically a hypomethylation of the telomeric ICR1 (table 1). In contrast, the most frequent alteration in BWS is hypomethylation at the centromeric ICR2 accounting for ~50% of patients, whereas ICR1 hypermethylation is diagnosed in only 2-7% of BWS patients. Clinically, the majority of ICR1 hypomethylation carriers fulfil the clinical criteria of SRS [34] but the epimutation has also been diagnosed in patients with only growth retardation and asymmetry [36, 43]. However, this disturbance has not yet been detected in individuals with isolated pre- and postnatal growth restriction [44].The recent identification of a SRS patient with a duplication restricted to the ICR2 [45] suggests that both ICRs on 11p15 are involved in the aetiology of the disease, like in BWS. This finding and further data obtained from BWS patients and from studies in mice suggest that ICR1 and ICR2 interact [46]."
6,Case-control association testing by graphical modeling for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome sequence data,"As the search for genetic variation underlying complex diseases turns to rare variants of small effect ascertained from genome-wide or exome-wide sequence data, the need for methods of disease-gene association that account for the high degree of nonindependence between densely spaced genetic variants (i.e., linkage disequilibrium [LD]) becomes increasingly critical. Failure to consider LD may result in false-positive associations. We have recently shown [1] that graphical modeling is a useful and accurate approach for estimating the LD model, or joint distribution of alleles across loci, for genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data. The use of a general decomposable graphical model for the LD structure has a number of advantages. One such advantage is the ability to incorporate discrete covariates and outcome variables into the graph, so that the associations between outcomes, covariates, and allele states can be estimated without prior knowledge or specification of a model. Here, we apply such an approach to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17) mini-exome case-control sequence data in an effort to detect genes associated with disease phenotype while controlling for LD as well as sex, age, and smoking habits. Because allele frequencies and patterns of LD are known to vary between populations, we include each individual’s population of origin as an additional covariate.","A graphical model describes the joint distribution of a set of random variables as the product of conditional distributions on smaller subsets of the variables. This factorization has a corresponding Markov (or conditional independence) graph, in which vertices represent variables and edges connect variables that appear together in the same conditional distribution (see Lauritzen and Sheehan [2] for background on graphical models). We apply a graphical modeling approach to the GAW17 data to find SNPs associated with disease phenotype and with quantitative traits Q1, Q2, and Q4 while controlling for LD and several discrete covariates. Specifically, we modified the method detailed by Abel and Thomas [1] to estimate a decomposable graphical model for the joint distribution  using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Here Y is the disease phenotype; the  are the discretized (into thirds) quantitative traits; the  are the discrete covariates (population of origin, smoking status, sex, and age) (dichotomized by the median); and the  are the alleles at loci 1 through n.For LD models for SNP genotype arrays, the structure of the conditional independence graphs tends to be long and thin, facilitating efficient computation. However, because of, for example, allele frequencies, age structure, and smoking rates that vary across populations, the incorporation of outcome variables and covariates into the model results in a more complex stellate (and thus computationally taxing) structure. We use a stepwise iterative approach to render the problem more computationally tractable.In the first step of our algorithm we estimate for all nonsynonymous variants on each chromosome the posterior most-probable population-dependent graphical model. That is, we empirically estimate a joint distribution on the ethnic origin variable and alleles at all loci with nonsynonymous variants [3]. (In general, exclusion of synonymous variants is a reasonable simplification, although synonymous mutations could induce a change of phenotype by means of, for instance, codon bias. We note that all GAW17 simulated causal variants were chosen to be nonsynonymous.) These models are estimated using a slight modification of the program FitGMLD, described by Abel and Thomas [1].Briefly, we start with arbitrarily phased haplotypes and an initial configuration for the graph in which the dependence structure for the loci is a second-order Markov chain and in which all loci are associated with the population of origin. The best-fitting graphical models are then estimated using simulated annealing through a method that iterates between rounds of decomposability-preserving Metropolis graph updates and blocked Gibbs phase updates based on the current structure of allele associations [1, 3]. In the Metropolis update of an incumbent graph G, a new graph G′ is proposed by randomly connecting or disconnecting an appropriate pair of vertices [4]. The proposed graph G′ is then accepted with probability:
                    (1)
                otherwise the graph G remains. Here, t is the temperature parameter for the simulated annealing, and the penalized likelihood:
                    (2)
                serves as an information criterion in which the penalty depends on the graph’s degrees of freedom (df).  is the maximized graph likelihood, and α is a constant. To allow for an efficient walking-windowed estimation, we assume that alleles separated by more than 15 intervening loci are conditionally independent. We then use the obtained model to estimate the most probable phase of each genotype. We note that, although necessary in general, this step may not be required for the previously phased GAW17 data; however, it would help to mitigate any phasing or genotyping errors.The second and third steps of the algorithm are also carried out for each chromosome individually. In these steps, the haplotype phase is fixed according to the results of the first stage, and model fitting proceeds using Metropolis graph updates only. In the second step, a restricted graphical model is fitted to the full data set, including all loci, disease status, quantitative traits, and covariates. To reduce the model space and improve mixing, we enforce the restriction that edges can connect loci separated by at most 50 SNPs. We then prune the Markov graph to include only a subset of loci that are most strongly associated with any of the outcomes or covariates; that is, we restrict the subgraph to spanning all neighbors of all outcomes and covariates, with the exception of ethnic origin, up to third degree. At this stage we exclude the loci linked only to ethnic origin because they are unlikely to be relevant predictors of disease.The third step is similar to the second; at this stage, however, because of the decreased model space, we fit an unrestricted graphical model to the reduced data set. We then perform a second pruning step, this time restricting the new Markov graph to the subgraph of all first- and second-degree neighbors of all loci except ethnic origin.In the final stage of our algorithm, we combine the remaining loci from all chromosomes to determine the loci that are most strongly associated with any of the outcomes while controlling for ethic origin and all covariates. Again, we fit an unrestricted graphical model to the data. The nearest neighbors of the disease state or any of the quantitative traits are considered significantly associated (according to the information criterion given by Eq. (2)).","We performed our analysis for the first 50 replicates of the GAW17 data set. In all cases, the estimated relationships between disease status, the quantitative traits, and the measured covariates closely approximate those specified in the model used to generate the data. To illustrate the method, we depict in Figures 1 and 2 the intermediate and final model estimates for the first replicate. Typical results for two chromosomes after the third model-fitting stage are shown in Figure 1. In this instance, on chromosome 1 we detect one causal gene and one noncausal haplotype (consisting of four nonindependent loci) associated with disease status. This model suggests a direct association of trait Q1 with disease and more complex interactions between age, Q2, and disease and between Q2, Q4, and disease. Our model for chromosome 10 detects one causal haplotype and one noncausal haplotype and a single locus associated with disease status. The pattern of associations between covariates and outcomes is similar. Although our main interest here is to detect associations between variables, our program estimates marginal and conditional distributions on all subsets of variables, indicating, for instance, that the probability of disease decreases with increasing quantitative trait Q4.Figure 1Typical pruned Markov graphs after the third model-fitting stage of our algorithm. Outcome variables and covariates are shown in yellow. Correctly identified variants are indicated by red circles. Left panel: chromosome 1. Right panel: chromosome 10.Full size imageFigure 2Markov graph estimated in the final model-fitting step. SNPs are color-coded by chromosome. Outcome variables and covariates are shown in yellow. Correctly identified genes are indicated by red circles.Full size imageThe final estimated graphical model for the first replicate is shown in Figure 2. For this data set, our method detected five causal variants on four genes. Our model found three variants associated with disease status: C1S9445 in PIK3C2B, C6S2981 in VEGFA, and C10S3050 in SIRT1. All three of these variants are rare, with minor allele frequencies (MAF) of 0.0029, 0.0022, and 0.0022, respectively, and they were simulated to have additive mean effects β = 0.23, β = 1.2, and β = 0.97, respectively. We also detected two common variants, both in FLT1, associated with quantitative trait Q1: C13S522 (MAF = 0.028, β = 0.62) and C13S523 (MAF = 0.067, β = 0.65). Our algorithm also returned 13 noncausal variants (i.e., variants that were not part of the disease model). We note that, as seen in Figure 2, our best-fitting graphical models sometimes connect SNPs that influence traits Q1 and Q2 to disease status (rather than the vertices representing traits Q1 and Q2); however, this confounding is not unexpected or problematic because the disease liability was simulated as a linear combination of latent liability and the three quantitative traits (overall liability = latent liability + Q1 + Q2 − Q4).Over the first 50 simulated data sets, our graphical modeling method identified, on average, 1.4 SNPs in causal genes per data set. Of these correctly identified SNPs, 90.2% were exactly the causal SNPs rather than SNPs located elsewhere in the causal gene. Our algorithm also identified an average of 15.8 noncausal variants per replicate. Table 1 summarizes our results for the 50 replicates. SNPs are categorized as rare (MAF < 0.005) or common and as having weak (β < 0.5) or strong effect; the number of times (out of 50) that each variant was detected is indicated. Out of seven possible variants in the common and strong category, our algorithm detected three: C13S523 (FLT1) was seen in 25 replicates, C13S522 (FLT1) in 23 replicates, and C1S6533 (ARNT) in 2 replicates. Of the 57 variants in the strong and rare category, 6 were seen in at least one replicate. Of 17 common and weak variants, we observed only 1. Finally, out of 81 variants in the rare and weak category, only 1 was detected but in four distinct data replicates.Table 1 Detected causal variants categorized by minor allele frequency and strength of effectFull size table","We have shown that a graphical modeling approach can detect loci associated with complex diseases. Our method also provides a good approximation of the true associations between outcomes and covariates specified by the model. Furthermore, our method has the ability to detect environmental effects on disease as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We have demonstrated that our method has reasonable power to detect common variants of strong effect, finding mutations in the FLT1 gene in more than 70% of replicates. Furthermore, our approach shows some power to detect rare variants of large effect, detecting 6 of 57 such variants in at least one replicate. In its current implementation, our method has little power to detect variants with weak effect on phenotype; however, it did find the C10S3110 mutation in SIRT1 (MAF = 0.002152, β = 0.10) in four distinct replicates, probably because of LD between this locus and other rare mutations of stronger effect within the same gene. In general, however, our graphical modeling method is successful at controlling for LD, because it is able to pinpoint causal SNPs within causal genes more than 90% of the time.Our graphical modeling approach, which controls for population structure, linkage disequilibrium, and relevant covariates, shows considerable promise for detection of both common and rare variants from exome sequence data. However, it does have some limitations that should be addressed in future work. First, our method is purely statistical and avoids biological assumptions (except in its exclusion of synonymous variants); hence it has only weak power to detect rare variants and also tends to detect associated but noncausal variants. Inclusion of, in particular, biological pathway information into the model would help to increase power and decrease detection of spurious associated SNPs. Second, our algorithm uses simulated annealing to find the single most likely graph to represent each data set; using the MCMC method to average over many models from the posterior distribution might help to decrease the number of false positives. By identifying only the nearest neighbors of the outcome variables in the most likely model, our algorithm sometimes excludes causal SNPs in favor of other tightly linked causal or noncausal SNPs. Model averaging and incorporation of, for instance, pathway information into the model would help to increase both sensitivity and specificity by appropriately constraining the model space and considering a larger number of possible solutions. Finally, our graphical models incorporate a single (given) ethnicity variable. In general, this could pose a problem because of admixture or possibly unreliable self-reported ethnicity. We are currently developing a method to extend our LD model (the empirically estimated joint distribution of genotypes) to allow the ethnicity variable to change between loci and small clusters of loci, thus allowing for admixed and unknown ethnic origins.Despite these limitations, the flexible method of graphical modeling provides a promising approach to the challenge of detecting the genetic variation that underlies complex disease. Given such a disease that involves environmental factors and many rare variants of small effect, inclusion of relevant biological information into the model would help to elucidate the true underlying factors. Graphical modeling might provide a framework for such a systems biological tack."
7,Massively parallel rare disease genetics,"Rare diseases, defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people, encompass over 7,000 recognized entities. In aggregate they comprise about 10% of the total disease burden of humanity, and they are far from being rare (http://www.genome.gov). Rare diseases have classically been viewed as the domain of Mendelian genetics - single gene disorders with clear evidence of dominant, recessive, or sex-linked patterns of recurrence in families. As of mid-April 2011, mutations in 2,565 genes causing 4,321 disorders were cataloged in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (http://www.omim.org). The associated phenotypes involve every organ system, and include Hirschsprung disease, α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, skeletal dysplasias, ciliopathy syndromes, and a diverse collection of neurologic syndromes, to mention several for which recent research was highlighted at the meeting. Each genotype-phenotype connection made has provided a unique opportunity for insight into human physiology and pathophysiology. However, these known cases are only the tip of an emerging iceberg since thousands of additional described phenotypes exist with as yet unknown underlying mutation(s).","Our recent approach to rare diseases - centered on the search for single gene etiologies - stands in contrast to that of common disorders. Common disorders have been modeled as more dependent on multiple modifying genes and environmental factors and more complex etiologies in heritable risk. The idea that common genetic variants may be important thrusts common diseases into the forefront of genomic applications with the availability of genome-wide SNP maps. Genome-wide association studies have leveraged impressive genomic-scale methods and large numbers of cases and controls to identify important loci involved in disease susceptibility and trait variation.However, this dichotomy between common and rare diseases is simplistic and has perhaps been overemphasized. It is now widely acknowledged that common genetic variants conferring large effects are not routinely found by association studies, and rare genetic variants are gaining credibility as important contributors to common diseases. This was a central topic at this meeting. Such rare variants can be minute sequence changes or structural variants; mechanisms underlying the latter, including copy number variants (CNVs), and high copy number repeat insertions (retrotransposons), were described by James Lupski and John Moran (University of Michigan, USA), respectively. The meeting also highlighted CNVs being sought in many intensively studied 'common' disorders. For example, Pamela Sklar (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA) and Nigel Williams (Cardiff University, UK) presented in a session devoted to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, and Heather Mefford (University of Washington, USA) discussed CNVs in a session devoted to characterizing phenotypes and genotypes in epilepsy.Rare variants are certainly potential culprits in these diseases. Thus, a common phenotype may well be a collection of rare genetic diseases masquerading as a single clinical entity. It is important to note that the definition of 'common' is arbitrary and that autism and other disorders considered common are much less frequent than major chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension.","Conversely, there is no reason to assert that rare diseases will be totally explicable by mutations in single genes or rare variants. For example, common polymorphisms are known to affect susceptibility to Hirschsprung disease and cleft lip/palate. It is foreseeable that as genomic tools are applied to rare diseases en masse, the primarily Mendelian acting lesions will become evident earliest. Our collective experiences should establish the true burden of these types of mutations on human health, and this will certainly be important. What is scientifically as exciting is that hypotheses surrounding more complex segregation models for the basis of genetic disease may now become testable.Molecular methods development has been inseparable from the types of ideas that we can approach experimentally. Historically, this has meant we go to the laboratory bench enabled to address increasingly fundamental questions. Paradoxically, as our methods are now supersized to the -omics scale, we are in the position of being able to survey the genome hypothesis-free. If thinking about the genetic basis of a disease used to go hand in hand with the clinical history and physical examination, our standard starting point may soon include the patient's sequenced genome.","This newfound relevance of genomics to an individual patient case cannot be understated. Our historic needs for large kindreds to refine the relevant genetic interval and cumbersome analyses for positional cloning have limited the diseases amenable to study. It is a tremendously exciting prospect that an astute clinician and a single memorable patient can now become the critical participants in identifying the fundamental molecular defect in that individual. Our ability to sequence DNA in many ways has defined genetics. We believe our ability to massively parallel sequence genomes will be credited with a massive paralleling of clinical genetics investigations. And we expect great progress as the field opens to a great plurality of research purposes.So what does one clinician or a small research team do with all these sequences? That we have a lot to learn about managing the datasets that genomic methods provide was a recurring theme in Hinxton. Fundamental questions include how to grasp and incorporate the spectrum of human genetic diversity in searches for causative variants and how to predict causality from among the large numbers of candidate variants. Aspects of these challenges were discussed by Daniel MacArthur and Matt Hurles (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), Shamil Sunyaev (Brigham and Women's Hospital, USA), and Dominik Seelow (Charité University Hospital, Germany). The need to intelligently filter information cannot be understated and is still a developing art."
8,The genetic basis of mood and anxiety disorders – changing paradigms,"In contrast to other medical disorders, diagnoses for psychiatric disorders are still mostly based on verbal report and observation and not biological measures. It is thus very likely that our symptom-based diagnoses include patients with different primary pathophysiological disturbances and thus likely predisposing genetic variants reducing the power of genetic association studies. In addition, our diagnostic scheme may separate individuals with common genetic risk factors into different categories. For example, it is likely that bipolar disorder patients share genetic susceptibility loci with patients with major depression as well as schizophrenia [4]. Specific symptom categories are shared across mood and anxiety disorders and the use of observational dimensional behavioural phenotypes that cut across diagnostic categories such as psychotic or anxiety symptoms may allow to identify new risk genes for psychiatric disorders [5]. In addition, intermediate phenotype or endophenotypes in mood and anxiety disorders may be a promising approach, as it is likely that the effect sizes for genetic associations with biological measures are greater than with more remote psychiatric diagnoses. Such phenotypes include but are not limited to neuroimaging, endocrine and neurophysiological measures [6]. In the future, these phenotypes could even include in vitro observations on neurons derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells from patient fibroblasts [7].","The published GWAS in mood disorders all highlight that a high number of common variants with small odd ratios likely cumulatively contribute to the risk to suffer from these disorders [8]. While this implies that very large samples will be needed to robustly detect these variants, it also indicates that true associations may not reach genome-wide significance [9]. This has spurred a number of re-analyses of GWAS for psychiatric disorders that explore whether functionally relevant genetic variants maybe be over-represented among the nominally significant associations and whether this overlap could highlight specific pathways relevant for the disease. To date, investigators have mostly focused on using expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis as well as methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis in different tissues to narrow in on putatively functionally relevant polymorphisms, i.e. variants associated with different gene expression or DNA methylation levels [10].In addition, combining genome-wide protein and gene expression datasets and studies in animal models of mood and anxiety disorders with human genetic studies may also help to identify relevant candidate genes from GWAS. For example, combining GWAS and gene expression studies for bipolar disorder, association signals appear to cluster in discrete regions of the protein–protein interaction network, showing replicated evidence for association for networks involving several interlinked signaling pathways, such as transmission of nerve impulse, Wnt and Notch signaling [11]. Such analyses highlight the importance of investigating such datasets not only on the single gene level but also on the level of functional pathways and new tools allow for stringent testing of the enrichment of signals in specific pathways [12]. Such pathway based analyses also allow better to integrate data from a number of different sources, such as gene expression and proteome datasets, GWAS, copy number variation or rare variant analyses that can highlight overlapping signals from different types of studies [13].","For schizophrenia and autism but also bipolar disorder it has become increasingly clear that rare variants in addition to common variants contribute to the risk of disease [14]. New technological developments, including next generation sequencing will allow us to study large numbers of patients for the presence of rare functional variants and data from re-sequencing effort of the complete RNA coding sequence (exome) are starting to be published [15]. However, these studies indicate that very large samples, with over 10,000 individuals will be required for sufficient power [16].","Finally, the environmental risk component is strong in mood and anxiety disorders, especially major depression. A number of candidate gene studies suggest that genes might moderate the effects of environmental risk factors in the absence of main genetic effects [17]. GWAS may profit from the inclusion of environmental exposure as a variable and this could unmask a number of important genetic moderator factors that are not apparent when combining cases and control with different exposure levels to risk environments. However, genome-wide gene x environment studies will require larger sample sizes and will have to deal with the problem of reliably quantifying environmental exposure in studies recruiting from different populations, especially when using retrospective measures. Here, the use of epigenetic investigations in peripheral blood cells may prove useful as biomarker for environmental exposure [18]."
