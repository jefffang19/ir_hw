0,"Investigation of genetic variants regulating the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor, subtype 5 (GRM5) mRNA in human brain","The metabotropic glutamate receptor, subtype 5 (GRM5) regulates cell excitability and neurotransmission and has been suggested to play a modifying role in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). The observation that GRM5 inhibitors ameliorate symptoms and slow the degradation of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in rodent models of PD suggests that low expression of GRM5 may also reduce symptoms in human patients and, possibly, slow the development of the disease. The goal of the present study is quantify common variation of GRM5 mRNA expression in human brain and identify haplotypes or combinations of genotypes that correlate with mRNA expression. Haplotypes and genotype combinations that predict mRNA expression should be useful as markers in genetic association studies aimed at detecting possible contributions of GRM5 to PD and other disorders.","Sixty-three independent frozen sections of prefrontal cortex (Han Chinese; Brodmann area 46) were obtained from the China Brain Bank Center (Wuhan). Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated using standard procedures. A common SNP, rs566277 (heterozygosity = 0.42), located within the 3’-untranslated region of GRM5 mRNA was chosen as a molecular marker to distinguish mRNAs derived from each autosomal allele. SNaPShot©-based AEI assays were carried out as previously described [Lim J et al., Molecular Psychiatry, 2007]. Analysis of population distributions of log2AEI ratios was carried out using a mathematical model developed in-house. Levels of GRM5 mRNA relative to mRNA encoding the house-keeping gene GAPDH were quantified using real-time PCR (calculated as ΔCt). Genomewide genotyping of samples was carried out using HumanOmni1-Qad arrays (Illumina). SNPs for which allelic heterozygosity and homozygosity correlate with AEI were identified by calculating Kappa coefficients for single-, double-, and triple- combinations of SNPs within a 500,000 base pair region of chromosome 11 centered on GRM5. SNPs with genotypes that correlate with GRM5 mRNA expression were identified by one-way ANOVA analysis for SNPs in same region.","Eleven of 18 samples heterozygous for the marker SNP showed robust differential expression between alleles. Mathematical modeling of the population distribution of log2AEI ratios suggested that GRM5 mRNA is regulated by two cis-acting genetic elements that are partially linked to the marker SNP (D’ = 0.24) and tightly linked with each other (D’ = 1.0). Three sets of tightly linked SNPs located in immediate the 5’-upstream region (rs7120151 + rs12421343 or rs4378401 or rs496939) were found to fit this model (r-squared ~ 0.9 for predicted vs experimentally determined log2AEI population distributions) and to be highly correlated with AEI (Kappa coefficient = 0.75 for rs7120151 + rs12421343 or rs4378401, and 0.5 for rs7120151 + rs496939). Correlations between genotype and relative GRM5 mRNA expression for rs7120151 and rs496939 just missed statistical significance (P = 0.05 – 0.057), but were statistically significant for the tightly linked SNPs rs655683 and rs7126679 (P = 0.035 and 0.03).","Our study suggests that expression of GMR5 mRNA is regulated by two tightly linked genetic elements located within a 77 kb region centered on the exon 1 and the promoter region. SNPs that highly correlate with AEI and mRNA expression should provide useful markers in genetic association studies aimed at evaluating the potential role of GRM5 as a genetic modifier of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including PD."
1,"Clinical, epidemiological, genetic, and electrophysiological characteristics of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathies in Israel","Only a few patients and families with transthyretin associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) have been described by different authors in Israel. The objective of this study was to elucidate the natural history, clinical manifestations, electrophysiological features, ethnic origin and genetic findings of all the known patients with TTR-FAP in Israel.","We reviewed the medical records of all the patients that have been reported and those who have not yet been described. We retrospectively assessed the major clinical, laboratory and genetic findings of the patients.","Seventeen patients were studied. All were Jews. Eleven were of Yemenite descent, harboring the ser77tyr mutation. Of these, seven belonged to a large 3-generation family, and each of the other four to different unrelated families. Three patients were Ashkenazi; one carried the val30met mutation, another the phe33leu mutation, and the third had two mutations on one allele: phe33Ile and gly6ser. Two patients were of Iranian origin showing val32ala mutation, and one of Tunisian origin showing the val30met mutation. Onset in most patients was in the sixth decade, presenting with sensory loss of the lower and upper limbs. About half of the patients experienced at onset pain, autonomic nervous system manifestations and demonstrated evidence of amyloid cardiomyopathy. One patient of Yemenite descent presented with amyloid cardiomyopathy without neuropathic features. Nerve conduction studies showed sensorimotor axonal neuropathy in all. Sural nerve biopsies were obtained in eight patients; two biopsies did not reveal amyloid deposit. The average course was rapid, and most patients died within 4-7 years. The cause of death was intestinal malabsorption and cardiomyopathy. Two patients of Yemenite origin underwent liver transplantation, which slowed down the disease progression.",TTR-FAP exists in the Israeli population and is disproportionately common among Yemenite Jews. The worldwide common mutation val30met is rare. The presence of other mutations may explain the relatively rapid course of the disease in the Israeli patients.
2,Genetic modulation of soluble Aβ rescues cognitive and synaptic impairment in a mouse model of AD,"There has been a longstanding debate on whether amyloid plaques are pathogenic by causing physical damage to surrounding tissue or protective by sequestering more toxic soluble forms of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. Numerous studies in mouse models have documented a complex relationship between soluble Aβ, deposited aggregates, and cognitive decline, but few experimental systems have been capable of dissecting how each form of the peptide contributes to the progressive memory deficits of Alzheimer’s disease. Here we use a controllable transgenic model expressing a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to distinguish the impact of APP and soluble Aβ from that of deposited amyloid on cognitive function and synaptic structure.","We created a transgenic model in which the tetracycline transactivator drives expression of APPswe/ind in neurons throughout the forebrain. After 6 months of transgene expression when amyloid burden reached approximately 10%, we placed half of the mice on doxycycline to suppress further production of transgenic APP and human Aβ. All animals were then tested for cognitive function using the Morris water maze, radial arm water maze, and fear conditioning. Once testing was complete, we harvested the mice to examine amyloid pathology, synapse density, oligomeric Aβ, and synaptic protein levels.","Doxycycline treatment suppressed expression of transgenic APP by > 90% and diminished production of human Aβ by 70% while leaving pre-existing amyloid deposits intact. Remarkably, this treatment restored cognitive performance to the level of healthy controls in all of the behavioral tasks examined. Cognitive improvement coincided with reduced levels of synaptotoxic Aβ oligomers, greater synaptic density surrounding amyloid plaques, and increased expression of pre- and post-synaptic markers. To demonstrate that recovery was due to reduction of Aβ and not simply suppression of APP, we treated a second cohort of mice with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY411575 and observed similar although somewhat less complete recovery in both Morris water maze and synaptic markers. Finally, transgene suppression normalized activation of the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin in a PAK-independent manner, suggesting that APP/oAβ may alter synaptic structure through the opposing Rho/ROCK pathway.",These findings indicate that transient forms of APP and Aβ underlie much of the behavioral and synaptic recovery observed in this model. Our work further suggests that residual amyloid deposits need not be removed for successful intervention at this early stage of disease.
3,New genetic links in eosinophilic esophagitis,"Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases are increasingly recognized and diagnosed disorders that include eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis and eosinophilic colitis. Among the eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, EoE has become increasingly prevalent in the United States, Switzerland and Australia [1]. Overall, EoE is a global health condition now reported on all continents except Africa, with an incidence of approximately 5 in 10,000 [1, 2].The diagnosis of EoE is based on clinicopathology and depends in part on demonstration of esophageal eosinophilia. A panel of experts proposed consensus recommendations in 2007 [1], which included the demonstration of 15 or more eosinophils in at least one high-powered field despite treatment with a proton pump inhibitor or exclusion of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by ambulatory pH monitoring. The clinical presentation of EoE varies with age: infants and toddlers often have difficulty feeding and fail to thrive, school-age children present with vomiting and epigastric or chest pain, and adolescents and adults present with dysphagia and food impaction [3].EoE is considered a food-allergy-related disorder on the basis of several findings. Most patients are atopic individuals (that is, they have a high rate of food allergen sensitization as determined using skin prick and patch testing); in addition, EoE patients have a higher rate of food anaphylaxis than the general population [4]. Moreover, nearly all EoE patients have complete remission following introduction of an elemental formula diet that removes all allergens from the diet; conversely, the disease flares on reintroduction of specific foods [3]. Unlike classic anaphylaxis that typically involves a limited set of foods, EoE patients are often sensitized to a myriad of foods, often including food groups not typically considered to elicit anaphylaxis [4].","EoE seems to be similar to many other allergic diseases with a mechanism of disease mediated by T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Experimental mouse models have demonstrated key roles for adaptive immunity, Th2 cell cytokines (especially interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13) and eosinophilic-attraction chemokines such as CCL26 (also called eotaxin-3) in the development of EoE, and also a strong connection between allergic sensitization and inflammation in the respiratory tract and skin [5, 6]. IL-13 has been shown to induce many of the features of EoE in human tissue and murine systems, including the induction of CCL-26 [7]. Genome-wide profiling revealed that CCL-26 is overexpressed about 50-fold compared with normal controls or patients with GERD [6]. In addition, Rothenberg and colleagues [6] found that the EoE transcriptome was consistent across sex, age and familial or non-familial inheritance patterns and was independent of atopic status, suggesting a common disease mechanism despite phenotypic variations. A potential proposed mechanism is that Th2 cell activation leads to overexpression of CCL-26 and thereby to migration of eosinophils to the esophagus.Work by Aceves and colleagues [8] showed that eosinophilic migration and activation in EoE lead to subepithelial fibrosis and to increased expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and its downstream signaling molecule phospho-SMAD2/3 compared with patients with GERD and healthy controls. In addition, esophageal biopsies demonstrated an increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) [8]. This fibrosis may account for the esophageal dysmotility that leads to the symptoms of dysphagia and food impaction observed in adults. The chronic fibrosis and changes in inflammatory markers also parallel symptoms observed in asthma.","The evidence indicates that EoE has a strong familial association, with nearly 10% of parents of EoE patients having a history of esophageal strictures and about 8% having biopsy-proven EoE [5]. EoE also shows a high sibling risk ratio (λS) of approximately 80 compared with related atopic diseases such as asthma (λS about 2) [9]. The first candidate gene for EoE identified was CCL-26, the most overexpressed gene in the esophagus as determined by genome-wide expression profiling [6]. However, the disease-associated allele is present in only 14% of EoE patients [6].Rather than looking at the potential pathways, Aceves and colleagues [10] examined response to topical corticosteroids - a standard therapy for the condition - in patients with EoE. A positive response was defined as residual eosinophil counts of seven or fewer eosinophils per high-power field. Responders had a reduced esophageal remodeling with decreased fibrosis, fewer TGF-β- and pSmad2/3-positive cells and decreased vascular activation following therapy with the corticosteroid budesonide. Responders were more likely to have a CC genotype at the -509 position in the TGF-β promoter than were non-responders.More recently, a multi-center genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene, at 5q22, as an important candidate gene in the pathogenesis of the disease [11]. TSLP is an epithelial-derived cytokine that activates professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, which initiate Th2-type allergic responses [12]. The same study also found an increased expression of TSLP in the esophagi of patients with EoE compared with healthy controls [11].The most recent finding by Sherrill et al. [13] adds to our understanding of the interaction of TSLP and EoE. This genomic analysis [13] focused on key allergic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along with epithelial SNPs and compared them in atopic and healthy controls. In addition to replicating the significant association between SNPs at TSLP and EoE, they found that TSLP variants remained significant when compared with atopic controls in their study [13] or asthma controls from the previous GWAS analysis [11]. However, variations in the TSLP gene were not significant when compared with controls, probably because of the small number of controls used. TSLP has also been found to be associated with atopic dermatitis [14] and asthma [15] compared with healthy controls. The finding of TSLP being significant only among the atopic controls could be due either to the other studies not removing patients with EoE (which is commonly atopic) from their control group or to the possibility that TSLP might trigger multiple atopic diseases depending on secondary signals.Sherrill and colleagues [13] also found a SNP in the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) gene that was associated with EoE. The gene encoding the TSLP receptor is located on the pseudoautosomal region on Xp22.3 and Yp11.3 and it was significantly associated with disease only in male patients with EoE. Given that EoE is more common among males by a 2:1 ratio [1], the finding of a SNP in the TSLPR suggests a potential mechanism for the male dominance observed in EoE. Sherrill et al. [13] also noted one additional finding that may suggest alternative pathways for the treatment or the pathogenesis of EoE: they observed that stimulation of primary esophageal epithelial cells with poly I:C (a double-stranded RNA mimetic) induced the expression of TSLP mRNA. This induction was dependent on Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation. TLR-3 recognizes double-stranded RNA, which is found in some viruses such as reoviruses. These results suggest a second hit for the development of EoE with a viral trigger and allergen exposure. In the lung and skin TSLP is produced primarily by epithelial cells in response to Th2 cytokines or TLR3 agonists, and it subsequently targets dendritic cells to secrete Th2-inducing activity, including Th2 cytokine and chemokine production.These findings [13] suggest a unique potential mechanism for the induction of EoE. Could food allergens trigger the TLR-3 receptor, inducing TSLP and causing the activation of the Th2 pathway, leading to eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus? Or is there a 'second hit', a virus that makes susceptible people develop EoE?","The current treatment options for EoE involve the avoidance of the trigger (foods) and the treatment of the underlying inflammation with topical corticosteroids [1]. Treatment with food avoidance is highly successful, with rates close to 100% with elemental diets (amino acid formulas) [1]. However, these formulas are unpalatable and lead to low quality of life. Eliminating foods on the basis of allergy testing or empirical elimination leads to resolution of esophageal eosinophilia in 50 to 80% of patients, depending on the diet and the age of the patient and reduction of symptoms in over 90% of the patients [3]. These diets are also difficult to maintain and many patients refuse to continue them. Treatment with topical steroids can work for 50 to 80% of patients, but there are also some drawbacks. Topical corticosteroids can lead to localized yeast infections and have potential long-term side effects, including growth suppression and osteopenia (low bone density); however, these have not been studied or seen in short-term studies. Other treatments currently being investigated include anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-13 and chemoattractant homologous receptor expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) antagonist or topical corticosteroids [16–18].The recent identification of TSLP and its receptor as key components in the EoE pathogenesis [13] suggests that blockage of the TSLP-TSLP receptor activation could provide an attractive approach to treating the cause of EoE. In addition, the new finding that TLR-3 induces TSLP suggests that a second hit (a virus) may trigger this pathway. If a particular virus or microorganism unique for EoE were identified, this would allow the development of a preventive strategy. This is unlikely to occur in the near future, but treatment with TLR-3 antagonists or blocking downstream signaling already represent hope for the treatment of EoE."
4,Towards an understanding of genetic predisposition to migraine,"The recent boom in genome-wide association (GWA) studies has resulted in a vast expansion of our knowledge of common variants influencing human diseases. So far, 1,888 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations have been reported, 1,435 of which are unique to the SNP [1]. Neurological diseases are underrepresented among successful GWA study findings. They account for only 36 publications, reporting 63 unique SNPs, out of a total of 812 publications and 3,942 unique SNPs [1]. If we exclude the APOE locus and the HLA region of chromosome 6p21 (which are associated with multiple diseases), the number of unique significant neurological loci found drops to 42.A probable explanation for the underrepresentation is the cost and difficulty of obtaining large sample sets; for anthropomorphic traits such as height and readily quantifiable measures such as blood lipids, sample sizes of up to 100,000 have been analyzed in widely successful GWA studies. A further complication in neurological diseases is the complexity of phenotyping brain phenotypes (description-based only, as in migraine), and the myriad diagnostic divisions (as in epilepsy), which together make collecting sufficiently large samples of any given subtype a hard task. Estimates from several diseases suggest that sample sizes exceeding 10,000 are required to reach sufficient statistical power to detect new loci [2].","The recent publication of the large-scale GWA study by the International Headache Genetics Consortium [3] in Nature Genetics was the first GWA study reported for a headache disorder. As the primary finding, it reported the first genome-wide significant association in the group of paroxysmal neurological diseases, which comprises epilepsy, migraine, episodic ataxia and various cerebrovascular and sleep disorders. In this study [3], a total of 5,933 cases and 50,809 controls were used to establish a single significant locus. The discovery sample consisted of 2,731 migraine cases collected from four European headache centers located in three countries. The initial finding was replicated in 3,202 cases and 40,062 independent controls from four European countries. Using RNA expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines, the identified variant rs1835740 was found to be an expression quantitative locus (eQTL) affecting glutamate metabolism. As glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), the eQTL finding provides a promising link between the genetic association and function. The eQTL data suggest that the predisposing allele of rs1835740 stimulates the expression of metadherin (MTDH, also called astrocyte elevated gene-1, AEG-1), which downregulates excitatory amino-acid transporter 2 (EAAT2, also called glutamate transporter 1, GLT-1), the main glutamate transporter in the brain. This finding stimulates the hypothesis that accumulation of glutamate, a potent neurotransmitter, in the synaptic cleft might contribute to the occurrence of the migraine attack.A problem in uncovering the genetic component of migraine has been the dearth of unambiguous results. After the early encouraging findings of the mutations causing the rare Mendelian forms of migraine (familial hemiplegic migraine, FHM) and the loci identified in the first linkage scan for common migraine [4], progress has been slow. The genes identified in FHM, similar to the corresponding findings for epilepsy, pinpointed ion channel defects, grouping these diseases into channelopathies. However, neither targeted ion channel association studies [5] nor the first GWA studies have provided evidence of the involvement of common variants in ion channel genes in common forms of migraine or epilepsy [3, 6]. Candidate gene studies covering obvious targets (the ion channels and the estrogen system) and up to 1,000 migraine cases and controls turned up conflicting results at best [4]. Although a number of loci using family-based linkage studies were identified, no genes for the common forms were found. Thus, the genetic and functional link between FHM and common forms of migraine remained unclear.Interestingly, the GWA association and the eQTL data point to the same synaptic transmission mechanism (the imbalance in glutamate release and its clearance from the synaptic cleft) that has been shown to be a key component of FHM pathogenesis in migraine with aura (Figure 1), although through a more peripheral part of the pathway in the latter [3]. Although this provides a potential link between FHM and common migraine pathophysiology, it should be noted that because of the ascertainment of the GWA study cases from tertiary headache clinics, it is not possible to estimate the effect of the identified variant on a population level from the current data. What we can conclude is that among patients whose migraine is severe enough to need tertiary care, this variant is significantly overrepresented. Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding the EAAT1 transporter also result in an episodic disease phenotype [7]. The diversity of pathways resulting in similar synaptic events might reflect one of the challenges we might encounter in dissecting the genetic predisposition of paroxysmal CNS disorders.Figure 1Localization and effect of a variant identified in the recent genome-wide association study of migraine in synaptic transmission, together with the previously known mutations in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM: genes are FHM1, CACNA1A ; FHM2, ATP1A2 ; FHM3, SCN1A ). The asterisk indicates the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2/GLT-1) recently linked to migraine. Glu, glutamate; FHM1-3, products of genes reported for familial hemiplegic migraine; mGluR, metabolic glutamate receptor. Black dots indicate the accumulation of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the synaptic cleft.Full size image","The obvious next steps for GWA studies are to address different migraine subtypes (such as migraine without aura) and from different recruitment settings (such as population-based, instead of clinic based migraine cases). As mentioned above, many neurological diseases lack such easily quantifiable phenotypes as serum lipid or blood sugar levels that are available elsewhere. The lack of quantitative phenotypes is also reflected in dissecting the umbrella diagnosis into subphenotypes, as they may similarly be based on non-objective measures. Thus, there is a chance that clinical subtypes might be of limited help and traditional diagnostic boundaries might not correlate with identified susceptibility genes. Although data are limited, there is emerging evidence that susceptibility loci can cross diagnostic boundaries and be associated with multiple traits, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [8]. There are similar overlaps with many autoimmune diseases and immunologically mediated traits [9]. There is evidence that the same locus or even same variant can contribute to the susceptibility of different disease outcomes.A case in point is that in another major paroxysmal CNS disorder, epilepsy, there is a long tradition of rigorous clinical subgrouping. If secondary factors contribute to the precise form of the disease, such strong divisions might distort from the ultimate goal of identification of the biological basis of seizure susceptibility, as was discussed in a recent editorial [10]. In the case of migraine, the diagnostic classification is perhaps more dynamic than for epilepsies. The classification recognizes that most patients suffer from various different forms of attacks, such as a combination of migraine attacks with and without aura. A migraine patient may, over the course of decades, pass through different types of migraine. Diagnostic flexibility accounts better for the varying severity spectrum both between patients and along a timeline. Although this flexibility does not abolish the phenotyping challenges, it is likely to be helpful in large GWA meta-analyses. When subsequent migraine association studies have identified more loci and we start to tackle their interplay in disease susceptibility, this might provide us with new tools for disease classification.It should perhaps not be surprising that a highly adaptable system such as the brain, with its myriad, cross-compensating pathways, can react with a very limited set of overt phenotypes, such as headache, to a variety of biological challenges. Therefore, summing over all possible symptom backgrounds in a large-scale GWA study is likely to result in only small odds ratios and thus sample sizes exceeding 10,000 may well be necessary. These large samples should also allow secondary analyses addressing questions related to disease subclassification and co-morbidity.","The first genetic link to common forms of migraine was recently reported, pointing the way towards alterations in glutamate homeostasis. This finding is the first step to uncovering the genetic background. Upcoming larger migraine GWA studies, across different ascertainment schemes, are likely to identify more genes and cellular pathways contributing to migraine susceptibility and will hopefully also shed light on the potentially different genetic background of different migraine subtypes. The emerging wealth of GWA data from other neurological and neuropsychiatric traits will also provide an opportunity to study whether some loci or pathways contribute to the susceptibility of co-morbid traits and whether genetic data will cross traditional diagnostic boundaries. However, it is evident that not all of genetic predisposition is explained by common variants, and future exome and whole-genome sequencing studies in large datasets will probably identify contributing highly penetrant low-frequency variants and expand our knowledge of the migraine susceptibility landscape."
5,GWASs and the age of human as the model organism for autoimmune genetic research,"In general, 'common' variants are those present at a frequency of over 1% in any one continental population (such as Europeans, Asians and Africans), whereas 'rare' variants are those present at a frequency of less than 1% in these populations [17]. This simple categorical distinction has been made in order to frame the genetic approach to discovering and testing DNA variants for their role in disease. For common variants, it is possible to screen a reference population to identify a catalog of variants (the discovery phase), and then test these variants in case-control collections using high-throughput genotyping technologies (the testing phase). A variety of resources have been developed to catalog common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including the International HapMap Project [17, 18]. More recently, data from the 1000 Genomes Project [19] have begun to be used to catalog variants in the 1% frequency range.In order to test whether these common SNPs are associated with risk of disease, commercial 'SNP chips' or arrays have been developed that capture most, although not all, common variation in the genome. These genotyping arrays can genotype hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a single experiment, at a cost of several hundred US dollars per sample. Contemporary GWASs use these arrays to measure the frequency of alleles in cases compared with controls. If the difference in allele frequency reaches a stringent level of statistical significance that corrects for the fact that there are about 1,000,000 independent common SNPs in the human genome (this significance level is about P < 5 × 10-8), then the allele is said to be 'associated' with disease.There are approximately 10 million common SNPs in the human genome. A fundamental challenge in human genetics is to systematically test each of these 10 million common SNPs for its role in disease. Contemporary GWASs test several hundred thousand SNPs across the entire human genome, most of which are common (minor allele frequency over 5%) in the general, healthy population. To test the remaining over 9 million common SNPs, the GWAS approach relies on the correlation structure of nearby SNPs. That is, nine out of ten SNPs are highly correlated, and testing one SNP serves to tag the remaining nine nearby SNPs. This concept is known as linkage disequilibrium (LD).The underlying rationale for the GWAS approach is rooted firmly in population genetics, as most of the differences between any two chromosomes are due to common SNPs [20]. On the basis of the hypothesis that disease alleles reflect the allelic spectrum of diseases in the general population, the risk of common diseases will be attributable in part to allelic variants that are also common.GWASs have discovered about 150 loci that harbor SNPs associated with risk of autoimmune diseases. Several of the earliest GWASs that successfully identified common risk alleles were done in autoimmune diseases. Crohn's disease is an illustrative example. Before GWASs, only two loci outside the MHC were known to be associated with Crohn's disease risk [21]. In 2006, a GWAS of about 1,000 case-control samples identified a coding variant in the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) gene locus [22]. The landmark Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWAS, published in 2007, included three autoimmune diseases (of the seven diseases studied): Crohn's disease, T1D and RA [23]. Since these initial GWASs, over 30 Crohn's disease risk loci [7], over 40 T1D risk loci [6] and over 25 RA risk loci have been discovered [24].From these GWASs, an important theme has emerged: the overlap among the loci that confer risk of autoimmune disease. In 2008, Smyth and colleagues [9] studied the overlap between celiac disease and T1D. The study [9] found that nearly half of the about 30 risk loci contributed to both diseases, whereas the others seemed to be disease-specific. Other studies have compared and contrasted risk confirmed alleles for a variety of autoimmune diseases [9, 25–27]. There is clear overlap for many of the known risk alleles, consistent with epidemiological data of disease clustering within families [28]. A partial list of loci associated with multiple autoimmune diseases is shown in Table 1.Table 1 Loci associated with multiple autoimmune diseasesFull size table","Although the number of loci associated with autoimmune disease is impressive, these loci cannot explain a sizeable fraction of disease risk. In fact, outside the MHC, common alleles can only explain 5 to 10% of disease risk associated with autoimmune disease. Considering that family studies have shown that more than 50% of autoimmune disease risk is thought to be genetic, the question arises as to why so much of the heritability is apparently unexplained by initial GWAS findings. One of the most frequently cited explanations for 'missing heritability' is that rare SNPs contribute substantially to disease risk, and contemporary GWAS arrays do not adequately capture rare variants [16].There are two ways to test rare variants systematically for association with disease. First, it is possible to catalog low-frequency variants - those variants present in approximately 0.5 to 5% of control chromosomes - in a manner analogous to common variants. The only difference is that a greater number of subjects need to be included in the discovery effort. This is the main premise behind the 1000 Genomes Project [19]. Once discovered and catalogued, these low-frequency variants could be genotyped in a high-throughput manner using genotyping arrays.The second approach is to couple the discovery and testing phases into a single experiment. That is, direct sequencing is done in case-control collections themselves, generating an unbiased catalog of DNA variants that are then tested for association with disease.Until recently, direct sequencing in large patient samples was cost prohibitive. Next-generation sequencing has been developed to sequence large regions of DNA - with the ultimate goal of sequencing the complete genome - in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner. In the near future, next-generation sequencing will probably be the technical method of choice for conducting GWASs.","An important promise of human genetics is that GWASs offer an unbiased approach to discovering new pathways that cause disease. Towards this end, a major challenge is to take the expanding list of disease risk alleles and understand the effect on gene function. The first step is to identify which gene near the associated SNP has its function affected by the underlying causal mutation (which is rarely known). This step is critical, as the region of LD surrounding the associated SNP often contains more than one gene (although often there is one likely candidate gene from the known biology). A region of LD includes neighboring sequence in which a group of SNPs are highly correlated (for example, at a correlation coefficient of r2 > 0.80). Moreover, it is conceivable that the causal mutation exerts its effect at a distance (for example, by altering gene expression) or that the causal mutation is rare in the general population and located some distance from the associated SNP [29].As shown in Figure 1, there are at least three general approaches to get from associated SNP to causal gene (and causal mutation). First, fine-mapping of the region of LD is performed using resequencing and dense genotyping. An allele is considered causal if it is predicted to alter function and if direct experimentation demonstrates altered function. An intriguing result from GWASs is that most associated SNPs lie outside coding regions, and most of the causal mutations probably also fall outside coding regions. It is likely that many causal mutations affect gene expression or mRNA splicing.Figure 1From associated SNP to causal gene/mutation. There are at least three ways to go from an associated SNP in a GWAS to the causal mutation(s) and causal gene. The first is to perform dense genotyping to identify the set of common SNPs that yield the strongest signal of association, followed by hypothesis-driven functional studies. The second is to perform deep re-sequencing to search for rare mutations that are independent of the common mutation and that alter protein function. The third is to use bioinformatics approaches to establish connections among genes across associated loci.Full size imageOne of the best examples was fine-mapping and functional studies of IRF5, a gene associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases [30, 31]. IRF5 encodes a member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, a group of transcription factors with diverse roles, including virus-mediated activation of interferon and modulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and immune system activity. Studies have revealed three functional alleles of IRF5: an exon 1 splice site variant, a 30-bp in-frame insertion/deletion variant of exon 6, and a variant in a conserved poly(A)+ signal sequence that alters the length of the 3' untranslated region and stability of IRF5 mRNAs [30]. Haplotypes of these three variants define at least three distinct levels of risk to SLE. There is an approximately twofold increase in the level of risk between carriers of the highest and lowest risk haplotypes.Second, candidate genes from a region of LD can be resequenced to search for independent, rare protein-coding mutations. The underlying hypothesis is that a true causal gene will harbor multiple risk alleles; at least one of these might be common (and identified by GWAS), whereas many others will be rare. Precedence for this hypothesis comes from studies of Mendelian disorders, for which disease can be caused by many different mutations to the same gene (genetic heterogeneity). In a study published in 2009 [32], the coding exons of six genes identified by GWASs of T1D were resequenced to search for independent rare mutations. Two rare SNPs in the interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1) gene were identified that conferred protection from T1D. IFIH1 is a cytoplasmic protein that recognizes RNA of certain viruses and mediates immune activation. Following infection, the IFIH1 protein senses the presence of viral RNA in the cytoplasm, triggers activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and IRF pathways and induces antiviral IFN-β response. The non-synonymous SNP with the strongest association, rs35667974 (which causes the amino acid substitution Ile923Val), was observed on an estimated 3 out of 960 case chromosomes but 24 out of 960 control chromosomes (P = 0.00004); another SNP, rs35337543 (which affects a splice donor site), was observed on 7 case chromosomes and 23 control chromosomes (P = 0.005). Both SNPs were genotyped in more than 20,000 additional case-control samples: rs35667974 was present in about 1% of cases and 2% of controls (P = 2.1 × 10-16) and rs35337543 in 1% of cases versus 1.5% of controls (P = 1.4 × 10-4). Both mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function mutations, although why these mutations influence risk of T1D remains unknown.The third approach is less direct, but nonetheless very powerful, especially when there are many loci associated with risk of disease. The underlying hypothesis is that there are a limited number of biological pathways that are altered to confer risk of disease and that true causal genes will be restricted to those specific pathways. Examples of such pathways include known signaling pathways (such as the NF-κB pathway and risk of RA [33]) or catabolic pathways (such as autophagy and risk of Crohn's disease [20]). The challenge of this computational approach is to define categories of pathways, as our understanding of many biological processes is incomplete. One successful approach has been to use information contained in PubMed abstracts to establish connections between gene loci [34]. This approach has been used to identify putative causal genes for RA and celiac disease [5, 13]. In the RA study, three loci were identified that contained the genes CD28, CD2/CD58 and PRDM1, respectively [5]. Both CD2 and CD28 are co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of T cells. PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP-1) is a transcription factor that regulates terminal differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Once these connections are established among risk loci, direct experimentation is still required to prove the pathways are critical to disease.","Once the causal gene and causal mutation(s) have been identified, the next major challenge is to understand the underlying biological pathways that lead to autoimmune disease. New resources now make it possible to study the effects of mutations linked to autoimmune disease directly in relevant human tissue.Registries have now been established at academic medical centers to study the functional consequences of common genetic mutations in blood cells from healthy control subjects [35]. Human immune cells (such as B and T lymphocytes) are easily accessible through a simple blood draw. These immune cells are of direct relevance to pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, as indicated not only by recent genetic studies but also by previous studies in patients with autoimmune diseases [36]. Human immune cells derived from healthy control subjects have been used successfully to gain insight into function of common mutations at several autoimmune genes. A missense mutation in the PTPN22 gene is associated with several autoimmune diseases. PTPN22 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed in lymphoid tissues and implicated in T-cell activation [37]. Functional studies in T cells derived from healthy human participants have shown that the PTPN22 risk allele alters secretion of IL2 from T cells stimulated through the T-cell receptor [38]. Other autoimmune risk alleles have been studied in a similar manner: a common multiple sclerosis risk mutation at CD58 can explain about 40% of the variance of CD58 cell surface expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [39]; and a common T1D mutation in IL2RA alters IL2RA cell surface expression on CD4+ memory T cells [40].Another new approach is to generate iPS cells from patients who carry specific genetic mutations. First described in 2006 [41], several studies have shown that iPS cells can be derived from patients with with Mendelian disorders [42]. By definition, iPS cells are pluripotent and can be differentiated into any human cell type. Specific protocols are required to direct differentiation into a specific cell lineage. In the case of immune lineages, protocols have been developed to differentiate human embryonic stem (ES) cells into B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, and other immune lineages [43–50]. Because of the similarities between ES and iPS cells, differentiation protocols developed in ES cells should be applicable to differentiation of iPS cells into these same immune lineages.Whether iPS cells derived from patients with autoimmune disease will be useful for functional studies of human genetic mutations is a hypothesis that needs to be rigorously tested. Human iPS cells offer several theoretical advantages over primary human immune cells derived from healthy patients. First, although many immune lineages can be isolated from peripheral blood, many reside within lymph nodes and other privileged sites not accessible through the blood. Moreover, it is impractical to isolate more than a few immune lineages in the amount of blood drawn from a single individual at a single point in time. Second, in studies of primary human immune cells, it is important to investigate carriers and non-carriers of mutations on the same day to minimize technical variability. iPS cells have the theoretical advantage of repeated measurements under a set of controlled conditions. Finally, primary human cells have a limited lifespan in culture. As a consequence, it is difficult to manipulate primary cells with transfections and other cellular perturbations.Most genetic discoveries have concerned the risk of disease overall, rather than relevant subsets of disease; this applies not just to autoimmunity but also to other diseases. As a consequence, a new challenge is to correlate genotype with clinically relevant phenotypes, such as response to therapy and disease severity. For genotype-phenotype correlation studies, the major bottleneck is setting up large registries of patients with biospecimens for genomic studies and detailed clinical data. Traditional patient registries and clinical trials - the workhorse for sample collection over the past decades - are unlikely to achieve the size required to obtain thousands of autoimmune patient samples for these studies. New approaches - next-generation registries - will be required to break this bottleneck. In theory, it should be possible to collect data as part of routine patient care. Increased use of electronic medical records [51] and new approaches to mining clinical data from such records [52] is one exciting approach to expanding sample collections.Contemporary GWASs of common variants have identified approximately 150 loci that confer risk of common autoimmune diseases. Once the causal genes and causal mutations have been identified, the next challenges will be to understand the underlying biological pathways and to correlate genotype with clinically relevant phenotypes. New resources are now available to enable these translational immunology studies in humans. Over the next few years, great strides should be made towards accomplishing these ambitious yet attainable goals."
