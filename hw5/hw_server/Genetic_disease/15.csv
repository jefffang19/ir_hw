0,Assessing known chronic kidney disease associated genetic variants in Saudi Arabian populations,"Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) has been rising in prevalence globally in recent years with shifting demographics including an aging population, lifestyle changes associated with urbanization, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The morbidity and mortality costs of CKD on society are significant, and are projected to become an even larger healthcare burden [1, 2]. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), CKD is estimated to affect approximately 1.72 million Saudis [3], equating to approximately 6% of the population. Furthermore, in KSA there is a consistent annual increase in the rate of CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis after development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) [4]. In a 2010 KSA investigation only 7.1% of Saudis with CKD were aware of their disease status and such under- and late- diagnoses of CKD often results in poorer outcomes in such patients [3].A strong heritable component to CKD and its risk factors exists [5, 6], independent of its largest risk factors hypertension and T2D [7, 8]. Monogenic pediatric renal diseases, such as congenital and infantile nephrotic syndromes, appear significantly more common in KSA than in the western world [9]. Over the last decade, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be an invaluable tool for identifying common variants associated with complex human diseases with small to moderate effects in agnostic hypothesis free approaches [10]. The identified variants and genes can yield novel insights into disease pathogenesis. GWAS of European white populations examining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD have identified greater than 50 associated loci [5, 11,12,13,14]. Variants in Shroom Family Member 3 (SHROOM3) have been identified as a CKD susceptibility locus through GWAS. SHROOM3 is regulator of epithelial cellular arrangement and planar remodeling [15], which contributes to glomerular filtration barrier integrity [16]. One CKD-associated SHROOM3 variant, rs17319721, was shown to impact cis-expression and renal allograft fibrosis [17]. Polymorphisms in Myosin Heavy Chain 9 (MYH9) have also been shown to be associated with CKD risk in admixed non-diabetic nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [18, 19]. Genetic polymorphisms in Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 9 (SLC7A9), an amino acid transporter known to be expressed in renal proximal tubule cells, cause cystinuria [20], are associated with GFR [5, 21], and have been identified as a risk factor for CKD patients of European ancestry [12]. Variants in Cystatin C (CST3), have been also shown to impact altered eGFR and kidney disease [22].While ethnicity is thought to play a large role in CKD genetics, very few genotyping studies of CKD loci have been performed in Saudi patients to date. In this study, we genotyped eight SNPs in four genes which have been shown to be associated with CKD mainly in populations of European descent. Herein we present the allele frequencies of said SNPs in 160 Saudi CKD and 189 non-CKD subjects from KSA, and study associations with CKD. Additionally, we employed multivariate analyses to examine the utility of SNPs and CKD-related biomarkers in CKD risk progression.","Following research ethics approval from the University of Dammam Institutional Research Board (IRB), blood samples from 160 Saudi Arabian patients with CKD were collected in the outpatient Nephrology department at King Fahd University Hospital. All participants gave informed consent. To confirm disease associations, 189, ethnically-matched donors with no prior medical or family history of CKD were recruited for comparison to a healthy population. Informed consent for DNA analysis was obtained from all research participants under the supervision of the IRB.DNA was extracted from whole blood using QIAmp Blood DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Eight polymorphisms (SHROOM3: rs9992101, rs17319721; SLC7A9: rs4805834; MYH9: rs4821480, rs4821481, rs2032487, rs3752462; CST3: rs13038305) were genotyped using TaqMan® assays (ThermoFisher, USA). Call rates greater than 95% and assessment for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were established for quality control.Allele frequencies and genetic variant association with eGFR from European descent populations were obtained from the CKD genetics consortium (CKDGen) [13]. The CKDGen cohort is composed of including data from 67 studies and up to 133,814 participants in population-based and randomized control trials. The beta coefficients of the linear regression were corrected for age [2], sex, and population stratification in CKDGen. Kidney function was reported as sex- and age-adjusted log transformed eGFR (n = 133,814, overall mean = 87.12 ml/min/1.73 m2, standard deviation = 23.09), with 14% of participants having an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Vitamin D3 and Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were obtained using the RECIPE ClinRep® HPLC Complete Kit (RECIPE Chemicals, GmbH, Munich, Germany) and the Human FGF-23 ELISA assay kit (Millipore, USA) respectively. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphorus, serum calcium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin and urine protein were assessed using the Flex® reagent cartridge on Siemens Dimension RxL chemistry system (Siemens Healthcare, GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Based on clinical diagnostic criteria, patients were stratified by clinical comorbidities including Type 2 Diabetes (fasting glucose level ≥ 121 mg/dL) and Hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg).Clinical and demographic variables were assessed for correlation with CKD status by using 2-sided, unpaired student’s t-test, Mann Whitney and chi-square tests. Association testing and Multivariate logistic regression and AUC analyses were performed using an R Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics (https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/e_07.html).","The baseline characteristics of the study participants demonstrated are shown on Table 1. The median age of CKD patients and healthy donors were 47.7 years and 32.1 years, respectively, with a larger proportion of healthy donors being male (76.6% versus 53.1%, P < 5 × 10− 4). There were no significant differences in the BMI between cases and controls (mean of 27.7 and 27.9, respectively, P = 0.824). CKD cases included 64 patients with CKD stage 3, 20 patients with CKD stage 4, and 76 patients with CKD stage 5 (N = 160). Glomerulonephritis was present in 62 patients including 45 with lupus nephritis. Comorbidities in CKD patients included T2D (n = 57), hypertension (n = 37), coronary disease (n = 29), and congestive heart failure (n = 12). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients was 17 ml/min/1.73 m2 with a standard deviation of 25 ml/min/1.73 m2. As expected, there were significant differences between the Vitamin D3 and FGF23 levels in patients with CKD as compared to healthy donors (Fig. 1b), 22.3 ng/mL vs 28.9 ng/mL and 485.6 pg/mL vs 39.4 pg/mL (P < 5 × 10− 4), respectively. CKD patients were then stratified on the basis of one or more comorbid conditions, including hypertension and T2D, and with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, and evaluated for significant associations to biochemical laboratory test values. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) demonstrated significantly altered biochemical laboratory values compared to those with earlier stages of CKD (Fig. 1), although no significant differences in vitamin D3 or serum calcium levels were observed (data not shown). Comparatively, patients with T2D and hypertension had significantly higher creatinine and FGF23 values as compared to those patients with CKD but without said comorbidities.Table 1 Baseline characteristicsFull size tableFig. 1Significant associations in Saudi CKD patients were revealed in eight of ten measured biochemical analytes stratified across CKD, ESRD, Type 2 Diabetes, and hypertension. a One-way ANOVA analysis of clinical analytes were evaluated for statistical significance across measured CKD comorbidities. Serum calcium and vitamin D were not significant. b Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test of Vitamin D and FGF23 between healthy and CKD disease states. Significance is noted as follows: *P <  0.05, **P <  0.01, ***P <  0.001 and ****P <  0.0001 (one-way ANOVA)Full size imageGenotyping and quality controlled was performed in the 349 study participants of Saudi descent. All eight variants in the four tested genes were observed in appreciable frequencies in Saudis (see Table 2), along with those observed in CKDGen reference populations. Among the eight SNPs genotyped, rs4821480, a SNP mapping to the MYH9-APOL1 locus was most strongly associated with presence of CKD stage 3 or worse (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.22–2.36, P = 0.002). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between genotyped variants located in the same genes (r > 0.9). The direction of effects of the lead SNP from each gene were the same as those reported from the largest published cohort of European descent including 133,780 participants.Table 2 Prevalence and effect of CKD risk alleles in Saudi Arabians and CKDGenFull size tableA multivariate model was built using clinical demographic information including age and gender, which demonstrated notably correlation with CKD disease status (AUC =0.80). To further strengthen regression analysis, biochemical analyte values for FGF23 and Vitamin D3, and MYH9 SNPs, rs4821480 and rs4821481 were tested in their capacity to enhance regression score. While FGF23 plus vitamin D levels improved association values, the combinatory enhancement of both biochemical analytes and MYH9 rs4821480 and rs4821481 genotypes generated the greatest predicative capacity and served as the best statistical model (AUC = 0.93, 95% CI 0.90–0.95, P <  0.0001; Table 3). Using all ten of the above described biochemical analytes across patient populations stratified for end stage renal disease (ESRD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension (HTN) a number of significant findings were observed (Additional file 1: Table S1). Similarly, when stratifying patient population by CKD, T2D and hypertension status significant associations were found (Additional file 1: Table S2).Table 3 Multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate improvement in CKD stage classification provided by CKD risk allelesFull size table","We tested the prevalence and CKD risk associated with alleles identified in European populations in Saudi patients. All eight variants were present in Saudi populations at appreciable frequencies, and one variant in MYH9 was statistically significantly associated with CKD in our Saudi study population. While the remainder of alleles were not associated at statistically significant levels, our study is limited in power due to our relatively modest sample size. We did however demonstrate direction of effects that were concordant with previous reports from the larger CKDGen consortium. Genetic variants in MYH9 are associated with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, FSGS and HIV nephropathy, however whether the association is due to a functional variant in MYH9 or due to LD with nearby Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) remains a point of controversy [23]. Functional variants in APOL1 are found on two different G1 and G2 haplotypes that are common in African populations (10–25%), but not observed to date in other populations [24, 25]. The function of the G1 and G2 APOL1 haplotypes have been recapitulated in a recently produced transgenic mouse strain [26]. It remains possible that both MYH9 and APOL1 are important in CKD progression, and multiethnic populations and model organisms will play key roles in untangling their relationships with CKD.GWAS have predominantly been performed in participants of European descent, and discovery and replication cohorts in populations from around the world are needed to further enhance our understanding of complex genetic traits. The generally held belief is that a functional risk allele should exhibit the same direction of effect in all populations. However, the genetic variant tested is often not the responsible functional variant but simply associated with, termed in LD with, the truly responsible variant. As such, ethnic- and population-based differences in regional linkage disequilibrium can create associations with opposite directions of effect, especially if the genetic distance between the marker and the responsible variant is great. Moreover, as the effect is often small, genetic drift and random chance allows the minor allele frequency to vary greatly between populations, resulting in significant differences in the power to detect associations. Novel, or de novo, mutations may result in private mutations that are only found in specific populations. Disease prevalence can vary between populations, as observed with pediatric nephrotic syndromes in Saudis, which is likely a result of the prevalence of underlying genetic risk factors. Finally, differences in environment and genetic background produce the possibility of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.Over 50 loci have now been implicated in CKD progression [13] and a larger sample will be required to obtain adequate power to confidently test in Saudi populations, and overcome the multiple testing required as the number of known CKD loci grows. Large collaborative efforts such as the Saudi 100,000 genomes project [27] will facilitate larger aggregations of CKD risk loci in larger number of individuals which will greatly improve CKD risk stratification of individuals. When we combined variants in our most associated CKD locus with known CKD biochemical markers we observed a very significant AUC value (0.93). As better Saudi specific CKD genetic risk loci become available, along with more powerful CKD disease progression biomarkers, we may be able to prioritize which individuals may be suitable for interventions such as the renoprotective agents, Nisoldipine and Lisinopril. Indeed, specific targeting of specific modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and T2D, may ameliorate the majority of the CKD genetic risk loci in some subsets of individuals."
1,Genetic parts to a preventive medicine whole,"There is much debate surrounding the utility of genetic information in clinical practice and general health care. Although useful in the treatment of certain cancers [1] and in the identification of pathogenic mutations in idiopathic conditions [2], there is no consensus as to whether or how to use genetic information in individual health surveillance and routine preventive medicine. A recent article by Patel et al. [3] in Genome Medicine provides a general framework for integrating genetic information into a wellness and health maintenance program. In doing so it exposes four issues at the heart of this debate: first, concern that standard clinical assessments will be replaced by genetic information; second, lack of methods to assess risk; third, the lack of good visualization tools for graphically depicting disease risk; and fourth, insufficient knowledge on how to deal with variants that are not directly related to disease risk.","The authors [3] enrolled eight patients in the 'Center for Health Discovery and Well Being (CHDWB)' program at Emory University, USA. This program focuses on integrative approaches for health evaluation and maintenance and is an appropriate place to vet the use of genetic information in clinical practice. The patients were chosen from 500 participants in the CHDWB program on the basis of their clinical profiles. Four patients were at risk of metabolic disease according to traditional measures (such as high body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, high-density lipoprotein levels, and triglyceride levels) and depression scores that put them in an upper disease risk category relative to the total pool of CHDWB participants; the other four had profiles that put them in a lower disease risk category. The genomes of the eight individuals were sequenced using Illumina technology (about 36X coverage) and the genetic susceptibility score for a variety of conditions was computed for each individual using a simple likelihood-based risk (LR) model. Clinical measures such as blood pressure, triglyceride levels, basophil counts and the Beck depression inventory were assessed at the time of enrolment in the CHDWB program, 6 and 12 months after enrolment, and periodically after that.","Four issues plague the adoption of genetic information in routine clinical care, and Patel et al. [3] sought to tackle these. First, they had to overcome the misguided conception - often unknowingly perpetuated in the literature [4] - that genetic information will replace standard clinical assessments and practice. In fact, genetic information will complement the use of many standard clinical measures because of the nature of the information provided. Genetic information provides a static set of predictive biomarkers for disease susceptibility, whereas most clinical assays and instruments detect indicators that vary as a disease progresses. Information on temporally invariant genetic risks complements temporally variable clinical measures, as it helps to show whether a disease for which an individual has an inherent susceptibility has started to manifest itself or to subside. As an illustration, a study by Lyssenko et al. [5] found that genetic markers performed best when predicting long-term development of diabetes, whereas clinical laboratory assays (such as insulin and glucose levels) performed best when predicting its short-term development. This is consistent with the idea that widely used contemporary clinical assays probe the pathophysiological manifestations of a disease process that appear just before, during, or long after the onset of the disease. This is unlike risk assessments based on variants in inherited DNA sequence, which are fixed at birth.For the eight people evaluated by Patel et al. [3], the genetic risk profiles were 'concordant' (or consistent) with the clinical assay results in many instances and 'discordant' in others. For example, four individuals at low genetic risk for obesity also had low weight and BMI levels at the time of clinical evaluation; however, one individual with a very low genetic risk of hypertension did have high blood pressure and two individuals with an elevated genetic risk of diabetes had normal glucose and insulin levels at the time of their evaluations. The discordance between high genetic risk and the healthy clinical evaluation measures in some individuals suggests that these individuals were defying their genetic susceptibility to a disease, perhaps through disease-mitigating behaviors, pharmacologic interventions, or an unknown protective effect. The success of the CHDWB program will be demonstrated if it is shown to cause an even greater reduction in patients with manifestation of clinical disease than this. For genetic medicine as a whole, the brightest future would be if clinicians can steer patients to health despite elevations in their genetic risks (Figure 1).Figure 1Schematic of the links between genetic risk and longitudinal clinical assessments for disease surveillance and health maintenance. In this scenario, the probabilities of disease based on genetic variants are calculated at a point in time for as many different conditions as possible, preferably at birth to facilitate lifetime health maintenance. Disease risks deemed high (such as with a probability over 0.5, denoted by the black dotted line) are noted and immediately focused on. Clinical measures are then obtained periodically to monitor disease and inform the calculation of a posterior probability of a disease manifesting itself given an individual's genetic predisposition (depicted as lines emanating from each disease category). Risks above the threshold for intervention are noted (red parts of lines). The graph also depicts a hypothetical setting (dashed red line) in which risk for metabolic disease is high, clinical measures indicate increased risk and an intervention is not undertaken, leading to disease and ultimately death from that disease.Full size imageSecond, the authors [3] had to develop and implement a method to compute genetic risks, risks based on clinical examination, and integrated risks. The LR method they champion is appropriate but is ultimately dependent on summary information regarding variants associated with diseases arising from case/control-based genome-wide association studies, and not from prospective longitudinal studies [6, 7]. In the authors' defense, there are precious few longitudinal studies with which one could develop or vet genetic risk prediction models, although some are emerging [8]. The Bayesian updating method also used by Patel et al. in this article [3], in which genetic risk is modified according to the current clinical profile, is also appropriate, but again should be evaluated in prospective longitudinal studies. The reasons for this are two-fold. First, appropriate weighting of clinically defined risk (based on clinician assessment and clinical laboratory results) relative to genetic risk is not trivial to determine; that is, it is not clear whether an observable clinical manifestation of a disease is worth more to a clinician in terms of immediate intervention needs than a future risk as indicated by genetic susceptibility. Second, the interpretation of the integrated Bayesian posterior probability based on a recent clinical evaluation would be problematic without an appropriate reference set of probabilities; that is, without probabilities that have been calibrated or shown to be consistent with actual data, we cannot know what a reduction in risk probability based on clinical profile means in terms of ultimate prognosis and future risk. Again, without appropriate longitudinal data, it is hard to pursue such a calibration exercise, but it would make sense to test this in existing datasets, however flawed, for example in the Framingham Heart Study data. An additional vexing problem in calculating risks for multiple diseases is taking into account the fact that many disease manifestations are correlated (such as obesity and diabetes or heart disease). The authors [3] admitted that their approach made some unrealistic assumptions in this respect (such as independence of the diseases), and this is an area worthy of further research.The third important issue that the authors [3] had to consider is the best way to present and visualize the results of their disease risk assessments based on LR and Bayesian calculations for physicians and patients. Conveying these results must be intuitive and quick to interpret and must reflect not only multiple disease risks, but how genetic risks for these multiple diseases are modified by ongoing changes in clinical measures and evaluations. To address this the authors proposed three different graphical displays ('risk-o-grams' [6], 'gridiron plots', and 'radar plots'). Each display seeks to condense risks for multiple diseases by clustering them into broad categories such as 'immunologic' or 'metabolic', providing graphics that give a sense of how genetic risk is modified by changes in clinical measures. Although intuitive from a biomedical perspective and visually appealing, the merit of these graphical representations now requires feedback, if not overt, objective comparison among them as well as others, from clinicians, health practitioners and patients.Finally, the authors [3] made decisions about how to deal with genetic variant information that did not directly inform their disease risk calculations. They did not focus on rare variants associated with monogenic or other diseases, novel variants likely to be damaging or possibly deleterious, or pharmacogenetically meaningful variants. In addition, they did not consider variants of unknown significance, although this is an important area for the future. In this context, highly controversial 'incidental findings' (the existence of deleterious, disease-causing variants not germane to a particular condition of focus) may not be as problematic in a setting, such as general clinical preventive medicine, that involves the comprehensive assessment of genetically mediated disease risk and health prognosis for an individual patient, as it would be in another setting, such as a search for specific disease-causing variants like BRCA1 variants [9].","Other issues, such as costs, issues of privacy, the role of ancestry in mediating genetic risk, and, importantly, whether or not enough is known about the genetic basis of a particular disease to confidently categorize individuals as at risk, are only indirectly discussed by Patel et al. [3]. However, the approaches the authors describe are as good a set of starting points as any, and they have done a great service to the translational research community by exposing as many issues as they did. In addition, it is clear that genetic assay costs will continue to drop, greater emphasis will be placed on health information technology, and more insight into the global functional consequences of genomic variants will be obtained, paving the way for similar reports. In this light, we hope that the naysayers of the use of genetic information in general clinical practice will do with their overly critical attitude exactly what individuals genetically susceptible to the common cold hope to do when their first cold symptoms arise - just get over it."
2,Complex genetic diseases: controversy over the Croesus code,"Shakespeare is thought to have had a working vocabulary of some 35,000 words, about twice that of an educated person today. A play is therefore an apposite metaphor for the genome, in which the principal interest lies not in the words or letters but in the way it is performed and brought to life on the biological stage. The sequencing of the human genome provides a sense that human biology has reached a new beginning in which the genomic text can be read but it is far from clear how it is played out. Despite this, new horizons are being proclaimed, in which complex diseases are explained, new drugs delivered and new models created. But science and theology are never far apart and nowhere more so than in unravelling the genetics of complex disease - the Croesus code that will bring wealth to some and health to others. The theological differences lie in how to apply new information from the Human Genome Project and whether or not it is an illusion that whole genome association studies using dense maps of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in large patient populations will lead to new insights into common disease and to a safe, personalized medicine.","The key issues concern the genetic architecture of common diseases. On the one hand, Eric Lander (speaking at the Human Genome Organization's annual meeting, HGM2001, in Edinburgh, UK), along with David Reich and colleagues from MIT, has argued that the allelic diversity underlying disease is predictable and that it favors SNP mapping of large patient populations [1]. Four main factors account for this predictability. First, in human founder populations some 100,000 years ago, the effect of an allelic variant on reproductive fitness to a large extent determined its equilibrium frequency. An allele with a deleterious phenotype would reduce fitness and achieve a low equilibrium frequency, determined by a mutation-drift-selection balance [2]. An allele with little or no effect on fitness, as perhaps expected for genes influencing late-onset disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or heart disease, could achieve a high equilibrium frequency. The second factor is the relatively rapid expansion of anatomically modern humans from a small founder pool of a few tens of thousands to the present 6 billion [3]. The third factor is the expectation that the predicted allelic diversity for neutral or selectively equivalent alleles in such a small founder pool is remarkably low, in fact close to one or a few alleles per locus - given by (1 + 4Neμ), where Ne is the effective population size and μ the average mutation rate per locus per generation [4]. As the human population expanded, however, the allelic diversity increased enormously, at the rate of about 175 new mutations per genome per generation. In principle, it is possible for every base of the genome to be mutated in at least one person alive today. Most of this variation is destined to disappear rapidly, but many young alleles reached significant frequencies within human subpopulations, prior to recent urbanization [5].The fourth and key insight provided by Reich and Lander [1] is that if a disease-risk allele was common in the founder population, it takes a very long time before it is diluted out by the new alleles generated during population growth. Eventually, a new equilibrium will be reached, with a very high allelic diversity - in the tens of thousands of alleles per locus - but in some cases this may take over a million years. At present, this degree of diversity is only expected for alleles that were at low frequency in the founder population and so are more rapidly diluted out and equilibrated with younger alleles. Such a situation is already evident in the high allelic diversity of deleterious monogenic disorders. In short, if an allele was common in the distant past, it may well be common today and allelic diversity will be low. For example, the APOE*E4 allele that is associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease was such a founder allele and remains common, with an allele frequency of 0.04-0.49, in all human populations today. On the other hand, if an allele was rare in the founder population, it will now be a substantially rarer member of a diverse allelic set. In the case of susceptibility alleles for common diseases, which Reich and Lander [1] assume to be more-or-less invisible to natural selection, these may have reached high allele frequencies in the past, in which case they will remain at high frequency today. The common disease/common variant hypothesis [6] is thus both predictable from population genetic theory and supported by empirical data (Table 1a). From this perspective, it is a short step to whole-genome association mapping of such variants using dense SNP maps in large samples of patients and controls.Table 1 Summary of allelic heterogeneity in support of the common disease/common variant or multiallele/multilocus hypothesesFull size table","The common disease/common variant model is elegant, appealing and politically correct, but there are objections. The essential one is that it fundamentally misrepresents the nature of common disease. By definition, complex traits have what Kenneth Weiss and Joseph Terwilliger [7] call low ""detectance"" - a low probability of carrying any particular susceptibility genotype given that the individual has a particular disease or trait phenotype. This is because, unlike Mendelian disorders, common diseases clearly result from the interaction of many genetic and environmental influences, so that the correlation with any one factor is weak. There may be uncertainty about the extent of oligogenic versus polygenic influences on a trait, but few doubt that non-genetic factors play a major role in the common late-onset disorders of western societies, many of which have fluctuated in prevalence within the last 50-100 years (type 2 diabetes, obesity, auto-immune diseases, asthma, hypertension and coronary artery disease) [8]. Several of these disorders show a steep decline in heritability as age-of-onset rises, implicating generalized ageing processes that are not strongly influenced by genetic differences [8,9]. These diseases are common because of highly prevalent non-genetic influences, not because of common 'disease alleles' in the population. The majority of cases are not genetically determined to any meaningful extent. Such weakly disease-associated alleles as do exist can undoubtedly reach high frequencies if they are truly invisible to selection, but a key issue is the proportion of them that exert non-trivial influences on late-onset phenotypes. An inverse relationship between the magnitude of genetic effect and allele frequency was postulated many years ago [10,11], suggesting that few variants of clinical consequence will be common (Figure 1b). More recently, modeling of complex diseases by Jonathan Pritchard [12] predicts that neutral susceptibility alleles contribute little to the genetic variance underlying disease, since they tend to be either lost or close to fixation in the population. By contrast, alleles under weak selection may constitute the bulk of the genetic variance, especially at loci showing high mutation rates. This predicts extensive allelic heterogeneity underlying disease, although the collective frequency of these alleles may be quite high.Figure 1(a) Illustration of the common variant/common disease and multilocus/multiallele hypotheses (see text for details). Shaded symbols indicate carriers of a disease or trait; open symbols are non-carriers. (b) Inverse relationship between allele frequency and phenotypic effect, as postulated by Sewall Wright [10]. The arbitrary division between alleles with small (polygene), intermediate (oligogene) or large (major) effects is based on Morton [11]; λS, relative risk to sibs.Full size imageThe empirical observation that late-onset Mendelian-inheritance disorders, in which causal genes should also have failed to influence reproductive fitness, show broad allelic diversity contradicts the common disease/common variant hypothesis (Table 1b). An example is the diversity of rare disease-causing BRCA2 alleles (of which there are more than 400) compared with only one out of six common alleles that shows any effect on breast cancer risk (see Table 1; N372H relative risk 1.3) [13]. Similarly, premature coronary artery disease due to familial hypercholesterolaemia is caused by over 735 different alleles of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, but there are no common LDL receptor variants with significant clinical effects. Conversely, some deleterious alleles, such as the ΔF508 CFTR allele associated with cystic fibrosis, are at high population frequency (approximately 1.5% of Caucasian chromosomes). This allele appears to be of relatively recent origin (estimated at 3,000 years ago), explaining why it is found largely in northern Europeans [14].These and similar observations (Table 1) suggest, firstly, that genetic effects do not conveniently parcel themselves into early-onset versus late-onset, with corresponding effects that are either visible or invisible to selection: high allelic diversity is evident in many late-onset disorders, suggesting significant adverse selection and low allele frequencies in founder populations. It is commonplace for a gene to show both early and late patterns of expression, which may or may not overlap in time or space, some of which represent a trade-off between early advantageous and late deleterious effects (antagonistic pleiotropy), others early deleterious and later neutral or advantageous effects [15]. Variants with deleterious phenotypic consequences can also survive and reach high population frequencies if they confer a selective advantage at reduced dosage or during times of high mortality. Secondly, chance and population history are major determinants of extant patterns of variation.","The common disease/common variant hypothesis is not just an interesting idea to be discussed in ivory towers. The real opposition to it stems from its wide acceptance as justification for SNP mapping of complex disease and pharmacogenomic traits in large population samples [16,17,18]. It is acknowledged that these methods will rarely work unless the theory is substantially correct. Association mapping requires enrichment for a common ancestral predisposing (or protective) allele within groups sharing a common disease or drug-response trait [19]. Traditionally, trait mapping is achieved by the simple but powerful strategy of studying families with more than one member either exhibiting or correlated for the trait. The greater the familial correlation, the more likely that a large genetic effect is involved. This strategy, the mainstay of Mendelian mapping, increases the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the proportion of those studied whose trait results from non-genetic factors. Other strategies for increasing the detectance of a disease locus include ascertaining by extreme age-of-onset (for example, early-onset adult cancers or coronary artery disease); by studying those showing extreme values of a sub-clinical phenotype, which is genetically simpler than the disease itself (for example, plasma lipid profiles); by disease severity (for example, recurrent or bipolar depression); by studying a high prevalence ethnic group despite similar environmental exposure (for example, type 2 diabetes in Mexican Americans); by low environmental risk (for example obstructive lung disease in non-smokers, or coronary artery disease in rural Mediterraneans); by studying an isolated subpopulation (so that a small founder size minimizes the number of risk alleles entering the population); or by studying a clinical-aetiological subgroup (for example, HLA-matched type 1 diabetics) [20]. Generally, a combination of such strategies is required to minimize the background noise of non-genetic cases and to enrich for those with a common genetic susceptibility [7,20]. Weiss and Terwilliger [7] argue that such methods of ascertainment are crucial, providing the major buffer against low detectance and loading the dice in favor of the investigator. The odds are heavily stacked against gene mapping in complex disease. If locus or allelic heterogeneity is high, association studies of single affected individuals, especially if they show late onset, or studies of parent-child trios, are all inherently flawed."
3,Identification of common genetic modifiers of neurodegenerative diseases from an integrative analysis of diverse genetic screens in model organisms,"Despite major advances, debilitating neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases as exemplified by Huntington's disease (HD) and related ataxias afflict millions worldwide and remains a significant and unresolved burden facing ageing populations. Many genetic factors including specific causative mutations have been identified but therapies for these debilitating and eventually fatal disorders are lacking. These disorders are associated with the unifying theme of accumulation of toxic, misfolded protein aggregates or inclusion bodies followed by progressive neuronal dysfunction, eventual neuronal loss and death. In many cases the mutations in disease-specific proteins that lead to protein aggregation have been indentified and there is growing evidence that the cellular protein quality control systems are an underlying common denominator of these diseases [1]. In different individuals, the susceptibility to disease-related mutations and the time of onset of age-related neurodegeneration differ significantly suggesting the importance of additional genetic factors or genetic variation [2]. Despite this, relatively few genetic factors shared between neurodegenerative diseases have been identified so far.Knowledge of genetic regulators of neurodegeneration is important not only for an understanding of potential neuroprotective mechanisms but for the identification of potential new drug targets. The use of small model organisms with short generation times such as C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, has facilitated testing of hypotheses to illuminate a prospective cellular cause of protein-misfolding diseases like HD, PD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and AD or neuroprotective mechanisms against neurodegeneration [3, 4]. Disease models in these organisms have also allowed screening of potential genetic modifiers of the late-onset cellular and behavioural phenotypes. Screening can be performed by molecular, genetic and chemical manipulations of gene function, i.e. using mutagenesis (deletion libraries, transposon based insertion), transgenic overexpression of exogenous human misfolding disease-related proteins, or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown to determine the loss- or gain-of-function phenotypes. Previous studies have ranged from the examination of the effects of genetic manipulation of small number of targeted genes to whole genome screens. In addition, a wide range of disease models has been examined. For example in C. elegans, the most widely studied model organism in this context, multiple tissue-specific transgenic models manifesting pathological phenotypes that faithfully recapitulate many cellular and molecular pathologies of complex neurodegenerative disease processes have been used [5, 6]. These models have been based on muscular or neuronal expression of aggregation-prone proteins such as mutant tau, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), α-synuclein, polyQ constructs, Huntingtin fragment and toxic amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) [7], and has allowed identification of modifiers and cellular processes of α-synuclein inclusion formation [8, 9], polyQ [10] and mutant SOD1 aggregation [11], α-synuclein and polyQ-induced toxicity [12, 13] and tau-induced pathology [14]. The model organism approach and the various disease models that have been studied have been extensively reviewed in recent years and will not be described further here [5, 6, 15–20].It might be expected that common features should underlie the different pathways that lead to or protect from the phenotypes in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. One key question of interest, therefore, is the extent to which the model organism studies have identified common genetic regulators of neurodegenerative disease. While chaperone proteins involved in protein folding have emerged as common factors [1] it has appeared that relatively few overlapping genetic regulators have been identified from genetic screens using different models. For example the same group using a whole genome RNAi screen in C. elegans models of both polyQ and α-synuclein aggregation reported only a single gene overlap from a large number of hits identified [9, 10]. Use of RNAi screens in Drosophila cell lines with similar huntingtin polyQ models identified 21 [21] and 126 [22] regulators respectively. Only three of these identified regulators overlapped between the two studies. In addition, only two regulators from the Drosophila cell line studies overlapped with those found in an assay for polyQ aggregation in human cells [23] and had opposite effects. In another study, regulation of toxicity due to expression of either α-synuclein or a huntingtin fragment in yeast was found to involve non-overlapping sets of genes [24]. One problem in comparing across all screens is the different disease models that have, for example, used toxicity in all or only in specific neurons or alternatively protein aggregate formation in either neurons or muscle as the disease phenotype [5, 6, 17]. An initial analysis of different screens based on the biological function of identified genes did indicate the role of common and differing functional classes of modifier genes involved in various cellular process including regulation of protein homeostasis, vesicular traffic and transcriptional control [17]. A significant problem in understanding the commonality of genetic regulators is the need for careful matching of protein orthologues across the three model species and this has not been carried out systematically.We have set out to use data from published genetic screens in C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster to generate an integrated data set of genetic regulators of neurodegeneration. In order to do this we have used C. elegans as the reference point since this organism is most applicable for large scale screens and has been very widely used for study of neurodegenerative mechanisms. For C. elegans and D. melanogaster we have focussed on screens at the whole organism level as these have the additional possibility of identifying non-cell autonomous factors. The aim of this study was to give an improved indication of shared genetic factors and to provide a resource for future studies on neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.","A series of papers were collated in which genetic approaches were used to identify regulators of neurodegenerative models in S. cerevisiae and diverse whole organism models in C. elegans and D. melanogaster (Figure 1). As well as medium and large scale screens we also included examples of targeted small scale genetic studies of candidate genes to allow inclusion of other regulators. There are additional candidate gene studies or screens on cells lines from Drosophila for example [21, 22, 25] that have not been included. Data from the published literature was first used to compile a list of genes identified as regulators in various neurodegeneration models in C. elegans (Additional file 1). For studies in D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae, lists of the gene regulators was compiled and then the existence and identity of any C. elegans orthologues was examined for each genetic regulator using the Princeton Protein Orthology Database [26]. Confirmation of the existence of single or multiple potential orthologues generated lists of the C. elegans orthologues of genetic regulators of neurodegeneration from studies in D. melanogaster (Additional file 2) and S. cerevisiae (Additional file 3). From this analysis of a total of 950 identified genetic modifiers of neurodegeneration, 675 were found to have orthologues that could be identified in the C. elegans genome (Table 1). The genes that did not have identifiable orthologues in C. elegans are likely to be yeast- or fly-specific or simply not represented in the C. elegans genome.Figure 1Steps in the integrated analysis of genetic regulators identified from genetic approaches in model organisms.Full size imageTable 1 Genetic studies for the identification of regulators of neurodegeneration models in C.elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogasterFull size tableFrom the combined lists, a total of 624 distinct genes encoding genetic regulators were identified (Additional file 4). An initial analysis of the genetic modifiers based on cellular function was carried out. As described previously from this type of analysis [17] it could be seen that the genes covered a wide range of cellular functions covering 17 different classes of biological function (Figure 2). There was, however, a concentration of genes in certain functional classes. Genes involved in protein folding (e.g. heat shock proteins), protein degradation and autophagy were discovered across multiple disease models. Genes involved in transcriptional regulation were identified across all the polyQ and tau-disease models. It was noteworthy that the α-synuclein disease models produced a particular concentration of regulators functional in vesicular transport (e.g. rab-1) although these did appear, albeit less frequently, in studies on other disease models.Figure 2Functional profiling of genetic modifiers identified in diverse screens. Comparative analysis of modifiers identified in worm (Ce) models of polyQ, tau, SOD and α-synuclein aggregation, yeast (Sc) models of misfolded α-synuclein and Htt toxicity and fly (Dm) models of misfolded tau and polyQ toxicity from diverse screens reveals that the identified modifier genes function in a wide variety of biological processes as defined in the original studies. The blue filled box indicates that one or more genes in this category were identified. The number of the study indicated refers to the numbering in Table 1.Full size imageOf more interest was the potential identification of specific genes with overlapping modifying roles in different disease models and model organisms. Within the set of distinct C. elegans orthologues we found 34 that had been indentified in more than one study. These are shown in Table 2 and in an expanded version with additional information in Additional file 5. Significantly, all of these genes have human orthologues (Additional file 5). The overlapping regulators fell into several different functional classes (Table 3) based on their classification in the original studies.Table 2 Overlapping genetic regulators of neurodegeneration with orthologues in C.elegansFull size tableTable 3 Biological processes associated with the identified overlapping genetic regulators of neurodegeneration.Full size tableA recent study has extended the identification of suppressors of polyQ aggregation in C. elegans [10] by examining whether knock down of their human orthologues would suppress aggregation of mutant huntingtin in a human cell line. Of the 177 human orthologues, 26 inhibited aggregation in the HK293 cells supporting the idea that genetic regulators identified in C. elegans would have a conserved function relevant for a human model [23]. Three of the human suppressors correspond to the overlapping regulators in Table 2 (hsp-1, cct-4 and cct-5) and a fourth was an additional subunit of TCP-1 (cct-2).Many but not all of the overlapping genes in Table 2 are known to be expressed in adult neurons in C. elegans where they could, therefore, have a physiological role in regulating neurodegeneration. This is clearly an important consideration as some of the worm disease models are based on aggregate formation in muscle rather than neuronal cells. It should be noted that the data available in WormBase on the cellular expression of worm proteins is variable and so the question of neuronal expression is uncertain for some of the regulators. Two genes, bli-3 and phi-49 have, however, non-neuronal and restricted cell type expression. This may suggest that they may be unlikely to be physiological regulators of neurodegeneration in the worm but alternatively they could, for example, affect release of extracellular factors that act on neurons.The overlapping gene set included regulators identified in more than one study but only using the same or similar type of disease model in a single species (Table 2). Others, however, had been identified in multiple models and/or species. Amongst the latter were, unsurprisingly, members of families with functions related to protein folding such as hsp-1, hsf-1, dnj-13, cct-4, and cct-5 which have key roles in proteostasis [27]. In addition, three genes encoding enzymes involved in ubiquitination, chn-1, ubc-8, and let-70 were identified in more than one study. The mammalian orthologues, CHIP and Ube2D2 respectively, of chn-1 (an E3 ligase) and let-70 (E2 conjugating enzyme) are known to interact directly [28, 29] as are CHIP and p97 (cdc-48.1) [30]. Interestingly, CHIP also provides a further link between ubiquitination and protein folding pathways based on its known interactions with and ability to ubiquitinate Hsc70 and HSF1 (Figure 3). These data would put CHIP at a key point in two pathways that modify neurodegeneration. The idea that CHIP is a key player in the regulation of neurodegeneration is reinforced by the evidence that it has been shown to ubiquitinate α-synuclein [31] and ataxin-1 [32] and to stimulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of the PD gene product Parkin [33]. In addition, CHIP has a neuroprotective role in the neurotoxicity caused by over-expression of ataxin-1 in a fly model [32]. Taken together with the screens included here [14, 34] in which CHIP orthologues were found to modify neurodegeneration models including those based on tau-induced pathology, polyQ-related disorders and α-synuclein over-expression, it appears that CHIP could play a key protective role in multiple neurodegenerative diseases.Figure 3The diagram shows known binary protein-protein interactions between the molecular chaperone and ubiquitin-related overlapping regulators in Table 2. The interactions are included if they were identified between orthologues of the proteins from any species and are shown labelled with the names of the human orthologues with those involved in protein folding (chaperones) in blue and those in ubiquitin-related pathways in red. The human orthologues and their corresponding C. elegans orthologues are as follows: HSF1, hsf-1; Hsc70, hsp-1; DnaJB5, dnj-13; CHIP, chn-1; p97, cdc-48.1; Ube2D2, let-70.Full size imageAnother significant functional grouping in the shared modifiers is the three histone deacetylases, sir-2.1, hda-1 and sin-3 which were identified in both polyQ and α-synuclein disease models in flies and worms. The mammalian orthologues of hda-1 (human HDAC1) and sin3 (human SIN3B) interact directly and function as part of a protein complex to repress gene transcription [35, 36]. A selective study on histone deacetylases in C. elegans showed opposing effects of different deacetylases but loss of either hda-1 or sir-2.1 exacerbated neurodegeneration due to polyQ toxicity [37]. Overexpression of sir-2.1 had been suggested to increase longevity in C. elegans [38] leading to widespread study of the potential anti-aging effects of the related sirtuins in many species including a possible role in the effects of calorie-restriction on life span in C. elegans [39] and other species [40]. It might be thought that its neuroprotective effect could be related to its general effect on ageing. Recent work has, however, largely eliminated a role for sir-2.1 in increasing lifespan following the removal of an additional unrelated mutation in the worm strain studied. In contrast, a neuroprotective effect on a polyQ model of neurodegeneration remained associated with sir-2.1 overexpression [41]. A neuroprotective role of calorie restriction in C. elegans has also been shown to be mediated by sir-2.1 [42]. SIRT1, the mammalian orthologues of sir-2.1 and other histone deacetylases have been well established to regulate neurodegeneration and have been suggested as potential drug targets [43, 44]. The use of histone deacetylases inhibitors is currently being examined for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases but there are concerns about the potential detrimental effects of these inhibitors [43, 45].The epsilon isoform of the 14-3-3 proteins (CG31196) was identified in screens in the fly as a regulator of polyQ-mediated neurotoxicity. This fly protein has two worm orthologues (ftt-2 and par-5). One of these, ftt-2 has also been shown to be neuroprotective when over-expressed in a worm model of α-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity [46]. It has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins may increase lifespan and can interact with sir-2.1 [47, 48]. Recent work [49] has suggested that the neuroprotective role of 14-3-3 proteins in mammalian cells may be due to inhibition of the apoptotic factor Bax [49].A screen of genetic regulators of toxicity due to a mutant huntingtin fragment in S. cerevisiae identified Bna4 (kynurenine 3-monooxygenase) as the most potent suppressor [50]. Orthologues of Bna4 exist in D. melanogaster (CG1555) and in C. elegans (R07B7.5) but they were not identified in any of the screens in these organisms in Table 1. Nevertheless, recent studies have identified neuroprotective effects of inhibition or loss of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase and the kynurenine pathway in general in a Huntington's disease model in D. melanogaster and both Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease models in mice [51, 52] suggesting a similar role in different organisms. Significantly, the study in D. melanogaster [52] also showed that loss of function in the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase gene (vermillion) the first enzyme in the kynurenine pathway was neuroprotective. The C. elegans orthologue of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (C28H8.11) was one of the suppressors of α-synuclein inclusion formation identified in a genome wide screen in C. elegans [9]. These two enzymes can be regarded, therefore, as general regulators of neurodegeneration across species and diseases.Recent work has implicated defects in autophagy as a contributor to neurodegeneration and the process of autophagy as a key protective mechanism in preventing neurodegeneration [53–56]. Within the list of regulatory genes identified none encoded direct components of the autophagy machinery. Interestingly, however, the list of overlapping genes included sir-2.1 orthologues of which are involved in signalling pathways that control autophagy and thereby lifespan [53, 57]. In addition, rab-1 was discovered in genetic screens as a regulator of α-synuclein-mediated protein aggregation in a yeast model and is also effective in neuroprotection in worms and flies [58, 59]. The orthologues of rab-1 (specifically Rab1a in mammals) were recently shown to rescue an autophagy defect due to α-synuclein overexpression in mammalian cells and in Drosophila implicating the Rab1a isoform in autophagosome formation [54].A genome-wide screen for genes that modify toxicity of Aβ1-42 in S. cerevisiae has identified 23 suppressor and 17 enhancer genes [60]. Of these 12 have human and 11 C. elegans orthologues. Three of the conserved yeast suppressors (YAP1802, INP52 and SLA1) have known functions in endocytosis. In addition, the human orthologues (PICALM, SYNJ1 and SH3KBP1) have been found from genome-wide association studies to be risk factors themselves (PICALM) or alternatively (SYNJ1 and SH3KBP1) to interact with known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease [61, 62]. Examination of the effect the C. elegans orthologues (unc-11, unc-26 and Y44E3A.4) in a worm Aβ1-42 model confirmed that the endocytic genes had protective roles in this species [60]. Interestingly, a protective role for unc-11 and unc-26 has previously been identified in a C. elegans huntingtin polyQ disease model [13]. Overall these studies suggest an important role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in regulation of toxicity in different disease models.The other overlapping modifiers in Table 2 do not fit obviously into related functional classes but some of these genes may be generally significant. One that is noteworthy is the Acyl-CoA oxidase that was identified in all three model species in different disease models. The single orthologue in yeast, pox1, was identified as a regulator of α-synuclein toxicity in yeast [24]. The fly orthologue FBgn0027572 (CG5009) was identified in a genome wide screen for regulators of polyQ ataxin-3-mediated neurodegeneration in the eye where its over-expression suppressed the phenotype [63]. In addition, CG5009 also suppressed tau-mediated toxicity. Search of the Princeton Protein Orthology Database identifies seven orthologues of the yeast and fly genes in C. elegans (C48B4.1, F08A8.2, F08A8.3, F08A8.4, F08A8.1, F59F4.1, F25C8.1) and an additional orthologue has been postulated (F58F9.7) [64]. It is possible that all of the predicted worm acyl CoA oxidases could have overlapping functions. Of these orthologues, however, only the worm F59F4.1 gene was identified as a regulator of α-synuclein aggregate formation in a large scale RNAi screen where its knock down enhanced aggregation [65] suggesting that this particular orthologue has a non-redundant role. Interestingly in the fly model CG5009 was functionally linked to protein folding mechanisms based on an examination of effects of its over-expression on defects due to expression of a dominant negative form of Hsp70 [63]. The effect of over-expression of CG5009 was to enhance the defect, an effect that was also seen with the Hsp70 co-chaperone DnaJ-1. A single orthologue (ACOX1) is present in mammals where it is localised to peroxisomes and functions in β-oxidation of fatty acids. The potential importance of peroxisomes in general and more specifically acyl-CoA oxidase in neuroprotection is highlighted by the Zellweger class of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders in which there are severe neurological abnormalities. Mutations in ACOX1 (OMIM number 609751) are liked to clinical conditions which include a range of neurological problems. The function of acyl-CoA oxidase in fatty acid metabolism and its widespread tissue distribution results, however, in a range of clinical symptoms in conditions of reduced enzyme activity [66]. Acyl CoA oxidase has not previously been given serious consideration as regulator of neurodegeneration in specifically-targeted studies.","An integrated analysis of data available from genetic screens of regulators of neurodegeneration in various disease models in yeast, fly and worms has identified 34 shared regulators. This is a higher number than was expected from previous studies. There are some additional candidate gene studies and screens on cell lines that were not included in this analysis and so the number could potentially be increased by incorporation of these. Several of the shared regulators identified here are members of classes of genes encoding proteins involved in protein folding and/or ubiquitin-dependent pathways. These form a group of 6 directly interacting proteins with the E3 ligase CHIP linking the two functional pathways. Other shared regulators that have received previous attention in targeted studies on neuroprotection included histone deacetylases and 14-3-3 proteins. Interestingly, other shared regulators emerged which have not previously been considered as key regulators of neurodegeneration including acyl-CoA oxidase. The role in neuroprotection of acyl-CoA oxidase, in particular, clearly warrants further study.","Literature MiningStudies using genetic approaches to study genetic regulators of neurodegenerative disease models in C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster were identified using key word searches in PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez). The identified published literature was manually curated to compile a collection of experimentally delineated genetic modifiers of protein aggregation, misfolding and neurodegeneration in C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster. Files containing full lists of modifiers in the online supplemental materials of the papers were converted and imported into Microsoft Excel.Orthologue searchIndividual worm orthologues of yeast and fly modifier genes were identified by searching the Princeton Protein Orthology Database (P-POD version 4) (http://ortholog.princeton.edu/findorthofamily.html) [26] and use of OrthoMCL [67] to determine the appropriate orthologues. These identifications were further checked and refined by consulting WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org/) using the ""best Blast score"", Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (http://www.yeastgenome.org) and FlyBase (http://flybase.org) and use of BLAST searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Information on the list of modifiers was further refined by conducting search queries in the bioinformatic interfaces at WormBase [WormBase Web site, available at http://www.wormbase.org, release version WS224, April, 2011], Biomart [http://www.biomart.org/], and GExplore 1.1 [http://genome.sfu.ca/gexplore/].Analysis of protein-protein interactionsKnown protein-protein interactions amongst orthologues of the overlapping genetic regulators was identified by manual searches using the protein interaction databases BioGrid, IntAct, MINT, the Human Protein Reference Database and by literature searches on PubMed"
4,Frequency of genetic diseases and health coverage of children requiring admission in a general pediatric clinic of northern Greece,"In the last 40 years, several studies investigated the frequency of genetic diseases in pediatric hospitals in developed countries [1–5]. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a study has never been done in Greece. The University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis is the teaching hospital of the Medical School of the Democritus University of Thrace. It is located in the area of Evros, Thrace, in Northern Greece, and has a well-organized and adequately staffed Department of Pediatrics with 40 beds. However, no inpatient subspecialty units (e.g., Hematology/Oncology, Nephrology, ICU, etc.) exist within this Department.The purpose of the current work was to categorize the admissions in the Department of Pediatrics of the University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis over the period 2005-2007 by the main system/organ involved, to calculate the frequency of diseases with a genetic background in the hospitalized children, and finally to estimate the percentage of hospitalized children who were uninsured, and the type of health insurance of those who had medical coverage. Although the percentage of genetic diseases and the availability of health coverage in hospitalized children are not directly linked, knowledge of both is useful for planning better pediatric services in our area.","We hand-searched the medical records of the Department of Pediatrics of the University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis for all children who were hospitalized over the three-year period 1/1/2005-31/12/2007. Our hospital which is a General University Hospital has a system of recording electronically the name of the child admitted to the Department of Pediatrics along with the final diagnosis. Since this process is not free of risks for mistakes, we hand-searched the medical records of all admitted children, not just the discharge summaries, in order to be confident that the correct diagnosis was recorded. Additional information extracted from the medical records was sex, and type of health insurance of the admitted children. Although data extraction from the medical records was done by personnel without a medical degree (DK, PM), assignment to the categories of diseases with a genetic background was supervised by the first two authors who are physicians (TL and EM). Duplicate admissions, i.e., admissions of the same child for the same underlying disease were excluded.Diseases were categorized in terms of the major organ and/or system involved and/or the underlying pathology, except in cases of unspecified organ and/or system involvement, when inclusion into the others category was assigned. Respiratory diseases of known infectious etiology (e.g., pneumonias with positive blood cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae) were grouped as infectious diseases. Infectious diseases of the respiratory tract of unknown etiology were grouped under the respiratory diseases category.In case that a child with a known single-gene or chromosomal syndrome was admitted for a common pediatric problem (e.g., a febrile respiratory infection), both diagnoses i.e., the syndrome and the infection were recorded. This created few duplicate entries that however, did not alter our overall results.We used a categorization of diseases similar to that of Shawn et al., which is a modification of an earlier work by Hall et al, in order to allow for the increased recognition of the genetic contribution of various chronic medical conditions [1, 3]. Table 1 describes the categories used, as well as examples from each category. In particular, category I (underlying conditions with strong genetic basis) includes individuals with congenital underlying conditions, with various subcategories designed to further refine the genetic component. Category II (birth defects without known genetic basis) includes individuals with birth defects that are not known to have a genetic basis, including teratogenic effects. This classification does not imply that possible genetic causes have been disproved, but only that current evidence is not strong enough for an underlying genetic cause to be considered in their pathogenesis. Category III (acquired disorders with genetic predisposition) includes individuals with acquired disorders for which the medical literature and clinical experience suggest a genetic component, predisposition, or genetically determined susceptibility [3].Table 1 Determination of disease categories with genetic background in the hospitalized children along with clinical examples.Full size tableAll admissions were categorized into four age groups: <1 month (neonates), 1 month-1 year (infants), 1 year-5 years (pre-school children), and >5 years. Possible sex differences between children who suffered from diseases with a genetic background compared with those who did not suffer from such a disease and distribution of the causes of admission by study year was compared by chi-square. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.","There were 5,395 admissions over the study period, of which 448 were excluded because they were duplicates, leaving a total of 4,947 eligible admissions. Approximately 30% of the admissions were due to respiratory diseases, with no significant change over time. The second most common category included infectious and parasitic diseases (26.4%), followed by genitourinary (6%), neurologic (5.8%), and gastrointestinal diseases (4.4%), poisonings and accidents (3.9%), blood diseases (2%), circulatory system diseases and endocrine and metabolic diseases (with 0.8% each), cutaneous diseases (0.7%), musculoskeletal diseases (0.6%), collagen vascular diseases (0.5%), behavioral disorders (0.4%) and chromosomal abnormalities and syndromes (0.06%). Approximately 17.6% of the admissions belonged to the ""others"" category. There was a statistically significant decrease over time in neurologic, blood and circulatory system diseases (p < 0.05). Among the 4,947 admissions, 246 (approximately 5%) were due to diseases with an underlying genetic background. Detailed information for these admissions including sex and age of the admitted children are given in Table 2. Table 3 shows the categorization of admissions by major system involved and/or underlying etiology by study year. Overall, 57% of the admitted children were boys. Among children suffering from a disease with a genetic background, approximately 62% were males. There was no significant sex difference between children who suffered from diseases with a genetic background compared with those who didn't. Most children (42%) requiring hospitalization were 1-5 years old, followed by children aged >5 years, infants, and neonates with 32%, 25% και 1%, respectively.Table 2 Information for the number of admitted children, their sex and age based on the categories with genetic background of Table 1.Full size tableTable 3 Categorization of admissions by major system involved and/or underlying etiology.Full size tableIn each of the three study years, most children (39.4%) were insured by the foundation of social insurance (IKA) that is responsible for the health coverage of people working in the private sector of the economy. A total of 17.4% of the children were insured by the national government, because one or both parents worked in public positions, another 13.7% were insured by the publicly-funded agricultural insurance agency, 10.5% of very low-income patients had welfare and 6.7% were insured by the fund for merchants and self-employed small-business owners. Children insured with minor health insurance agencies were grouped together and constituted 1.6% of the total admissions. Remarkably, 10.3% of the admitted children were uninsured.","The goals of this retrospective study were to categorize by system and/or organ involved the admissions in the Department of Pediatrics of the University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis over a three-year period, to calculate the documented frequency of genetic diseases and of diseases with a genetic background in the hospitalized children, and finally to estimate the percentage of hospitalised children who were uninsured and the type of health insurance of those with medical coverage.Approximately 56% of the admissions were due to respiratory and/or infectious problems that are usually more prominent during the winter months. Although only 0.06% of the admitted children had a known chromosomal abnormality, if we consider diseases with a genetic basis, this percentage rises to 5%. This figure, although lower than the double figure of admissions associated with environmental factors (i.e., respiratory and/or infectious problems), demonstrates that genetic and ""partially"" genetic diseases impose a considerable financial burden in the delivery of pediatric health services in our area. Moreover, this percentage is in all likelihood an underestimate of the true impact of genetic diseases in pediatric inpatient care, since as previously explained our Department cares only for children with general pediatric problems and has no specialized subspecialty inpatient units.Review of the medical literature reveals that the percentage of children with a genetic disease or a disease with an underlying genetic background is substantial and requires our attention. For example, according to the 2006 annual review of vital statistics in USA, congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 4.6% of all deaths in the age group 1 to 19 years[6]. More recent studies show that 98% of children admitted over a year in a children's hospital had indications for illnesses with a genetic etiology, even though this was not demonstrated on the final diagnosis and release papers [3]. Likewise, Hall et al. reported that in a general pediatric hospital, 4.5% of admitted children had a clear genetic disorder, and that 48.9% of admissions were due to a multi-factorial/polygenic disorder (22.1%), developmental anomaly (13.6%) or familial disorder (13.2%). Although our categorization is a modification of Hall et al, it is worth mentioning that in our Department of Pediatrics that is located within a General Hospital 8.9% of admitted children had a single-gene or chromosomal disease (category 1A), 4% had multifactorial/polygenic (category 1B) diseases, 8.1% had heterogeneous causes for admission, often of a genetic basis (category 1C) and finally 79% had acquired disorders with genetic predisposition (category 3) (Table 2).At this point, we should mention that the contribution of genetic disorders and congenital malformations in the total number of admissions is much higher in pediatric long-term care facilities, and specialized pediatric hospitals, in particular those with competence in clinical genetics. For example, a study that was performed in a pediatric long-term care and rehabilitation center revealed that genetic disorders and congenital anomalies were responsible for 50% of the overall admissions and for 60% of end-of-life care admissions [7]. Furthermore, a considerable percentage/number of genetic disorders is not diagnosed during the early years of life. Thus, the management of genetic diseases imposes substantial societal, medical and financial burdens in the delivery of pediatric health services, albeit smaller than that of diseases with environmental pathogenesis.Substantially more boys than girls required hospitalization in our department. This finding is in agreement with the available literature showing that boys at a young age appear to be more susceptible, especially to infections than girls [1, 5]. Among admitted children suffering from a disease with a genetic background, approximately 60% were males, i.e., the percentage of males with a genetic disease was proportional to the percentage of admitted boys (57%). Finally, irrespective of sex and underlying disease, most children (42%) requiring hospitalization were 1 to 5 years old. Regarding the significant decrease in the number of neurologic, blood and circulatory system diseases over time, we have no explanation for this finding, although our study was only extended over a three-year period and longer follow-up over a decade or more may prove this finding to be due to chance.Regarding health coverage, as expected, most hospitalized children were covered under IKA, an organization that insures workers in the private sector of the economy. These workers are allowed to visit a limited number of pediatricians, who are paid a salary irrespective of the number of insured children examined. Hence, the parents need to pay money out of pocket in case they prefer to have their child examined by a private pediatrician who has no contract with IKA. Moreover, IKA does not operate facilities for inpatient care. That is why the parents of children who are insured with IKA frequently prefer to visit hospitals of the National Health System, like our hospital, for free medical services, especially if there is a possibility their child will require hospitalization.A very interesting and worrisome finding of this study is that 1 in 10 children requiring admission in our hospital is uninsured and another 10.5% originates from families with extremely low income that are on welfare. Hence, despite of the presence of a National Health System in Greece, many children remain completely uninsured or have limited health coverage (welfare). We consider that these figures are worrisome and indicative of the relatively poor socioeconomic standards and living conditions of our area that has many immigrants and people with different educational, religious, and social backgrounds. Consequently, we believe that the Greek government should increase its efforts for providing universal pediatric health coverage, an achievable and not idealistic goal, something that may not be the case for adults due to the much higher cost required.In conclusion, the percentage of children with a genetically determined disease and with partially genetic diseases requiring admission in a Department of Pediatrics located within a general hospital of Northern Greece is approximately 5%, a figure that is in close agreement with the available medical literature that originates from general not specialized pediatric hospitals. Our results can assist health-care administrators to plan for the health needs of the children in our area, and moreover justify the development and funding of a specialized, academic department for the study of genetic diseases that in close cooperation with the Department of Pediatrics will provide quality services for the children of our area [4, 7–9]."
