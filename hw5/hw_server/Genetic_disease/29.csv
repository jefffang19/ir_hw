0,Meeting report from the Companion Animal Genetic Health conference 2018 (CAGH 2018): a healthy companionship: the genetics of health in dogs,"The first meeting for the Companion Animal Genetic Health (CAGH) conference invited scientists from around Europe interested in dog and cat health to discuss their research. The meeting was open to all aspects of companion animal research but discussions mainly covered three central themes across the conference. The first was the importance of obtaining high-quality data for the characteristics that are under investigation. Examples presented were appetite, cardiac measurement, and skull shape, which along with genetic data can be used to investigate specific disorders. Detailed owner questionnaires formed a large part of these endeavours and are crucial to generate detailed information about certain characteristics such as behaviour. The second theme centred on the use of whole genome (DNA) sequences to investigate a range of inherited diseases and the importance of the field’s successful international data sharing for this purpose. Talks given also highlighted the need for an updated reference dog DNA sequence and tools to help identify more complex DNA variation (i.e. not simple single-base (letter) changes; larger insertions or deletions of DNA of more than 1000 bases for example). Lastly, there is now a real focus on understanding the biological processes underlying a mutation that has been associated with disease. As well as informing veterinary and possibly also human medicine, these studies will be important for complex diseases such as cancer that may not be amenable to DNA tests, but that research will inform in terms of diagnosis and treatment.","This inaugural meeting of geneticists, clinicians and epidemiologists encompassed discussion, presentations and abstracts from researchers working predominantly in the field of canine genetics and health, but also included representatives working in feline genomics. The conference sought to bring together researchers in the field from around Europe to share their latest research findings, discuss new techniques and establish new collaborations. Dr. Cathryn Mellersh and Dr. Jeffrey Schoenebeck hosted the two-day meeting which saw forty-five delegates from seven European countries present seventeen short talks and nine posters largely covering canine research but also including feline abstracts. Dr. Robert Ogden, senior lecturer and Head of Conservation Genetics at the University of Edinburgh, gave an intriguing keynote lecture on his work using animal genetics in molecular ecology, population genetics and conservation projects to guide species management and law enforcement across the world. The Royal (Dick) School for Veterinary Studies, the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Genomics helped sponsor the meeting. Following the success of this inaugural meeting, CAGH organisers are looking to repeat the event in the summer of 2020 with the ambition to appeal to the wider companion animal veterinary research community. We present here a summary of the meeting in which we will discuss its central themes, referring to the accompanying abstracts in this issue of the Journal, and the directions in which the field is moving in relation to these themes.","CAGH enjoyed a diverse range of talks covering a wide variety of different traits, each of which requiring a unique and interesting method for phenotype capture. Precision phenotyping included using computer tomography (CT) scans to generate high resolution replicas of the canine skull to assist in fine-mapping the brachycephalic canine head shape locus. A complementary study then scored a variety of phenotypes of the upper airway to determine the genetic contributions to upper airway syndromes in brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic breeds (Marchant et al. O5). Several abstracts described the use of owner-targeted questionnaires to capture extensive datasets for canine traits and disease epidemiology in dogs. In addition, developments in using automated algorithms to ‘clean’ error-prone large survey datasets presented exciting possibilities for future survey-based studies to enrich and increase the power of their data collection (Woolley et al. P6).","As anticipated and in line with human disease research, there is an increasing number of Mendelian (predominantly autosomal recessive) canine diseases for which the genetic cause is being characterised by whole genome sequencing (WGS) alone in the absence of any prior knowledge or mapping experiments. The WGS studies presented at this meeting sequenced one or more affected cases from a particular dog breed, and in two instances their first-degree unaffected relatives. Using in-house or collaborative WGS databases of animals from multiple breeds/cross breeds/canids, benign variants have been ‘filtered’ to focus in on a small number (< 20) of gene polymorphisms only found in cases. These studies have underlined the importance of the availability of collaborative and shared canine WGS databases, particularly the Dog Biomedical Variant Database Consortium (DBVDC) that was utilised in much of the research presented. The DBVDC is an international collaboration organised and curated by Professor Tosso Leeb and Dr. Vidhya Jagannathan at the University of Bern, Switzerland, that currently includes data from > 20 collaborators and is currently comprised of WGS data from over 550 purebred dogs and multiple cross breeds and wolves. Another growing WGS database that will also contribute to the DBVDC is the ‘Give a Dog a Genome’ project (Burmeister et al. P3). This project is led by Dr. Cathryn Mellersh and Dr. Louise Burmeister at the Kennel Club Genetics Centre at the Animal Health Trust, UK, and currently comprises WGS of one or more individuals of > 100 breeds. The extensive Cani-DNA biobank run by Dr. Catherine André at the University of Rennes, France has also contributed to research endeavours investigating both simple and complex canine genetic diseases (Botherel et al. P2; Correard et al. O9; Hédan et al. O3; Rimbault et al. O1). Excitingly, the results of these studies are now being translated to their human disease counterparts, with the potential for future impact on both the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions in both dogs and humans. This highlights a continuing important role of the pedigree dog in informing human disease and medicine.Two studies presented at this meeting have found variants in novel genes not previously associated with the disease under investigation (Hitti, Oliver et al. O10; Jenkins et al. O6). Whilst the confirmation of these gene variants as mutations is somewhat dependent on both their disease co-segregation in extended breed-matched sample sets and the availability of relevant tissues for functional analyses to mitigate against false-positive/incidental findings, all of the above studies illustrate the power of using these multi-breed WGS databases to refine the number of variants that require ‘wet lab’ follow-up. It is very likely that the increased pace and cost-effectiveness of mutation identification of autosomal recessive canine diseases over the next few years will facilitate a move towards the development of a clinical sequencing initiative for dogs, with the necessary input of the referring specialist clinician for disease characterisation and to aid in the downstream clarification of genetic findings to clinical disease. With these cross-discipline collaborations, this should have a significant impact on mitigating the spread of new autosomal recessive mutations in the canine population, by WGS of the first emerging affected dogs."
1,Health care providers and direct-to-consumer access and advertising of genetic testing in the United States,"The pharmaceutical industry exerts tremendous influence on medical practice through the marketing of drugs and medical devices to physicians and consumers. Direct-to-physician advertising (DTPA), which is common in most developed countries, occurs through sales pitches from pharmaceutical representatives who provide details about specific drugs (physician detailing) and through providing free samples, continuing medical education, advertising in medical journals, and direct mailings [1, 2]. Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), which is legally permitted only in the US and New Zealand, primarily occurs through broadcast and print advertisements. DTCA on the internet, however, reaches an international audience [3]. In the US, direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing of pharmaceuticals dramatically increased in 1997 after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) loosened regulation of broadcast advertising [4]. The revised guidance stated that DTC broadcast advertisements only had to include a major statement of risks and make adequate provision for consumers to obtain the FDA-approved product labeling [5]. Although spending on DTPA still outweighs spending on DTCA [2, 6, 7], the amount spent on DTCA continues to rise. Between 1996 and 2005, DTCA spending increased 330% to $4.2 billion [7].Congruent with the change in the regulation of broadcast advertising and advances in genetic technology, the past decade has seen a significant increase in the availability of health and non-health related genetic tests that are sold and advertised directly to consumers by for-profit companies [8]. Health-related genetic tests are clinical genetic tests that provide information to support the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a disease (for example, carrier, pre-symptomatic, susceptibility, pharmacogenetic and nutrigenetic tests) [9]. Examples of health-related tests that are the focus of this review include genetic testing for single-gene disorders that have large effect sizes (for example, tests for the BRCA breast-cancer genes or carrier tests for cystic fibrosis) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genomic risk profiling for drug response and susceptibility to complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Genome-wide analysis studies currently form the basis of risk-profiling tests and tend to have small effect sizes (odds ratio <1.5) [10]. Examples of non-health-related tests include paternity and ancestry testing. There are also tests that predict height, athletic performance and cognitive traits (Table 1).Table 1 Types of DTC genetic testsFull size tableThere are two primary scenarios for advertising and selling drugs and tests to consumers. The first is the advertisement directly to the consumer of a drug or test that must be prescribed or ordered by a health care provider (HCP). Examples include any medication that requires a prescription and most genetic testing for single-gene disorders. The second scenario is the advertisement and sale of a test directly to consumers (direct-access testing). Examples of direct-access tests that consumers can purchase for home use (the user collects the sample, and performs and interprets the test) include urine tests for pregnancy or ovulation and blood glucose tests. For home collection tests, the user collects the sample but the sample is sent to a laboratory for testing; sometimes the user interprets the results themselves, sometimes the results are phoned back to the user and counseling is provided. Examples of home collection tests include tests for HIV1 antibodies and hepatitis C, and genomic risk profiling for disease susceptibility and drug response offered through companies that sell genetic tests DTC [9]. In 2011, the Genetics and Public Policy Center provided a list of genetic tests for over 350 conditions or traits that were advertised or sold DTC and the companies that sold those tests. Two-thirds of DTC-testing companies offered direct-access testing, whereas about one-third marketed tests directly to consumers and physicians but required that a physician order the testing [11].Previous reviews have addressed the ethical, legal and social implications of DTC genetic testing (DTC-GT), consumers' views on DTC-GT, and regulatory issues that are specific to genetic testing [12–15]. This review touches on the complex roles that marketing pressures, regulatory policies, clinical guidelines, and consumer demand play on HCPs' knowledge and use of health-related genetic tests that are sold and/or advertised to consumers. First, I provide an overview of DTCA and of the regulation of pharmaceuticals and genetic tests in the US. Then I discuss recent cultural shifts in the regulation of genetic tests offered DTC, and finally I review the literature that describes the impact on HCPs of selling and advertising DTC genetic tests.","The pros and cons of DTCA of pharmaceuticals have been vigorously debated [16–23]. Proponents of DTCA claim that it helps educate consumers, generates patient-provider discussions, and empowers consumers to get involved in their own health care by seeking information on and treatment for their health conditions. Theoretically, clinicians then benefit from more thoughtful questions from patients and from increased patient and physician awareness of medications. Some also argue that DTCA encourages competition among pharmaceutical companies and leads to price reductions where there are competing drugs. Opponents voice concerns about the quality of information presented to consumers, stating that it can be misleading or misrepresent information and that it results in consumer misunderstanding, increased demand for inappropriate medications, or consumer decisions that are based on inappropriate criteria. Additional concerns include disruption of the provider-patient relationship, increased provider time spent correcting misconceptions, overprescribing of drugs and tests because of consumer pressure on providers, and increased costs to society and the health care system.Numerous studies have been conducted to determine providers' perceptions of DTCA of pharmaceuticals, as well as the impact of such advertising on provider behaviors [6, 23–30]. Results from physician surveys suggest that most physicians feel that DTCA of pharmaceuticals can help to educate consumers about available treatments and medical issues and can facilitate better discussions with their patients [24, 29, 30]. Nonetheless, physicians also feel that DTCA encourages consumers to seek medications that they do not need and that DTCA does not provide balanced information on costs, adverse events and alternative treatment options [24, 29]. Content analyses of television [31, 32] and magazine ads [23] support physician concerns, suggesting that advertisements do not provide balanced or consistent information on risks and benefits, disease risk factors or causes, or treatments. In addition, one study found that a college-level reading ability was needed to access the brief summary sections [31]. Surveys of consumers suggest that DTCA increases awareness and motivates discussions between patients and providers. Different studies report that between 13% and 35% of surveyed consumers have talked to their provider about a specific medication or asked for more information as a result of DTCA [29, 30, 33, 34].Surveys and randomized trials all suggest that consumers who request a prescription for a specific drug are more likely to receive one than are patients who do not ask for a specific treatment [26, 28], and that DTCA increases both appropriate and inappropriate prescribing of advertised drugs by physicians [7, 27, 28, 30, 35]. Although overuse of drugs wastes resources, cost-benefit models suggest that, in some scenarios, the cost of treating those without disease could be outweighed by the benefit of treating those with disease [35]. However, treating patients with a newer, more-expensive DTCA medication that is merely a substitute for a generic or an existing less-expensive drug results in increased costs without benefit to those with disease [27, 36]. There is also concern that racial and ethnic differences in response to DTCA could exacerbate existing health disparities. Studies suggest that minorities are more likely to be influenced by DTCA of pharmaceuticals than non-minorities [29, 37], and that minorities are also more likely to ask their physicians for an advertised drug but be refused [37]. Appropriate prescribing of medications and ordering of genetic testing will result in the greatest benefit to patients and society; and this occurs when clinical guidelines exist and HCPs are aware of them and follow them [27, 36].","The pros and cons of DTCA of health-related genetic tests are similar to those for DTCA of pharmaceuticals, with a few noted differences. A similar concern is the possibility that adverse outcomes could result from misleading portrayals of the benefits of tests by DTC-GT companies and from difficulties that consumers could have in interpreting risk information provided by DTC television ads or supplemental text materials [31, 38–40]. Such adverse outcomes could include increased anxiety, false reassurance, or inappropriate use of health care services [41–44]. The incorrect interpretation of test results by consumers is also a concern. For example, consumers could potentially change their dosage of a medication or even stop taking a medication on the basis of the results of a pharmacogenetic or other genomic risk profiling test [9]. DTCA of genetic testing increases consumer and provider awareness of and demand for testing [45–47], but informed consent about the benefits and limitations of DTC genetic tests, and provider knowledge regarding such tests, remains a concern, particularly for SNP-based genomic risk profiling [45, 48]. Although socioeconomic status has been associated with differential awareness and interest in DTC-GT, it is unclear whether interest or use differs by ethnicity [49, 50].The regulation of genetic tests by the FDA is limited in comparison with that of the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, limited data are available on the clinical validity and utility of most genetic tests offered DTC. Several studies have found that SNP-based estimates of the risk of disease susceptibility vary across DTC-GT companies [51–54], and are likely to be revised as new loci are found [55]. There is also a large gap in provider education and knowledge regarding the clinical utility of genetic tests [56–58], partly as a result of the rapid commercialization of emerging genetic technologies and tests. The benefits of direct-access genetic testing include increased patient autonomy and privacy [13] and increased access to genetic testing [59]. Proponents also argue that DTCA of genetic tests increases consumer knowledge and empowers individuals to take part in their own health care [41]. For example, in the case of hereditary cancer syndromes, DTCA may prompt those with cancer or a strong family history of cancer to pursue cancer risk assessment and to obtain the indicated genetic tests [60]. The risk of health and employment discrimination that is based on an individual's genetic information has been reduced with the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), but GINA does not protect against discrimination in applications for life, disability, or long-term care insurance [61, 62].","In addition to DTCA and DTPA of genetic tests, regulatory policies impact HCP behavior and knowledge (Figure 1). The distinction between regulation of advertising and regulation of testing is important because the lack of regulation of genetic tests influences what can be advertised. The FDA regulates drugs and medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic tests, to ensure their safety and efficacy before they are made available to consumers. All pharmaceuticals must be FDA approved before they can be advertised to consumers and most drugs that are advertised DTC go onto the market within a year after FDA approval [7]. However, the regulatory processes for genetic tests differ from those for pharmaceuticals. The FDA regulates genetic tests that are sold as kits because they are considered to be medical devices. The FDA also regulates analyte-specific reagents (ASRs), but most genetic tests are laboratory-developed tests, which have been unregulated at the discretion of the FDA. Thus, most genetic tests are not subject to FDA review, and DTC companies have had few barriers to market entry [13]. Indeed, in 2003, seven websites offered health-related DTC genetic tests to consumers [63]. In 2009, the Genetics and Public Policy Center listed 39 companies offering such tests via the internet [64]. By 2011, this number had dropped to 27 [11] subsequent to the issuance of FDA letters to DTC companies and test manufacturers stating that the tests and services they offered appeared to meet the definition of a device and therefore needed FDA approval [65, 66]. In addition, in 2011, after the FDA issued its letters, only 20 companies were listed as offering direct-access genetic testing compared to 39 in 2009 [11].Figure 1External factors impacting the knowledge and behavior of health care providers regarding DTC genetic testing.Full size imageThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with protecting consumers against unfair or deceptive acts or practices and against false advertising for drugs, devices, or services. The FTC investigates 'false advertising' claims and regulates the advertising of over-the-counter drugs [67]. Historically, false or deceptive advertising of genetic tests has not been actively prosecuted by the FTC because they have limited resources and because the lack of regulation makes it difficult to determine what is false advertising as opposed to innovative new use. Thus, the FTC has focused on significant safety concerns and on products or services that are marketed nationwide [68]. In 2006, however, the FTC (along with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) developed a fact sheet warning consumers to be skeptical about genetic tests offered DTC [69]. In 2009, the FTC investigated the marketing of the MyCellf™ Program by two DTC-GT companies but decided not to take action when both companies stopped marketing this product [70, 71].The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulate all US clinical laboratory testing, through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), whether the test is ordered by consumers or providers [72]. CLIA regulations establish laboratory standards for quality assurance and quality control, personnel, proficiency testing, and maintenance of records. Thus, the CLIA regulations focus on the quality of the testing process while the FDA regulations focus on the safety and efficacy of the test itself [73]. Although molecular genetic testing is considered to be high-complexity testing (which requires a high degree of skill to perform or interpret), genetic testing has not been defined as a specialty area [13]. Thus, there are no federal requirements for testing the proficiency of molecular genetic testing [72]. The CDC recently published 'Good Laboratory Practices for Molecular Genetic Testing for Heritable Disorders and Conditions', which recommends that laboratories participate in available proficiency testing [74], such as that offered by the College of American Pathologists. Nonetheless, external proficiency testing programs are limited and the lack of such programs is the most common reason cited by laboratory directors for not participating in proficiency testing [75, 76].States can choose to follow CLIA or adopt more stringent statutes and regulations. New York and Washington have state-alternatives to CLIA. States can also require HCPs to authorize laboratory tests [13]. Thirteen states prohibit direct-access genetic testing [77].An added regulatory challenge is that pharmaceutical and DTC-GT companies can reach a global audience through both passive and interactive (for example, social media) internet technologies, crossing state and national boundaries [3, 63, 78]. There are no international regulations governing DTC genetic testing, further compounding concerns regarding information privacy, access to health care, informed decision-making, patient safety, and access to unbiased information [3, 79]."
2,Hiper IgD syndrome (HIDS): clinical and genetic features in five patients,"The Hiper-IgD Syndrome (HIDS) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent febrile episodes each 4–8 weeks accompanied by an intense inflammatory reaction, lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgias, hepatosplenomegaly and cutaneous signs [1]. Mutations in the gene that codifies the enzyme mevalonate kinase (MVK), located in the chromosome 12q24, have been demonstrated to be the cause of this syndrome [2].",We describe the clinical and genetic findings of three families (five patients) with diagnosis of HIDS and confirmed mutational analysis.,We present a retrospective analysis of the patients and its genealogical tree. The mutational analysis was made by the service of Inmunology of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.,"Clinically the five patients presented the typical symptomatology with recurrent febrile episodes, intense abdominal pain (a case required several exploratory laparotomies), cervical lymphadenopathy, diarrhea and hepatosplenomegaly. One of the patients presented a chilotorax that resolved after discarding amiloidosis and initiating treatment. In all cases mutations I268T or V377I were detected. In two of the families, the parents demonstrated to be heterozygote carriers of one of the two found mutations.All the patients have required steroids to high doses, nevertheless, three of the cases have developed steroid dependency with necessity of biological treatment with Anakinra, a recombinant, nonglycosylated synthetic form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), Kineret®) that in last publications has demonstrated to be the election treatment since the Hiper IgD Syndrome is part of the autoinflammatory diseases in whose common pathogenic mechanism the IL-1 takes part."
3,Genetic counselling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: are we ready for it?,"A young boy of 13 collapsed while running after the schoolbus. He could be resuscitated, but at the price of crippling brain damage. Clinical and genetic analysis subsequently revealed that he and his father were predisposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): they were carriers of a missense mutation in the α-tropomyosin gene. The boy had no symptoms before he collapsed, whereas his father (in his early forties) had borderline myocardial hypertrophy in the interventricular septum associated with mild symptoms of cardiac disease. A daughter, age 11, also carried the mutation, but she was entirely asymptomatic. On average, penetrance of the disease gene was incomplete in this family. The boy's collapse was presumably due to an episode of extreme ventricular tachycardia. Although the familial character of the disorder was suspected for some time prior to this event, genetic counselling had not been considered before the boy experienced cardiac arrest.In a second family the disease was associated with a high frequency of cardiac death. Three documented cases of premature sudden death in two generations, two of them in young adults, and numerous relatives being clinically affected imposed a heavy burden on the family. Early onset of the disease, syncopes, chest pain and progression to heart failure with no, or inconspicuous, hypertrophy were encountered. A few patients were only mildly affected. A mutation in the cardiac troponin T gene was identified by genetic analysis. All first-degree relatives of the patients were seeking counselling and asked for a DNA test. They were aware that this test offered a 50% chance of excluding the carrier status for those who were asymptomatic, in particular for children of parents at risk. Hence, parents also asked on behalf of their children.These are two different disease phenotypes randomly picked from numerous published or unpublished case reports of familial HCM. This is a heavily investigated disorder for which we have ample knowledge about causes and - to a lesser degree - about mechanisms. It is autosomal dominant and known to exist worldwide with a prevalence possibly as high as 1:500 in the general population [1]. It may occur sporadically, but in the majority of cases it is a familial condition. Onset of symptoms is normally encountered during adolescence or in young adults, but first appearances may also be experienced in later decades of life. Symptoms are usually unspecific at first, and may include breathlessness, chest pain, syncopes and others. The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiographic demonstration of myocardial hypertrophy, most frequently in the interventricular septum. Diagnostic criteria for the assessment of the disease in members of families at risk have been proposed [2].","A major dysfunction in cardiac performance is impaired relaxation during diastole. Systolic functions are (at least in the beginning) not affected [3]. The most serious complication of HCM is ventricular fibrillation, which may cause sudden cardiac death.A typical problem is the extensive clinical variability of HCM, even within families where all patients have the same mutational background. The spectrum ranges from very mild or even asymptomatic to malignant courses. A multitude of causes has been identified. More than 100 different mutations (mostly missense mutations leading to amino acid exchanges in respective proteins) have been reported [4,5]. These mutations are in nine genes, all coding for contractile proteins - cardiac motor proteins and their control components. HCM was, therefore, defined as a disease of the sarcomere [6]. The most frequently affected genes, accounting for more than 50% of all cases, coded for β-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T and myosin binding protein-C. Mutational hot spots are rare and contribute only a few percent of the total genetic load of HCM.The mechanisms responsible for cardiac dysfunction and disease are not fully understood. Altered kinetics of cross-bridge cycling of myosin and actin filaments are probably involved [7]. Increased (or decreased) sensitivity of force development in response to calcium may be a critical parameter [8,9]. Other calcium-dependent mechanisms influencing gene expression rather than contraction have also been discussed [10].","Since HCM is inherited, a major question bears on genetic counselling. Is it available and what will it offer to whom? The goals of counselling are, in general, the assessment of causes, which requires genetic testing of probands and family members, the determination of recurrence risks, communication about reproductive options and prenatal diagnosis, if suggested or requested.The clinical diagnosis of HCM is made by the cardiologist who might then refer patients and families to the geneticist. Genetic tests are performed in specialised labs (of which only a few exist). The estimate of recurrence risks is easy in most instances, because the usual mode of transmission is known to be dominant. Dominant transmission (when only one parent is a carrier of the condition) means the parent has a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to their offspring. Recessive transmission (with both parents being carriers) is extremely rare. More challenging, but also rather infrequent, are asymptomatic parents with one affected child, a condition indicative of a new, or de novo, mutation which originated in a single parental gamete [11,12]. Such a mutation has a negligible chance of re-occurring in siblings, but it can be passed to the next generation by carriers.HCM is in many cases not a devastating condition and usually it does not produce symptoms in children, unlike Duchenne muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis. Many gene carriers have a reasonable chance of getting away with minor symptoms and normal life expectancy (see eg [13,14]); in some, however, quality of life and longevity may be severely affected. Families have been described where only 50% of gene carriers lived beyond the age of 45 years [15]. Although underlying mutations in these families are statistically characterised as malignant, it is difficult (if not impossible) to assign individual risks on the basis of a DNA test alone. Thus, in most cases of a positive HCM family history, reproductive decisions are normally not affected.Occasionally it may happen that premature sudden death is a frequent event imposing an unusually high psychosocial and medical burden on a family. In these cases prospective parents may wish to prevent passing the mutation to their offspring and, hence, ask for a pre-natal DNA test with the option to terminate a 'carrier' pregnancy. The test depends on knowledge of the mutation. If that information is not available, testing will normally be futile because of the current slow speed of screening genes for unidentified DNA changes. If the mutation is known, a preimplantation diagnosis after in vitro fertilisation may be considered as an alternative to prenatal testing [16].In addition to professional counselling by geneticists, a practice of informal communication developed in some institutions since the main reference person for HCM patients and their families is the cardiologist whom they see on a regular basis to control the progression of the disease and the efficacy of therapy. Diagnostic efforts require informed consent by the patient; this consent frequently covers the submission of blood samples to a specialised molecular lab for a DNA test, as part of a new clinical routine which should, but which frequently does not, include genetic counsel. This practice of quasi automatic DNA testing may not be the same in all countries, but at least in some places the geneticist is not regularly consulted. The reason is simply that it is the cardiologist, not the clinical geneticist, who has the main responsibility for the patient. The recognition that a patient is at high risk depends on identification of clinical markers such as excessive hypertrophy [17] or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [18] rather than on the demonstration of a particular mutation.The lack of appropriate counselling has, however, certain drawbacks. Normally it is the genetic counsellor, not the clinician, who is trained to explain the meaning of genetic risks in terms understandable to patients. The burden of the disease must be clearly communicated and reproductive options have to be discussed. Reassurance should be given to those who worry about the consequences of their genetic status. It may be added that these discussions should also cover health and life insurance problems which will probably become relevant in the future, in particular for those who have no symptoms but who are at risk to be gene carriers. Potential gene carriers with no symptoms may increasingly tend to refuse participation in familial screening to avoid unfavourable terms of insurance, a conflict to which young adults in their early career stages are exposed more than others. (The strategy of avoiding knowledge about genetic risks would, however, only work in the absence of compulsory testing). A serious question is whether DNA tests should be applied in children. They usually have no symptoms, and the test may therefore stigmatise them as gene carriers - in the absence of efficient prevention ([19], but see [20]). One should realise, however, that careful investigation of the preclinical stages of HCM will eventually help to advance knowledge of the natural history of the disease - a prerequisite to the development of improved protocols for prevention and therapy of this disorder. At present, in the absence of formal constraints to apply DNA tests to entire families, it can be foreseen and it seems inevitable that in a growing number of families all gene carriers will become known. As a rule (with occasional exceptions), both cardiologists and parents want to know. Appropriate communication with genetic counsellors should help to alleviate psychosocial and emotional problems associated with the assessment of the carrier status, in particular in the young. A scheme according to which cardiologists, clinical and molecular geneticists could cooperate in both aspects, counselling patients and managing HCM clinically, is presented in Fig. 1. This scheme emphasises the different branches involved in management and counselling of HCM, with a predominance on the side of clinical activities. Prenatal diagnosis - which in our experience is almost never requested - has not been considered in this scheme as a major topic.","A DNA test can confirm the diagnosis; however, in most cases, a sarcomeric mutation does not by itself fully explain the pathogenic character of the disease. For one, many families have their own 'private' mutation, and for another, evidence is accumulating that other components, for example genetic polymorphisms, which contribute to cardiovascular performance without being bona fide disease genes, also affect penetrance and severity of the disease. It is likely that non-Mendelian, multifactorial conditions modify the natural history of HCM [21] which otherwise is, by definition, a Mendelian disorder. The difficulties of drawing firm conclusions from knowledge of a mutation in a distinct disease-related gene should not excuse a lack of competent genetic counselling. Counselling is more than mutation detection. Appropriate activities depend on the existence of an organisation comprising cardiologists, a molecular laboratory, and clinical geneticists, as shown in the flow diagram of Fig. 1. Such an organization is not everywhere at hand. Since, however, knowledge and tools are in principle available, the appropriate answer to the initial question of whether to provide genetic counselling ""ready or not"" is that there is no good reason not to be ready.Figure 1A scheme for cooperative interaction between cardiologists, clinical and molecular geneticists and those affected by HCM.

4,Phenotypic differences between apolipoprotein E genetic subgroups: research and clinical implications,"Clinically, the effect of APOE genotype on age of onset has been reconfirmed many times since the original report from Roses' group [1]. APOE e4 increases the likelihood of conversion to dementia in patients with MCI by over fourfold [2]. The age of AD onset declines with increasing e4 dose and increases with increasing e2 dose. Preclinical memory decline accelerates in APOE e4 carriers prior to age 60 in a gene-dose pattern [3]. Van der Flier and colleagues [4] reviewed an extensive literature and proposed that e4 carriers have a more typical amnestic syndrome with greater hippocampal atrophy and an older age of onset while non-e4-related AD was characterized by variant syndromes (dysexecutive, aphasic, apraxic, and visual) with less hippocampal atrophy and a younger age of onset. In our Arizona APOE cohort, a longitudinal study of cognitive aging started in 1994 [3], we have had 34 incident AD cases (unpublished data), including seven e4 noncarriers (one of whom developed visual variant AD), and 27 carriers (seven of whom developed a variant AD syndrome). Additionally, four e4 carriers have developed a clinical synucleinopathy, including one with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease. We therefore see little evidence of the distinction described by van der Flier and colleagues, though admittedly our series of incident cases to date is relatively small.","Neuropathologically, there is over a 97% chance that an e4 carrier dying with dementia will have AD at autopsy [5]. It has been thought that e4 has a greater effect on amyloid than tau-based pathology, supported by the relative under-representation of e4 (and over-representation of e2) among patients with neurofibrillary tangle-predominant AD, a subgroup that tends to be in the older age range, but a more recent study of the oldest subjects showed that e2 carrier status was associated with greater amyloid as well as tau pathology, and the effect on amyloid was greater than that on tau [6]. More clearly established is that APOE e4 carriers have a higher burden of congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage [7]. Murray and colleagues [8] reviewed the neuropathological findings in 889 cases of AD, 472 of which had APOE genotype information, and proposed three subtypes, including hippocampal sparing (concordant with van der Flier and colleagues' non-e4 AD description), accounting for 11% of cases, typical AD, accounting for 75% of cases, and limbic-predominant, accounting for 14% of cases. APOE genotype failed to distinguish these groups, with e4 carrier frequencies of 50%, 59%, and 62%, respectively. However, when they stratified these subtypes by age of onset as less than or greater than 65 years, a high proportion of limbic-predominant cases were e4+ (71% of 45 late onset limbic predominant AD cases were e4+). A non-AD clinical diagnosis was more common in the hippocampal sparing group but this did not relate to e4 carrier status (in contrast to van der Flier and colleagues' hypothesis).","Another important consideration regards treatment response. An Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study group reported that, among a cohort of 516 patients with amnestic MCI, e4 carriers progressed more rapidly than noncarriers and called attention to the importance of balancing APOE genotype in clinical trial treatment arms [9]. Several studies have sought differential responsiveness to symptomatic therapy, with Poirer and colleagues [10] reporting in 1995 that e4 carriers responded less well than noncarriers to cholinomimetic therapy, and subsequent work suggested that gender may further influence this relationship, but not all studies have replicated these differences.In recent disease modification trials, APOE effects have been more pronounced. In the AN1792 active vaccination trial 6% of patients developed an autoimmune meningoencephalitis characterized radiologically by patchy vasogenic edema [11]. Although there was only minimal evidence of clinical efficacy, there was convincing neuropathological evidence of amyloid plaque clearing [12], but also a striking increase in cerebrovascular amyloid and associated microhemorrhages [13]. Bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has caused similar vasogenic changes that are three times and seven times more prevalent in e4 heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively, compared with e4 noncarriers [14], but amyloid-ligand positron emission tomography evidence of treatment efficacy seems to be no different between APOE subgroups [15]. These findings have prompted changes to ongoing trials so that e4 carriers now receive only the lowest doses of bapineuzumab.","Returning to our first question, there is strong evidence that APOE genotype influences the accuracy of diagnosis, age of symptomatic onset, and rate of disease progression both preclinically (relevant for prevention strategies) and during the MCI stage. Whether or not they are related to APOE genotype, clinical variants need to be handled separately because outcome measures designed for typical patients will be less sensitive to variant syndromes. Perhaps most importantly, APOE e4 carriers are at greater risk of immunotherapy-induced meningoencephalitis and microhemorrhages, and this has already prompted changes in study design. As for clinical practice, currently, the principles underlying dementia treatment are governed by managing symptoms and the drugs used are selected regardless of APOE genotype. Whether or not they might work less well in e4 carriers remains a question, but seems less relevant since there are no better options to offer yet. As we enter the era of personalized medicine, and with the further development of new treatments, that could certainly change, but until APOE or any other genomic signature influences choice of optimal therapy, treatment will remain tailored to symptoms."
5,Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for TTR-FAP in Portugal,"Portuguese Familial Amyloidotic Polyneurophaty (FAP) (OMIM #105210) is a rare systemic amyloidosis characterized by a progressive, autonomic and sensory-motor neuropathy. FAP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently one of the options available for couples at-risk to avoid disease transmission. The review the PGD cycles for TTR-FAP performed in the last 15 years in Portugal will be presented.",Embryos were biopsed at day 3 of development and diagnosis was initially performed using fluorescent PCR primers designed to amplify the p.Val50Met in exon 2 of the TTR gene and is currently done by multiplex PCR for the mutation detection and polymorphic markers.,"Two hundred and thirty-five clinical cycles were performed in 118 couples (74 with paternal and 44 with maternal mutation), with a mean number of 2 cycles per couple and a mean maternal age of 31.4 years old. The mean number of MII injected oocytes per cycle was 8.7. Fertilization and cleavage rates were 74.5% and 98.2%, respectively. Eighty-nine percent of embryos were biopsied (mean number = 5.8) and amplification was obtained in 94% with a ratio of normal versus mutated embryos of 1:1,3 (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, if only the cycles of paternal transmission were considered the ratio of normal versus mutated embryos was 1:1,03 (p=0,7018) whereas if the cycles of maternal transmission were analyzed the ratio of normal versus mutated embryos was 1:1,77 (p<0,0001). One hundred and fifty-eight cycles had embryo transfer (mean embryo number = 1.7) leading to 57 biochemical (36%) and 50 clinical pregnancies (32%) (45 term pregnancies, 3 ongoing pregnancies and 2 miscarriages). Three pregnancies correspond to frozen embryos transfers. Thirty-seven term pregnancies were singleton (mean gestational age = 38.4W; average weight at birth = 3093g), 7 were twins (mean gestational age = 34.5W; average weight at birth = 2310g) and one was a triplet pregnancy (two embryos transfer) (gestational age = 34W; average weight at birth = 1700g).",PGD for Portuguese type TTR-FAP is a well established procedure allowing the birth of unaffected children with a take-home baby rate similar to the one described in the literature.
