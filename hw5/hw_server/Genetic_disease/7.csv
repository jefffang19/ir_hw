0,No association of CDK5 genetic variants with Alzheimer's disease risk,"One of the neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of the microtubule-binding protein tau that is hyperphosphorylated [1]. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) has been implicated as one of the major protein kinases involved in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD [2], the activity of CDK5 has been shown to be higher in the prefrontal cortex of AD brains [3], and CDK5 has been described to be associated with all stages of neurofibrillary pathology in AD brains [4]. In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing CDK5 show a dramatic increase in hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau [5]. CDK5 is an interesting genetic target for association analysis of AD, and there are data available from 5 independent samples [6–9]. To facilitate comparisons with the Rotterdam Study that found a specific CDK5 haplotype influencing the risk for AD in a Dutch population, we examined the haplotype tagging SNPs identified by Arias-Vásquez et al. [8] (rs2069442, rs2069454, rs891507, rs2069459, and rs9278) and one additional htSNP (rs1549759), covering the complete genomic region of CDK5, in a large series of Spanish AD cases and controls.","The study included 408 AD patients (66% women; mean age at the time of study 76.8 years; SD 6.6; range 62–97 years; mean age at onset 73.5 years; SD 6.6; range 60–93 years) who met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [10]. All AD cases were defined as sporadic because their family history did not mention any first-degree relative with dementia; this information was obtained by direct interview of relatives. AD patients were consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurology, University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"", Santander, Spain, from January 1997 to December 2001. The large majority of patients were living in the community and had been referred by their general practitioner; few had been admitted from hospital wards or nursing home facilities. Control subjects were 444 unrelated individuals (68% women; mean age 80.7 years; SD 7.6; range 62–100 years) randomly selected from a nursing home. These subjects had complete neurological and medical examinations that showed that they were free of significant illness and had Mini Mental State Examination scores of 28 or more, which were verified by at least one subsequent annual follow-up assessment. The controls arose from the same base population as the cases. The AD and control samples were Caucasians originating from a homogeneous population in a limited geographical area in Northern Spain. All patients and controls were ascertained to have parents and grandparents born in Northern Spain to ensure ethnicity. Consequently, possible confounding effects of the inclusion in the study of members of different ethnic groups have been minimized.Blood samples were taken after written informed consent had been obtained from the subjects or their representatives. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"". Genotyping of CDK5 (rs9278, rs2069459, rs891507, rs2069454, rs1549759, and rs2069442) polymorphism was performed by a Taq-Man single-nucleotide-polymorphism assay (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) and an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). APOE genotyping was performed by amplification of the 4th exon of the APOE gene by PCR with biotinylated primers, followed by reverse hybridization on nitrocellulose strips, using the INNO-LIPA ApoE assay (Innogenetics NV, Ghent, Belgium).Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was calculated for the 6 htSNPs genotypes in the control population using Pearson's χ2 statistics. We assessed pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the 6 htSNPs by D' and r2 statistics. Haplotype reconstruction and their frequencies in cases and controls were estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm. Pearson's χ2 statistics were performed to compare allele distribution of the patients and control for each htSNP. Haplotype frequencies were also assessed using Pearson's χ2 using Haploview 3.32 software http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview. Rare haplotypes (total frequency < 0.05) were excluded from the analysis.","In control groups, no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found for any of the 6 htSNPs (p values ranging from 0.15 to 0.71). As shown in Table 1, the distribution of the allele and genotype frequencies of the CDK5 htSNPs did not differ significantly between either un-stratified or APOE-stratified AD and control groups. Haplotype distributions were not significantly different between cases and controls in the overall analysis or after stratification by APOE ε4 allele (Table 2). There were no major differences in allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies of CDK5 polymorphisms in our total sample associated to either age or gender subgroups (data not shown).Table 1 Distribution of CDK5 polymorphisms in patients and controls stratified by APOE ε4 alleleFull size table

","In a series of 85 early onset AD patients from Sweden and 104 early onset patients from the Netherlands, Rademakers et al. [6] studied five tagging SNPs (rs2069442, rs2069454, rs891507, rs2069459, and rs9278), observing a two times increased AD risk in both patient samples for carriers of the CDK5 rs2069454 C allele. Assessing the association between these previously described htSNPs in the CDK5 gene and late onset AD in a Dutch case-control series, Arias-Vásquez et al. [8] observed a 1.8-fold (p = 0.001) increased risk of AD for carriers of the GG genotype of SNP rs2069442 in the CDK5 gene in non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele; in addition the CDK5 haplotype (GGGGG) composed of 5'UTR (rs2069442), intron 5 (rs2069454), intron 9 (rs891507 and rs2069459) and 3'UTR (rs9278) was significantly associated with AD (OR = 1.21, p = 0.05) in non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele. We genotyped the same variants in CDK5 as described by Arias-Vásquez et al, but we were not able to confirm these results, although we had enough power (80%) to detect an OR as low as 1.43 for an increased risk effect of CDK5 haplotype in APOE ε4 allele non-carriers. Our failure to replicate the main finding of Arias-Vásquez et al. could be caused by many factors. We might have not been able to detect the effect due to the fact that in the original study the GGGGG haplotype conferred only a modest risk (OR = 1.2), and the possibility of a type 2 error (false-negative) must be taken into account. Another possibility is genetic heterogeneity between our sample sets and those of the original study. In two independent studies conducted in USA and Netherlands [7], and Canada [9], respectively, the CDK5 rs2069454 and rs891507 genetic variants were not associated with AD. AlzGene database http://www.alzgene.org reported meta-analyses of these two CDK5 polymorphisms, both of which are studied here, without any significant effects (based on nearly 10,000 cases and controls) [11]."
1,Association of genetic variants in the promoter region of genes encoding p22phox (CYBA) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and renal disease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) represents one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. Unlike diabetic retinopathy, with up to 80% incidence in diabetes patients with more than 20 years' diagnoses [1], DN affects approximately one third of type 1 diabetes patients during their lifetime, at times irrespective of the glycemic control [2]. These findings taken together with results of familial studies [3], point to the existence of genetic susceptibility to the renal lesions caused by chronic hyperglycemia.Oxidative stress is currently recognized as a major pathogenic factor of cellular damage caused by hyperglycemia, being considered the final common pathway through which hyperglycemia-related pathways (polyol, advanced glycation end products, protein kinase C and hexosamine) can trigger the chronic complications of diabetes [4]. NOX/NADPH oxidases catalyse NADPH-dependent reduction of O2 to O2
•-, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4 are isoforms expressed in the kidney [5] whose activation requires association with subunit p22phox, encoded by the CYBA gene. Increased expression of p22phox was described in animal models of DN [6].Acting in the opposite direction, glutathione (GSH) is one of the main endogenous antioxidants whose plasmatic concentrations were reported to be reduced in diabetes patients [7]. GSH synthesis requires the glutamate-cysteine ligase enzyme (γ-GCL) in the first and rate-limiting step for its production. This enzyme is a heterodimer composed by a heavy catalytic subunit, encoded by the GCLC gene, as well as a light regulatory subunit [8]. GSH regulates ROS concentrations via reactions catalyzed by glutathione peroxidases (GPX), such as the plasmatic GPX (GPX3) [9].Given the role of oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of diabetic complications, we examined the association between the presence of renal disease in type 1 diabetes patients and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of three genes related to cellular redox balance: (1) -675 T → A in CYBA (unregistered), where the T allele is associated with higher phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity [10], (2) -129 C → T in GCLC (rs17883901), where the T allele determines a lower promoter activity [8] and -65 T → C in GPX3 (rs8177412), where the C allele is present in a haplotype associated with a lower promoter transcriptional activity [9].","A total of 401 type 1 diabetes patients and 188 non-diabetic subjects age and gender matched were included between October 2004 and February 2011. The study was carried out in compliance with the Institutional Ethics Committee and the Declaration of Helsinki, with informed consent being given to each participant. Inclusion criterion was diabetes duration ≥ 10 years. DN status was determined by measurements of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER). Patients presenting persistent macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/g of creatinine or > 200 μg/min) or proteinuria (> 500 mg/24 h) were classified as having overt DN (n = 104) and patients without overt DN (n = 196) presented persistent normoalbuminuria. Patients with microalbuminuria were excluded from this analysis. Patients were also stratified according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-estimated GFR: ≥ 60 mL (n = 265) or < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 136). All patients presenting autoimmune diseases and HIV or HCV infection were excluded from the study, as well as patients with overt DN or GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who did not present diabetic retinopathy.Hypertension was defined as blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions or use of antihypertensive drugs. UAER was measured in 24-h urine samples by immunoturbidimetry and ACR was measured in spot urine samples using nephelometry, in at least two samples collected over the preceding 6 months. HbA1C, creatinine, triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol were measured as described [11].
GCLC -129 C → T (rs17883901; location 6:53410037) was determined by PCR-RFLP as previously described [8], GPX3 -65 T → C (rs8177412; location 5: 150400087) was genotyped by sequencing of PCR products (5' CCTGACTTCCACCTCTCTGC 3' and 5' CGCCCTCCCCGCTGCTCCTC 3') on an ABI3130DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). CYBA -675 A → T (unregistered; location 16:88718096) [10] was genotyped by PCR using specific primers (sense: 5'-GCGCTGGCTCACCAC-3' and antisense: 5'-ACTGGGAAAGCACAGAATGCA-3') and fluorescent-labelled probes (VIC: 5'-CCTCCCGAACCCAGG-3' and FAM: 5'-CCTCCCGTACCCAGG-3') (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems). Genotyping success rates were 100% for the GCLC and GPX3 SNPs and 98% for the CYBA SNP. We achieved 100% concordance in the analysis of duplicate samples (15% of total) for all SNPs (the SNP evaluated by RFLP was double genotyped by direct sequencing).Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 8.0 (JMP SAS Institute Inc). Pearson's χ2 test was used to compare genotype frequencies between non-diabetic and diabetic groups. Mann-Whitney and Fisher's χ2 test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Magnitude of association was estimated using odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR was estimated by logistic regression for possible confounders (sex, age at diagnosis, diabetes duration, hypertension, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and HbA1C). P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Power calculations were carried out with the CaTS power calculator [12] and the power of the study was > 80% to detect associations of SNPs (dominant model) with a minor allele frequency ≥ 0.11 and a genotype relative risk ≥ 1.6. Benjamini-corrected false-discovery rate was employed to control for multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) [13].","The distribution of genotypes was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all SNPs. No differences were found in the age and sex distribution and in the frequency of genotypes between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (Table 1). The characteristics of the patients according to GFR status are depicted in Table 2. Patients with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are older, present longer diabetes duration, higher frequency of hypertension and of use of lipid lowering drugs, higher plasmatic concentrations of triglycerides and lower plasmatic concentrations of HDL-cholesterol.Table 1 Frequency of CYBA - 657 T → A (unregistered), GCLC - 129 C → T (rs17883901) and GPX3 - 65 T → C (rs8177412) polymorphisms in type 1 diabetes patients and non-diabetic control subjects.Full size table

No statistically significant differences were found in frequency of the genotypes T/C+C/C of the SNP GPX3 rs8177412 between patients with and without overt DN (29.8% and 24%, respectively) and between patients with GFR < and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (28.4% and 24%, respectively) (data not shown).The characteristics of the patients according to the genotypes of SNPs CYBA -675 A → T and GCLC rs17883901 are depicted in Table 3. The frequency of overt DN was significantly lower in the group of patients carrying CYBA genotypes T/A+A/A (20%) than in the group carrying the T/T genotype (36.2%) (p = 0.0398) but this association lost significance if corrected for MHT. The frequency of GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was also significantly lower in the group of patients carrying genotypes T/A+A/A (18.7%) than in the group carrying the T/T genotype (35.3%) (p = 0.0143). Regarding GCLC rs17883901, the frequency of GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was significantly higher in the group of patients carrying genotypes C/T+T/T (47.1%) than in the group carrying the C/C genotype (31.1%) (p = 0.0082). Both associations remained significant after correction for MHT. GCLC C/T+T/T genotypes were also associated with a significantly lower age at diabetes diagnosis (11 years old) in comparison to the C/C genotype (13 years old) (p = 0.0073) and with a higher frequency of use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (31.4% versus 18.8%, respectively; p = 0.0164).Table 3 Characteristics of type 1 diabetes patients according to the genotypes of CYBA -675 T → A (unregistered) or GCLC rs17883901 SNPs.Full size table
Logistic regression analysis with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as dependent variable identified the presence of at least one A allele of the CYBA SNP as an independent protection factor against decreased GFR (OR = 0.38, CI95% 0.14-0.88, p = 0.0354) and the presence of at least one T allele of the GCLC rs17883901 SNP as an independent risk factor for decreased GFR (OR = 2.40, CI95% 1.27-4.56, p = 0.0068). Longer diabetes duration, arterial hypertension and higher triglycerides concentrations were also identified as independent risk factors for a GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 4).Table 4 Logistic regression analyses with glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as dependent variable.Full size table
","In the current study, the presence of at least one A allele in -675 T → A SNP and at least one T allele in rs17883901 located, respectively, at the promoter region of the CYBA and GCLC genes modulate the risk for decreased GFR in type 1 diabetes patients even after adjusting for other risk factors.The participation of NOX-derived ROS in DN has been previously demonstrated in experimental models of diabetes [6, 14] while the contribution of genes coding proteins belonging to the NADPH system to genetic predisposition for DN has been little explored. The association of one CYBA SNP (+242 C → T [rs4673]) with overt DN was previously demonstrated in type 1 diabetes patients [15]. We evaluated a different functional SNP,-675 T → A and the proportion of patients with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was significantly lower in the group of patients carrying genotypes T/A+A/A. Moreno et al. have previously associated the T allele of this SNP with essential hypertension and with a higher phagocytic NADPH-dependent O2
•- production in Spanish subjects and they hypothesized that the presence of the T allele increases p22phox transcription by interfering with binding of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) [10]. Because high glucose is able to increase expression of HIF-1α in the glomeruli of animal models of diabetes in conditions of normoxia [16], it is plausible that patients harboring the T/A+A/A genotypes do not present an increase in p22phox transcription rate as high as that observed in patients harboring the T/T genotype in response to HIF-α, which could result in lower ROS generation in conditions of hyperglycemia.The T allele of the GCLC rs17883901 SNP was previously associated to myocardial infarction in the Japanese [8] and Italian [17] populations and to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in a Brazilian series [18]. No previous studies have associated this SNP with any of the chronic microangiopathic complications of DM, but a study performed in a Swedish population of type 1 diabetes patients found that the C/T genotype was associated with higher anti-GAD autoantibody concentrations compared to the C/C genotype. The authors suggested that this SNP influences anti-GAD levels and perhaps diabetes age at onset [19]. The results of the present study also suggest an effect of this SNP on the age at diabetes onset since age at diabetes diagnosis among those harboring the C/T+T/T genotypes was significantly lower than among patients with the C/C genotype.Mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of type 1 diabetes patients carrying the T allele of the GCLC rs17883901 SNP toward the presence of decreased GFR may be the inability to increase concentrations of the enzyme γ-CGS during oxidative stress, which would result in lower production of GSH and thus, increased susceptibility of cells exposed to chronic hyperglycemia to ROS-induced lesions.This study widens the spectrum of candidate genes for DN belonging to oxidant and antioxidant pathways and corroborates the assumption that therapeutic approaches to improve antioxidant defenses may be a strategy to prevent or delay chronic diabetic complications. However the present findings should be interpreted in the context of limitations of cross-sectional studies and must be validated in larger populations sorted by different phenotypes of renal impairment to further evaluated if these genetic variants are more involved with the decline of GFR than with development of proteinuria or if the current findings only reflect the larger number of patients stratified by GFR than by albuminuria status, given that in this latter analysis, patients presenting normoalbuminuria had been excluded. Besides, the ethnic admixture that characterizes the Brazilian population may be a source of false-positive associations. Ninety percent of the patients of the present study defined themselves as Caucasoid, 7.3% as African descendants and 2.7% as Asian descendants, but previous genetic studies demonstrated that color, as determined by physical evaluation, is a poor predictor of genomic African ancestry in Brazilians [20]. Nevertheless type 1 DM is predominantly a disease of Caucasians and of populations with a great Caucasian genetic admixture [21] and the genotypic frequencies of the GCLC and CYBA SNPs observed in this Brazilian sample are similar to those reported in the representative Caucasian samples genotyped in the HapMap CEU and in the previous study of the CYBA SNP in a Spanish series [10], respectively."
2,Genetic variability of histamine receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease,"Histamine is involved in neuronal degeneration [1] and neurotoxicity [2]. Changes in the morphology and increase in density of histaminergic fibers in the substantia nigra have been described in the brain of PD patients [3]. It has been shown that histamine causes selective damage in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra with induction of inflammatory signal processes [4]. Among patients with PD, blood histamine levels [5] and the concentration of the histamine metabolite pros-methylimidazoleatic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid are increased [6], and recently we described the association of genotypes leading to high histamine metabolism with increased risk to develop PD [7]. Taken together, these findings suggest that modulation of brain histamine may be related to PD, but the mechanisms underlying such modulation remains unknown.Changes in the density and expression of histamine receptors (HRH) have been detected in PD patients [8]. HRH antagonists bring about improvements in motor and other symptoms [9, 10], thus suggesting that HRH play a role in the clinical response of PD patients. Since genes coding for HRH are polymorphic it may be speculated that variations in genes coding for HRH could be related to PD.Three receptors, HRH1 through HRH3 are present in the human brain. HRH1 and HRH2 have been localized to caudate and putamen, and HRH3 is most abundant in the basal ganglia, the highest density being observed in the globus pallidus [11]. The predominant location of HRH2 and HRH3 in the basal ganglia suggests that these receptors could play a role in motor functions [11]. In addition, it has recently been shown that a protective role against toxic-induced neurodegeneration is linked to expression of histamine receptors [12]. Taking together the alteration in histaminergic transmission observed in patients with PD, the fact that brain histamine receptors are believed to regulate the release of brain histamine and other neurotransmitters [13–16] and the putative role of histamine receptors in motor functions, it can be speculated that individuals carrying mutated histamine receptors may show altered susceptibility to develop PD.Studies involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HRH in PD patients are scarce and controversial. HRH1 and HRH2 are polymorphic due to genetic alterations, whereas no variant HRH3 alleles have been described so far, with the exception of a rare Ala280Val described in a patient suffering from Shy-Drager syndrome which was not identified in other subjects [17]. The HRH1 gene, located in chromosome 3p25, shows diverse SNPs, and one of these, designated as rs2067470, located in exon 3 T1522C, causes the amino acid substitution Leu449Ser [18]. Other HRH1 variant alleles causing amino acid changes at positions 19, 270, 308 and 349 have been described [19], but none of these have been identified in Caucasian individuals [20]. Among the SNPs mapped to the HRH2 gene, located in chromosome 5q35.2, in addition to the variant HRH2 allele causing the Asn217Asp amino acid change, initially described by Orange et al [21, 22] but not confirmed by independent studies [19, 23], other variant HRH2 alleles have been described, although none of these cause amino acid changes [19, 24]. Only one SNP, designated as rs2067474, a G-1018A transition located in an enhancer element of the gene promoter, occurs with a relevant allele frequency [18].It can be hypothesized that genetic variations in histamine receptors may modulate the risk to develop PD because polymorphisms at histamine receptors are likely to have relevant functional effects, although the functional characterization for histamine receptor polymorphisms has not been completed so far. For instance, it has been shown that the HRH1 Leu449Ser is related to the risk to develop schizophrenia. Although the mechanism involved in such association remains to be elucidated [18], the presence of serine, which is more hydrophillic and reactive than leucine, is likely to induce functional changes in the receptor. The other SNPs tested at the HRH1 gene, namely Gly270Glu, induces a change from a small to a medium-size and acidic amino acid. The HRH2 SNP occurs in an enhancer element of the gene promoter [23]. It is likely that the HRH2 variant located in the promoter may induce changes in the expression of receptors. This study is aimed to test the hypothesis that genetic alterations in histamine receptors, either causing changes in the expression or functional alterations related to amino acid substitutions, may cause an increased risk to develop PD. The HRH gene products may have functional relevance to PD as they encode histamine receptors, and hence may influence histamine effects on CNS. In an attempt to identify factors related to PD risk, we mapped common SNPs in the HRH1 and HRH2 genes in patients with PD and healthy subjects.","All the participants were Caucasian Spanish individuals and were included in the study after giving informed consent. We studied a cohort of 195 patients suffering from sporadic PD who presented to the neurological service in la Princesa Hospital, Madrid, Spain. All consecutive patients diagnosed by consultant neurologists according to the criteria recommended by Hughes et al. [25] were requested to participate, and all of them agreed. Healthy subjects (n = 231) were randomly selected among medical students, and university and hospital staff. A medical examination was performed to identify subjects in good health. Over 95% of the healthy subjects propositioned agreed to participate. All lived in the same areas as the patients (Madrid and surrounding areas). The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the hospitals involved in the study. Table 1 summarizes the demographic data of the subgroups analyzed in the study. To test for a putative age-related difference in the frequency for the SNPs analyzed, we examined the frequencies of HRH variant alleles in a group of 41 healthy Spanish nonagenarians free of neurodegenerative diseases who had participated in previous genetics studies [26].Table 1 Characteristics of the individuals included in the study.Full size table
Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral leukocytes and purified according to standard procedures. The presence of the SPNs was investigated by amplification-restriction and electrophoresis in agarose gels. In order to prevent false-positive or negative findings due to lack of endonuclease digestions, the detection methods were designed including both constitutive and polymorphic restriction sites for the two SNPs analyzed. The analysis of the HRH1 Gly270Glu rs7651620 polymorphism was carried out after the amplification of a gene fragment of exon 3 by using the following primers (based on the published human HRH1 sequence Gene Bank Accession No. NM_000861): TTC ATG CAG CAG ACC TCG GTG and AGG CCC TGC TCA TCT GTC TTG. After an initial step of 3 minutes at 94°C, PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles of 25 sec at 94°C, 1 minute at 56°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, and a final extension period of 5 minutes at 72°C. The 512 bp PCR product contains a constitutive restriction site for the endonuclease HinfI, and a variant-allele specific restriction site. After endonuclease digestion the wild-type gene yielded fragments of 259 and 253 bp, whereas the mutated gene was digested to fragments of 259, 205 and 48 bp. No variant alleles for the rs7651620 polymorphism were detected among PD patients or control subjects.The analysis of the HRH1 Leu449Ser rs2067470 polymorphism was carried out after the amplification of a gene fragment by using the primers (based on the published human HRH1 sequence Gene Bank Accession No. NM_000861): CGAACGGACTCAGATACCACC and CTGGCAACACACAGGCCTTC. After an initial step of 3 minutes at 94°C, PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles of 25 sec at 94°C, 1 minute at 55°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, and a final extension period of 5 minutes at 72°C. The 470 bp PCR product was sequenced as follows: The sequencing mixture contained 2 μl of the purified PCR products and 60 nM of the corresponding primer, and was assembled according the instructions of the manufacturer (dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems). Automated sequencing was carried out in an Abi Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing conditions were as described elsewhere [27].Regarding the G-1018A transition in the HRH2 gene, the following primers (based on the HRH2 gene sequence Gene Bank Accession No. AB023486) were used: ACA GCC CGT GGC TAA GAA TGG and AGA AGG GAG GCA GGA TGC AAG. After an initial step of 3 minutes at 94°C, PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles of 25 sec at 94°C, 1 minute at 62°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, and a final extension period of 5 minutes at 72°C. The amplified 574 bp contained three constitutive restriction sites for the endonuclease BsuRI, yielding fragments of 262, 148, 125 and 39 bp. One of the restriction sites was lost in the variant allele which after digestion yielded fragments of 410, 125 and 39 bp. Control DNA samples with known sequences that were wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous for every SPN analyzed were ran in parallel to ensure accurate genotyping.The statistical power with the sample size finally involved in the study (n = 195) was 98.5% for the HRH1 variant allele and 98.1% for the for the HRH2 variant allele (unilateral association). The frequencies for the HRH were estimated by counting genes and calculating sample proportions. Case-control analyses were performed with the χ 2 statistics or Fisher exact test, each when appropriate. The association between HRH polymorphisms and gender or age of onset of PD was estimated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). To assess whether allelic variants influence synergically upon the age of onset of PD, subjects were classified as carriers and noncarriers of nonsynonymous SNPs. The above-cited test was used for the comparison of carriers and noncarriers. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether HRH gene polymorphisms were correlated with gender-related risk or age of onset. Association was expressed as OR with 95% CI. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10.07 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill. USA). Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the use of Bonferroni's test. A two-tailed p value equal to or less than 0.01 was considered significant.","The fragments of both histamine receptor genes containing the polymorphisms to be analyzed were amplified in all participants, and in all cases the products of gene amplifications had identical sizes. Table 2 shows the genotypes of PD patients and controls. Individuals carrying the HRH1 SNP were identified among PD patients, but not in the control group. Regarding HRH2 genotypes, a lower frequency for variant alleles was observed among PD patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. Both patients and controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the HRH1 and HRH2 genotypes, with expected frequencies for subjects with the wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous genotype as follows: HRH1 genotype = 99.0%, 1.0% and 0% for patients and 100.0%, 0% and 0% for healthy subjects; HRH2 genotype = 92.9%, 6.9% and 0% for patients and 90.3%, 9.5% and 0.2% for control subjects. These expected frequencies are close to the actual frequencies shown in Table 2. To test for putative age-related differences for allele frequencies in the control population, we analyzed both polymorphisms in nonagenarians. The allele frequencies among nonagenarian subjects were identical to those present in the group of 231 healthy individuals: 0% and 4.9% of variant alleles for the HRH1 and HRH2 polymorphisms, respectively. No gender or age-related differences in genotypes or allele frequencies were observed in the control group.Table 2 Histamine receptor polymorphisms in patients with PD and healthy controls.Full size table
Patients were subdivided into groups according to gender and age of onset of symptoms. Table 3 shows that variant HRH1 alleles are observed among women with late-onset PD. However, because of the low frequency for these SNPs, the results were not statistically significant for multiple comparison values. No major differences regarding gender or age of onset were observed among PD patients with regard to the HRH2 polymorphism.Table 3 Histamine receptor polymorphisms according to gender and age of onset of PD. PD patients were subdivided in groups according to age of onset (under or over the median age) and according to gender.Full size table
","The etiology of idiopathic PD is complex and poorly understood, although epidemiological data and animal models involve both genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of the disease [28–31]. Initially promising findings of genomewide association analyses [32] were not confirmed by further studies [33–37]. Nevertheless, evidence of an inheritance role is still supported by the fact that 6% to 33% of PD patients have relatives with the disease [38–41]. In the present study we investigated the role of polymorphisms of histamine-receptors in PD. The rationale for the study is that histamine seems to play a role in PD and that among the three histamine receptors present in the brain, two of them, namely HRH1 and HRH2 are polymorphic.It should be emphasized that in the present study patients and controls were not age-matched. Nevertheless, we observed that age-related differences in allele frequencies do not occur in healthy subjects. It cannot be ruled out that some control individuals would eventually develop PD. Nevertheless, the possibility that some healthy subject would eventually develop PD in the lapse between the mean age of controls and the mean age of cases is negligible given the prevalence of PD (<1%) at ages less than 68 years in the studied population [42], and therefore the differences in the mean age of patients and controls should not influence the findings obtained in the present study. The HRH1 variant allele frequency in our study population is extremely low. We have demonstrated the occurrence of the Leu449Ser HRH1 amino acid polymorphism in two Caucasian women with PD, but this variant allele was not detected in 231 healthy subjects. Such low frequency is in contrast with the allele frequency initially reported for the variant allele [43], but it agrees with the absence of such variant allele in 58 European individuals that participated in the Hap-Map project [44]. The HRH2 variant allele frequency in our population study, as calculated from Table 2, is 3.5% in PD patients and 4.9% in healthy subjects. Such frequency is lower as that initially reported [23]. Although the occurrence of ethnic differences between different Caucasian subjects such as Swedish, French or Spanish individuals regarding HRH variant alleles has not been investigated in detail such differences may occur, as it has been demonstrated for common SNPs on genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes [45]. Another possible explanation for differences in HRH2 allele frequencies between the present study and that by Ito et al. [23] is related to sampling. In our study we analyzed 231 unrelated healthy subjects, whereas in the study by Ito et al. [23] authors analyze only 53 Swedish subjects and 52 French subjects. In addition, the Swedish subjects such study belonged to 15 families and therefore these were not unrelated subjects. The combination of the low sample size and the fact that some participants are relatives may cause a bias in allele frequencies. In addition, it should be mentioned that our findings agree with the presence of such variant allele with a frequency of 4.2% in 60 European individuals that participated in the Hap-Map project [46], which is very close to the frequency of 4.9% reported here (Table 3). In summary, the findings obtained in the present study do not support the high allele frequencies initially reported for the variant alleles analyzed [23, 43]. The design of the amplification-restriction method including constitutive and polymorphic restriction sites and the use of sequencing in the present study ensures accurate genotyping. This adds to the increasing evidences indicating that several variant HRH alleles are actually rarer than initially expected [19, 23]."
3,DYRK1A genetic variants are not linked to Alzheimer's disease in a Spanish case-control cohort,"Abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation has been suggested as being one of the central events in the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are one of the characteristic neuropathological lesions found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains [1]. Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) phosphorylates tau in vitro at the Thr212 residue [2], which is hyperphosphorylated in AD brains, and a significant increase in the amount of phosphor-Thr212-tau is also found in the brains of transgenic mice that overexpress human DYRK1A [3]. In addition, transgenic mice bearing a triple tau mutation and expressing hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons of the hippocampus and neocortex show increased expression of DYRK1A in individual neurons in the same regions [4]. Moreover, DYRK1A accumulates in NFTs in brains of subjects with sporadic AD and in subjects with trisomy of chromosome 21 and Down syndrome (DS) [5]. The increase dosage of DYRK1A in DS brain due to trisomy of chromosome 21 correlates to an increase in three microtubule-binding domain repeats-tau level [6], which on abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau results in neurofibrillary degeneration [7]. All this data postulates a role for DYRK1A as an interesting genetic target for association analysis of AD. Although genetic markers of the DYRK1A region were not found associated to AD in recent genome-wide association studies [8–11], Kimura et al. [12] scanned througt chromosome 21 to assess genetic associations with late-onset AD and found that DYRK1A showed the highest significant association with AD risk in the Japanese population. In addition, these authors suggested that DYRK1A could be a key molecule bridging between β-amyloid production and tau phosphorylation in AD [12]. In this report we sought to replicate this genetic association in the Spanish population.","The study included 634 AD patients (65% women; mean age at study 75.9 years; SD 8.0; range 61-109 years; mean age at onset 72.8 years; SD 7.9; range 60-108 years) who met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [13]. All AD cases were defined as sporadic because their family history did not mention any first-degree relative with dementia. AD patients were recruited from the Departments of Neurology of University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"" (Santander, Spain), and Hospital ""La Paz"" (Madrid, Spain). The large majority of patients were living in the community and had been referred by their general practitioner; few had been admitted from hospital wards or nursing home facilities. Control subjects were 733 unrelated individuals (65% women; mean age 78.7 years; SD 9.4; range 60-104 years) randomly selected from nursing homes. These subjects had complete neurologic and medical examinations that showed that they were free of significant illness and had Mini Mental State Examination scores of 28 or more (corrected for age), which were verified by at least one subsequent annual following-up assessment. The controls arose from the same base population as the cases. The AD and control samples were Caucasians originating from a limited geographical area in northern Spain (Santander) and from the central area of Spain (Madrid).Blood samples were taken after written informed consent had been obtained from the subjects or their representatives. The study was approved by the ethical committees of the University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"" and the Hospital ""La Paz"". Genotyping of DYRK1A (rs11701483, rs2835740, rs1137600, rs2835761, rs2835762, rs2154545 and rs8132976) polymorphism was performed by a Taq-Man single-nucleotide-polymorphism assay (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) and an ABI PRISM 7000 or 7900HT sequence detection systems (Applied Biosystems). We used data from the HapMap project http://www.hapmap.org to select the 7 htSNPs capturing 86% of DYRK1A genetic variability in Caucasians. SNPs were chosen among those with minor allele frequencies ≥ 5% using Haploview v3.2 software http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview with an r2 threshold of 0.8. The location of SNPs in DYRK1A gene used in the present study is described in Figure 1. APOE genotyping was performed by amplification of the 4th exon of the APOE gene by PCR with biotinylated primers, followed by reverse hybridization on nitrocellulose strips, using the INNO-LIPA ApoE assay (Innogenetics NV, Ghent, Belgium), or by HhaI restriction analysis.Figure 1

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was calculated for the 7 htSNPs genotypes in the control population using Pearson's χ2 statistics. We assessed pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the 7 htSNPs by D' and r2 statistics. Haplotype reconstruction and their frequencies in cases and controls were estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm. Pearson's χ2 statistics were performed to compare allele distribution of the patients and control for each htSNP. Haplotype frequencies were also assessed using Pearson's χ2 using Haploview 3.32 software http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview. Rare haplotypes (total frequency < 0.05) were excluded from the analysis.","In control groups, no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found for any of the 7 htSNPs. As shown in Table 1, the distribution of the allele and genotype frequencies of the DYRK1A htSNPs did not differ significantly between either un-stratified or APOE-stratified AD and control groups. Figure 1 shows the pattern of pair wise LD, measured in terms of D' coefficient, between the 7 chosen htSNPs. One block was found consisting of SNPs rs11701483, rs2835740, rs1137600, rs2835761, rs2835762 and rs2154545. When we estimated the haplotype frequencies in this haplotype block, we found that the haplotype distribution did not differ significantly between AD cases and controls (Table 2). There were no major differences in allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies of DYRK1A polymorphisms in our total sample associated to either age or gender subgroups (data not shown).Table 1 Distribution of DYRK1A polymorphisms in patients and controls stratified by APOE ε4 alleleFull size table

","In a series of 374 Japanese AD patients and 375 population-based controls, Kimura et al. [12] studied eight tagging SNPs (rs8126696, rs2251085, rs2835740, rs10470178, rs11701810, rs1024294, rs2835773 and rs2835774) located from 30 kb upstream of exon 1 to exon 13, observing a three times increased AD risk for carriers of the DYRK1A rs2835740 CC genotype (OR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.72-5.19, p = 0.001), and haplotype analysis indicated that two haplotypes had significantly different frequencies between AD and controls. These authors showed that the expression of DYRK1A mRNA was elevated in the hippocampus of AD patients, coinciding with another report of increased DYRK1A immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients [4]. All the tagging SNPs analyzed in our study are located in a single block that does not cover the whole gene (captures 86% of DYRK1A genetic variability), but is the same haplotype block as described by Kimura et al. in their Japanese cohort. It could have been a great interest to identify possible DYRK1A genetic association using tagging SNPs located in haplotype blocks flanking the block illustrated in Figure 1; however, our main objective was to study the most strongly associated SNP rs2835740 (intron 3) of the original paper suggesting DYRK1A as a putative gene causing AD [12], and, in addition, we genotyped other SNPs in intron 3 (rs11701483, rs1137600 and rs2835761), intron 4 (rs2835762) and intron 10 (rs2154545 and rs8132976). In contrast with the findings of Kimura et al., we did not find any genetic association. Our failure to replicate the main finding of Kimura et al. could be caused by several factors. The possibility of a type 2 error (false-negative) must be taken in account, but we had enough power (98%) to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 at disease allele frequencies of approximately 0.15. Another possibility is genetic heterogeneity between our sample sets and those of the original study. While DYRK1A rs2835740 revealed evidence for association in Japanese samples, this SNP was not associated with AD in our Caucasian sample, and independent replication studies are needed in this gene to verify or refute the finding here and to extend it to other ethnic groups."
4,Caspase-1 genetic variation is not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk,"A chronic inflammatory process might contribute to the neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), by overexpression of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other inflammatory molecules in activated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques [1]. Increased expression of IL-1 in AD has been implicated in the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the spread of these neuropathological lesions across cerebral cortical regions, and the accompanying neuronal cell injury and loss [2]. The predominant β isoform of IL-1 is generated from an inactive precursor through the action of caspase-1 (CASP1), a cystein protease formerly called IL-1β converting enzyme (ICE), and CASP1 expression appears to be significantly increased in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with AD [3–5]. In addition, CASP1 messenger RNA expression has been closely associated with neurofibrillary tangle and, to a lesser extent, amyloid plaque density [4]. Several studies have reported associations between IL-1β genetic polymorphisms and AD, but findings from different studies have been controversial [6]. Although genetic markers of the CASP1 region were not found associated to AD in recent genome-wide association studies [7–10], Blankenberg et al. [11] sequenced the CASP1 gene in a case-control study of myocardial infarction (MI), and found that CASP1 genetic variation is associated with cardiovascular risk. The present study investigated the genetic variability of the CASP1 in relation to AD risk.","The study included 628 AD patients (65% women; mean age at study 75.8 years; SD 8.1; range 61-109 years; mean age at onset 72.7 years; SD 7.9; range 60-108 years) who met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [12].

As shown in Table 1, the distribution of the allele and genotype frequencies of the CASP1 htSNPs did not differ significantly between AD and control groups. The three CASP1 htSNPs were in complete LD with each other (with r2values close to 1.0) forming one block, and therefore, they exhibited a pattern of reduced haplotype diversity, with only four haplotypes captured that did not differ between AD and control groups (Table 2). Our analysis showed the expected association between the APOE ε4 allele and AD with an OR = 5.92 (95% CI = 4.60-7.62, p < 0.001) for carrying 1 or 2 copies of ε4 allele. There were no major differences in allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies of CASP1 polymorphisms in our total sample stratified for age, gender or APOE ε4 allele.Table 1 Distribution of caspase-1 polymorphisms in patients and controlsFull size table

","Increasing evidence indicates that IL-1 is involved in both development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk, and CASP1 might play a key role in the proatherogenic effects mediated by IL-1β [11]. Blankenberg et al. [11] investigated whether polymorphisms of the CASP1 gene might influence cardiovascular risk by analyzing cases with myocardial infarction (MI) and controls in British, French and German populations (n = 1774). They sequenced all exons, up to 100 bp of exon/intron junctions and up to 1 kb of 3'- and 5'-flanking sequences in CASP1, and found a block of 14 SNPs in complete LD covering the whole gene sequence: the CASP1 (G+7/in6A, rs501192) A allele was associated with a lower risk of MI in the British and German populations, and the same allele exhibited a borderline association with prospective cardiovascular death in the German population. Moreover, the CASP1 haplotype carrying the (G+7/in6A, rs501192) A allele was associated with a lower gene expression, supporting the existence of a functional polymorphism within the CASP1 gene. All the 3 tagging SNPs analyzed in our study are located in a single block that is the same haplotype block as described by Blankenberg et al. [11] in their European cohorts. Our main objective was to study the CASP1 rs501192 in intron 6 (G+7/in6A) suggesting CASP1 as a putative gene causing cardiovascular risk, and in addition, we genotyped other SNPs in intron 7 (rs556205 and rs530537). We failed to observe any allele, genotype or haplotype association with AD either in the whole study or in APOE ε4-stratified subgroups in the Spanish population.Variation in the CASP1 gene has been associated with cognitive function in elderly individuals with normal cognition [13]: subjects carrying the CASP1 rs580253 (exon 6) A allele and rs554344 (3'-UTR) C allele had significantly lower IL-1β production levels and performed better on all executive function tests at baseline and during follow-up compared to homozygous of the wild-type allele. One might postulate that carriers of these CASP1 genetic polymorphisms associated with better memory have a higher ""cognitive reserve"", and consequently, would have a lower predisposition to AD. Although both of these polymorphisms are in complete linkage disequilibrium with our studied CASP1 genetic variants, we did not find any genetic association with AD risk. Contradictory association of a memory-related genetic polymorphism with either healthy volunteers or AD patients is already well known; for example, the APOE ε4 allele is the only firmly established genetic susceptibility factor for sporadic AD, but it has been related to better memory in young, healthy volunteers [14]. Moreover, healthy young, middle aged and elderly carriers of the KIBRA rs17070145 T-allele exhibited a clear advantage in delayed episodic recall compared to individuals lacking the T-allele [15, 16], but a further study in a community AD population showed an association of the KIBRA rs17070145 T-allele with an increase AD risk [17], thus resulting inconsistent with previous findings in healthy subjects. Our negative results are probably not due to insufficient statistical power, because our sample size had enough power (86%) to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 at disease allele frequencies of 0.08. Because we only studied three htSNPs capturing 85% of CASP1 genetic variability in Caucasians, it might be argued that we have missed a hypothetical disease locus, which would have been detected by analysis of extended haplotypes. However, the complete LD across the CASP1 region in our study argues against this possibility; of note, two recent series in other Caucasian populations [11, 13] have also detected a complete LD covering the whole gene sequence. Despite supporting evidence for the biological role of CASP1 in AD exists, according to our data CASP1 genetic variation does not seem to be a risk factor for AD."
