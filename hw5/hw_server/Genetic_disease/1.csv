0,Lung tumors and non-malignant airways from patients with chronic lung inflammatory disease bear distinct genetic and epigenetic disruptions corresponding to metabolic processes involved in senescence and methylation,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disease associated with a 10-fold increased risk of lung cancer (LC), independent of smoking-status. Together these diseases contribute tremendously to mortality worldwide. Based on the notion that chronic inflammation forms a specific cancer-promoting environment; we hypothesized that COPD and non-COPD related lung tumors are molecularly distinct, and that these differences may yield promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Since genes that sustain high-level DNA and RNA alterations are likely selectively altered in tumor systems, we applied an integrative multi-omics analysis to lung tumors from COPD and non-COPD patients. To assess the potential clinical application of these findings, we examined the methylation status of COPD+LC specific genes in non-malignant airways from COPD patients w/LC.","Multi-omics profiling (copy number, DNA methylation and gene-expression) was performed on 76 tumor and non-malignant lung tissues using genome-wide array platforms. To identify genes/pathways which sustain high DNA and RNA level changes in tumors, we developed an algorithm to generate “Integrated Scores” for each gene based on magnitude of concomitant DNA and mRNA alterations. Integrated Scores were applied to all downstream analyses. COPD+LC specific genes were further assessed at the level of DNA methylation in airways from 25 COPD patients w/ and w/out LC.","Gene set and pathway enrichment analyses of genes frequently and differentially disrupted at both DNA and RNA levels in COPD tumors revealed enrichment of transcription factor gene sets involved in inflammation-related cancer, oxidative stress and smoking response; the most significant being PITX2 - a putative methylation biomarker in LC, previously associated with senescence gene networks in COPD.Pathways specifically disrupted in COPD tumors included those involved in inflammation (atherosclerosis, fibrosis and IL-17 signalling), DNA damage (14-3-3σ signalling) and synthesis of the methyl-donor, S-Adenosyl-methionine (SAM) - a critical cofactor involved in DNA and histone methylation. Five COPD+LC specific genes were also altered at the DNA methylation level in non-cancerous airways of COPD patients w/LC, including putative cancer epigenetic diagnostic biomarkers (CCNDBP1, HPGD), genes associated with oxidative response and COPD progression (PPARGC1A) and biosynthesis of SAM (MAT2B).",Genetic and epigenetic disruptions in lung tumors and small airways of patients with COPD and LC are distinct from those in corresponding tissues from patients w/COPD or LC alone. Genes altered in airways and involved in lung tumorigenesis in COPD patients may serve as clinically relevant markers for predicting LC or as targets for chemoprevention therapies.
1,Multidimensional evaluation in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease: genetic risk in Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegenerative dementias,"Late onset degenerative dementia is a growing, common and complex disorder in which the aetiological role played by environment and genes has not yet been established. A familial component is frequently ascertained in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (30% of first degree relatives affected) and also in Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) (40-60%).Early onset degenerative dementia has sometimes been recognized as caused by autosomal dominant genes, Presenilines (PS1 and PS2) and the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in AD, whereas in Frontotemporal dementia, two major genes (Microtubule Associated Protein tau, MAPT and Progranulin, PGRN) have also been identified.PS1 and MAPT mutations have been identified also in in very early onset patients (PS1 24 years [1], MAPT 22 years [2]), but also in late onset patients (PS1 78 years [3], MAPT 75 years [4] 87 years [5].To evaluate whether FAD and PGRN gene mutations account for late onset dementia.","Late onset familial dementia patients (onset >65 years) were regularly diagnosed in our centre.Diagnosis of dementia was performed through a detailed clinical assessment. The NINCDS-ADRDA and Lund-Manchester group criteria were used for diagnosis of AD and FTD respectively.Molecular screening of PS1, PS2, APP and PGRN genes was performed.",A PS2 Ser130Leu [6] and a novel PS2 Val139Met [7] mutations have been found in two late onset AD cases with onset at 83 and 76.Three more unrelated cases with an APP A713T mutation showed an onset age between 73 and 82 years [8]. A novel PGRN c1145insA has been identified in a FTD patient of 87 years belonging to a pedigree whose age at onset spans from 35 to 87 [5].,"Several autosomal dominant genes, either in AD or in FTD show an impact on late onset dementia. Heritability in late onset forms is now more evident, probably due to longer life survival. It is possible that mutation frequency has been underestimated due to the lack of wide genetic epidemiology. Genetic screening of FAD and PGRN genes might be recommended in familial late onset dementia as a part of Multidimensional evaluation."
2,"Genetic, metabolic and cellular factors influencing intracellular localization of the Wilson disease protein, ATP7B","Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper accumulation in liver and brain caused by mutations in the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B that affects 1 in 5000 live births. Under basal conditions, ATP7B protein localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) but traffics to vesicles in response to high copper. The purpose of the study is to identify genetic, metabolic and regulatory factors that regulate ATP7B function and localization to maintain normal copper homeostasis in cells. The study is divided into three parts, (a) Role of copper in normal protein folding and its ER exit, (b) Role of regulatory phosphorylation of ATP7B in its trafficking from TGN to vesicles (c) Interaction of ATP7B with regulatory proteins in its trafficking route.","Recombinant ATP7B (wt and variants), Confocal microscopy, NMR, Mass Spectroscopy, targeted knockdowns and other basic molecular biology techniques were utilized in this study.","We demonstrate that the polymorphism (producing the Gly875>Arg substitution) of ATP7B drastically alters the intracellular properties of ATP7B, while copper reverses the effects. Unlike the wtATP7B, the Arg875 variant is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and does not deliver copper to the TGN. Elevated copper rectifies the ATP7B-Arg875 phenotype. Analysis by NMR suggests that the ER retention of ATP7B-Arg875 is due to increased unfolding of the Arg875-containing.conserved domain (b) I characterized the sites of copper dependent regulatory phosphorylation of ATP7B critical in normal ATP7B trafficking. I discovered that a stretch of Ser (S340-343) at the N-terminal of ATP7B are the sites of phosphorylation and that phosphorylation alters the interaction between two conserved domains of ATP7B, causing the protein to attain a TGN exit conformation (c) Finally, while identifying the cellular machinery that is involved in trafficking of ATP7B vesicles, I found that MyosinVb is a major regulator of ATP7B trafficking. Presently, the molecular mechanism of the role of MyoVb in ATP7B trafficking is being investigated.",We characterized an ATP7B genetic variant (c.2623A/G) that is causal to the disease in Indians and is a non-disease causing SNP in Chinese population.
3,Elucidating the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic polymorphisms,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded a bounty of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or conditions associated with AD. Here, we will present several vignettes that illustrate approaches to use these results to clarify AD-related pathways and potential therapeutics.",SNPs of interest are identified from GWAS of AD or AD-related conditions such as cholesterol or rheumatoid arthritis; these latter SNPs are then evaluated for association with AD by using PLINK-mediated logistic regression analysis of AD GWAS data. Resulting AD-associated SNPs are then evaluated further for their impact on gene expression or splicing in human brain autopsy samples by real-time PCR and immunostaining. Candidate SNPs are evaluated for function by using in vitro studies in transfected cells.,"Results will be presented along three fronts. First, SNPs associated with both cholesterol and with AD (other than APOE SNPs) include SNPs within LIPC and HMGCR. In particular, the HMGCR SNP (rs3846662) is associated with the splicing efficiency of HMGCR exon 13; the allele that reduces exon 13 inclusion has been reported to reduce HMGCR activity and is associated with reduced AD risk. This SNP has also been associated with statin response. Overall, these results suggest that this SNP may modulate AD and the response of AD to statin treatment. Second, SNPs associated with rheumatoid arthritis are generally not associated with AD, reinforcing the hypothesis that rheumatoid arthritis is associated with reduced AD risk, perhaps because the associated long-term anti-inflammatory use. Third, the primary AD-associated SNP within CLU, rs11136000, is associated with the expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in the brain. Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce soluble clusterin protein in transfected cell studies. Since the protective allele of rs11136000 is associated with increased CLU1 expression, agents that upregulate CLU1 may reduce AD risk. Of particular interest, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) induce CLU1 robustly, suggesting that HDACI such as the widely used epilepsy drug valproic acid may have some utility in reducing AD risk. Lastly, we note that normalizing RNA measurements to correct for variation in cell-type within the brain fragments used for RNA preparation in these studies was critical to discerning SNP association with gene expression or splicing.","Although AD GWAS results have not yielded another AD risk factor with the impact of the APOE SNPs, they have succeeded in identifying “bottlenecks” in AD-related pathways that modulate AD risks. Hence, elucidating the actions associated with these SNPs by using a combination of bioinformatics, human tissue correlative studies and in vitro functional studies may provide insights into AD therapeutic strategies."
4,Mechanisims of asthma and allergic disease – 1070. Genetic mechanisms of immune imbalance in allergic inflamation,"At the present time is considered an established fact that at every stage of the immunological response to free radicals and their derivatives, antioxidant enzymes perform a regulatory function and may help limit or activation of immune responses. In this regard, of interest to identify the functionally significant variant genotype polymorphism Ile-105/Val-105 GSTπ1, which can contribute to and interfere with the functioning of the immune system in allergic diseases.","A total of 91 patients with various forms of allergic diseases and healthy individuals of Uzbek nationality. Verification of the diagnosis of allergic diseases in various organs and tissues was carried out according to the WHO International Classification (ICD-10). Analysis of the polymorphic variants of the gene GSTπ1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction of DNA synthesis (PCR) thermocycler and RFLP analysis followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Determination of lymphocyte immunophenotype CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+, CD23+, CD95+performed with monoclonal antibodies and the level of Ig classes A, M, G by radial immunodiffusion.","In our studies revealed that in the group with genotype Ile/Ile patients registered declines in CD3+, CD8+ and CD16+ up to 33,6 ± 0,45%, 15,6 ± 0,88% and 15,6 ± 0,88%, respectively compared with a group of people who did not have this genotype. Registered a significant increase in IgG level in patients with allergic inflammation, with the genotype homozygous and heterozygous genotype Ile-105/Ile-105 Ile-105/Val-105 compared with the homozygous genotype Val-105/Val-105 (p<0,01 in both cases). Expressed lower levels of IgA was associated with the presence of genotype I/I patients (p<0,05). Significant differences are manifested decreased content of CD95+, depending on the gene polymorphism Ile-105/Val-105 GSTπ1 studied patients reported in patients with genotype Ile-105/Ile-105 compared with the group with the genotype Ile-105/Val-105 (p<0,05).","Thus, the identified association Ile-105/Val-105 GSTπ1 gene polymorphism with indices of immune status in allergic diseases indicates that the genotype Ile-105/Ile-105 GSTπ1 gene plays an important role in the formation of immunological disorders in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases."
5,Polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility of type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction, hyperglycemia and progressive insulin deficiency, affecting mainly children and adolescents genetically predisposed. About 10% (2.4-16.4%) of T1D individuals develop celiac disease (CD), an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure. Both diseases have a common autoimmune origin and share a similar genetic Background, the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen (HLA-DQ). Some genetic association studies have also identified susceptibility polymorphisms non-HLA associated to both diseases, located in different genes: RGS1 (rs2816316), IL2-IL21 (rs6822844), BACH2 (rs11755527) and IL18RAP (rs917997).","The aim of the present study was to determine the allelic and genotypic frequencies of polymorphisms in RGS1, IL2-IL21, BACH2 and IL18RAP genes in a sample of 317 T1D individuals and to compare the frequency of the risk alleles in patients with negative (N=264) or positive (N=53) serology for CD.",Saliva or blood sample was collected and DNA extraction and genotyping performed by PCR Real-Time. All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The comparison between the allele and genotype frequencies was calculate by Chi-square and Fisher's exact test.,"The frequency of the allele risk for the genes RGS1 (allele A); IL2-IL21 (allele C); BACH2 (allele C) e IL18RAP (allele T) in T1D individuals and negative serology for CD was respectively: 95.5%, 97.4%, 79.8% and 46.6%. In T1D with seropositive, the frequency of the same alleles were: 98.1%(p=0.703), 100.0% (p=0.604), 86.0% (p=0.433) and 46.2%(p=1.000). Both genotype and allele frequencies were not significantly between T1D with negative or positive serology for CD."
6,Association of CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism on the metabolism of Donepezil with Alzheimer's disease in Indian population,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common adult form of dementia.1 It is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extra cellular amyloid plaques in selected brain regions. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor currently being used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is metabolized via CYP2D6 enzymes. The present study was undertaken to investigate CYP2D6*4 polymorphism on the serum concentration of Donepezil with responders and non-responders to Alzheimer's patients.,40 Alzheimer's patients with responders to Donezepil drug and 40 Alzheimer's patients with non-responders to donezepil drug were investigated for CYP2D6*4 polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Allele frequencies were derived from genotypic data. Drug responders - non-responders' comparisions were made using Chi-Square tests. Deviations from the Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium were also tested. Drug levels of Donezepil were determined using HPLC method.,"The CYP2D6*4 Polymorphism was seen to be in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium and showed significant allelic association and genotypic association between responders and non-responders of donezepil. Genotypic: P = 0.05; OR = 0.39 (0.13-1.15), Allelic: P = 0.008; OR = 2.79(1.20-6.58).",Our finding suggest that the CYP2D6 *4 genetic polymorphism may be associated with the individual differences in donezepil metabolism. An individualized dosage regimen design incorporating such genetic information would help to increase the clinical efficacy of donezepil in Alzheimer's patients.
7,Neurodegenerative diseases: complexity of clinical phenotypes in genetic models of alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a wide and complex group of disorders, age – associated, chronic and progressive whith unknown, and probably different, aetiologies. The complexity of the phenotype is probably due to the expression of a selective vulnerability of the different neuronal population and to the different pathogenetic mechanisms. This aetiopathogenetic complexity has been approached through the study of simple models constituted by the large Calabrian families in which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) segregates associated to the Presenilin 1 (PS1) Met 146Leu mutation [1] and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is caused by the Progranulin (GRN) c1145insA mutation [2].To investigate the phenotypic variability at onset in patients belonging to the two families for which all data (demographic, clinical and genetic) were available.","The clinical presentations were studied in 50 out of 148 familial AD (FAD) patients (age at onset = 4 0.0±4.8; 38% women, 18 alive) and in 9 out of 34 patients (age at onset 65.1±17.1) belonging to the FTD family.","Phenotypic variability at onset in AD is broad: four different clinical presentations may be recognized: 1) Amnestic (38%); 2) Disoriented (20%); 3) Dysexecutive (14%); 4) Apathetic (28 %). In the FTD, 89% of patients presented at onset with a memory deficit and 33% were spatially disoriented.","The study conducted on AD and FTD genetic models provides evidence that different genotypes present with a clinical overlapping at onset: symptoms classically associated with FTD are also present in AD and, conversely, FTD patients who are carriers of a PGRN mutation always show a memory deficit. Knowledge advancement calls for a steady upgrade and revision of the clinical criteria routinely used in the diagnostic processing."
8,Clinical and genetic analyses in a patient with PAPA syndrome complicated with inflammatory bowel disease,"PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease linked to mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. These mutations produce a hyper-phosphorylated PSTPIP1 protein and alter its participation in the activation of the “inflammasome”.","To elucidate the pathogenesis of PAPA syndrome, we examined the clinical status and complications and also analyzed the PSTPIP1 gene.","We herein report a 23-year-old Japanese male who suffered from recurrent arthritis in his knee and ankle joints, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne. Recently, he had experienced melena and multiple colonic ulcers had been detected by colonfiberscopy. His ulcerations resembled ulcers associated with Crohn's disease. A histological examination was then performed for the synovium of this knee joints, skin lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum, and the colon. The genomic DNA of PSTPIP1 were analysed in both the patient and his family.","1) A histological analysis revealed that a large number of neutrophils had accumulated in the skin lesions; however, very few neutrophils were detected in the pathological lesions of the knee joints and colon. 2) According to a gene analysis, we detected a novel heterozygous mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene; however, his healthy father also had the same mutation, thus suggesting that this mutation of PSTPIP1 might not be related to his phenotype. We are searching for other affected genes besides the PSTPIP1 gene for PAPA syndrome in this case."
9,"Genetic variants involved in specialized DNA replication and their relation with breast cancer risk, disease progression and patient prognosis","The molecular mechanisms involved in genetic instability, which is a driving force of cancer cells from earlier stages of pathologenesis, are not fully understood. Current evidence shows that overexpression of Pol θ, a “DNA repair” polymerase specialized in the replication of damaged DNA, which is altered in breast tumors, is not a passive agent in tumor development and is able to predict patient outcome. Aberrant POLQ expression may be related to genetic instability, and also resistance to “replicative stress”, leading to changes in replicating parameters and consequent tumor development. The objective of this project is to analyze genetic variants related to POLQ as new population biomarkers of risk, progression and prognosis in hereditary (HBC) and sporadic (SBC) breast cancer in Brazil.","Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were systematically identified through the NCBI database. SNPs identified result in amino acid exchange in the protein and are located within exons or promoter regions. Most SNPs have not been tested in population-based studies. We recruited 211 breast cancer patients (94 SBC and 114 HBC) and 206 women without cancer. In this case-control study, we first genotyped seven SNPs (rs61757736, rs55748151, rs41545723, rs1381057, rs587553, rs13065220, rs3806614) using Taqman Real Time PCR. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0.","Interestingly, the rs581553SNP located in a promoter region was associated with HBC (g.121265913T>C; HBC TT=16, Control TT=8; OR=2.01, CI95%= 1.32-3.32; p<0.001). Although the Chi-Square analysis did not show any statistical difference between groups for the other SNPs, the HBC group showed more polymorphic genotypes than SBC and Control groups regarding the rs1381057 SNP (c.7538T>C; SBC TT=7, HBC TT=13, Control TT=8).",These results suggest that POLQ germline variation may be related to cancer progression in this patient group. Additional SNPs are being analyzed and the correlation between genotype and relevant clinical variables for breast cancer prognosis will be evaluated.
