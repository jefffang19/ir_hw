0,microRNAs and genetic diseases,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), 19-25 nucleotides (nt) in length, generated from hairpin-shaped transcripts. They control the expression levels of their target genes through an imperfect pairing with target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), mostly in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) [1]. The biogenesis of miRNAs involves a complex protein system that includes members of the Argonaute family, Pol II-dependent transcription and the two RNase III proteins, Drosha and Dicer [2]. miRNAs are first transcribed in the nucleus as long transcripts, known as primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which can sometimes contain multiple miRNAs [3, 4]. Few pri-miRNA transcripts have been studied in detail, but increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs are regulated and transcribed like protein encoding genes [5].In brief, within the nucleus, Drosha first forms a micro-processor complex with the double-stranded RNA-binding protein DGCR8 [6]. It then processes the pri-miRNAs into a smaller, stem-loop miRNA precursor of ~70 nucleotides (pre-miRNA) [7]. pre-miRNAs are exported, in turn, across the nuclear membrane and into the cytoplasm by the Exportin-5 complex [8–10]. These pre-miRNAs are further cleaved by Dicer thus producing a 19- to 25-nucleotide RNA duplex. These duplexes are then incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) called RISC-like complex [11, 12], referred to as the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Only one strand of the miRNA-duplex, known as the mature miRNA, is incorporated into the miRISC complex, while the other strand, the miRNA-star (miRNA*), is degraded [1] although, recently, miRNAs* have been found to play a role similar to that of their cognate miRNAs. Within the miRISC complex, miRNAs bind to the mRNA targets and regulate gene expression, either at the translational level [13, 14] or at the transcript level [15–17] or both [18]. A crucial role in the recognition of the target mRNA by the miRNA is played by the so-called seed region, which is composed of six to seven nt, which shows a perfect complementarity between a miRNA and its target. miRNA can be localized in the intergenic (40%) or the intragenic (60%) regions [19]. Intragenic miRNAs are located within other transcriptional units which are termed host genes. The vast majority of intragenic miRNAs is localized within the intronic regions of their host genes and only a minority (10%) lies within exonic regions, usually pertaining to the non protein-coding host genes. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that many intronic miRNAs and their host genes are co-regulated and co-transcribed from a common promoter [20–22].","miRNAs are implicated in a wide range of basic biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation [23, 24]. Since the discovery of the strong impact of miRNAs on biological processes, it has been hypothesized that mutations affecting miRNA function may have a pathogenic role in human diseases. A large body of evidence has already shown that aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in most forms of human cancer [25–27], but fewer studies have established a clear link between miRNAs and human genetic disorders. Initially, there were two main (and contrasting) arguments against the hypothesis of miRNAs as genes responsible for human genetic diseases: (1) each miRNA is endowed with such a basic role in the regulation of gene expression and consequently in the regulation of basic cellular processes that a significant alteration of their function is not compatible with cell survival and ultimately with life; and (2) considering the great deal of redundancy in miRNA actions, a significant alteration of the function of a single miRNA may only give rise to subtle modifications in both the cellular transcriptome and proteome, which are unable to determine a significant perturbation of biological processes and ultimately lead to a diseased phenotype.Our aim in this review is to provide an overview of the evidence available to date which support the pathogenic role of miRNAs in human genetic diseases, with a particular focus on monogenic disorders. In order to achieve this goal, we will first describe the types of mutations affecting miRNA function that can result in human monogenic disorders, giving some recently described examples. In the second part of this review, we will give a broader picture of the hypothetic involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of human monogenic diseases based on the results obtained in vivo from the analysis of several animal models characterized by either the global perturbation of miRNA pathways or by the perturbation (either inactivation or overexpression) of single miRNAs.","Given the mechanisms of action of miRNAs (see above), three main types of mutation mechanisms affecting miRNA function can be envisaged (Figure 1): (1) mutations affecting primarily miRNAs, either point mutations in the mature sequence or larger mutations (that is, deletions or duplications of the entire miRNA locus); (2) mutations in the 3' UTR of mRNAs that can lead to the removal or to the de novo generation of a target recognition site for a specific miRNA; and (3) mutations in genes which participate in the general processes of miRNA processing and function and, therefore, are predicted to impact on global miRNA function.Figure 1Schematic diagram summarizing the main types of miRNA mutations with a potential aetiopathogenic role in monogenic disorders (see text for further details).Full size image","Large mutationsLikewise, protein-coding loci and also miRNA loci can be subjected to large mutations, such as deletions or duplications. To date, there are no examples of such mutations which are clearly associated with human mendelian diseases. However, a careful analysis of the genomic organization of miRNAs reveals that a number of intragenic miRNAs are localized within host genes (see above) whose mutations are responsible for human genetic disorders. By analysing the mutation spectrum previously described for the latter disease genes in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [28], we found evidence that some mutations do, indeed, significantly affect one or more miRNAs (Table 1). This is the case, for instance, in certain intragenic deletions responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, choroideraemia and Dent disease, among others, which are also predicted to encompass some miRNAs. It is of crucial importance to confirm these predictions and to determine whether or not the deletion of these miRNAs is able to play a role in the phenotype observed. Furthermore, several miRNAs loci are also either deleted or duplicated (Table 1) in some well-known human aneuploidy syndromes, and there is initial evidence of their contribution to the pathogenic mechanisms of the complex manifestations of these disorders [29].Table 1 Example of LARGE mutations, responsible for human genetic diseases, encompassing microRNA (miRNA) lociFull size tablePoint mutations in miRNA mature sequencesDuan and colleagues, in 2007, described a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the seed region of miR-125a. Through a series of in vitro analyses, the authors demonstrated that this SNP in miR-125a, in addition to reducing miRNA-mediated translational suppression, significantly altered the processing from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. Although this SNP has not been associated with a disease status, these data suggest, for the first time, that SNPs that reside within miRNA genes may, indeed, impair miRNA biogenesis and alter target selection and, therefore, have a potentially profound biological effect [30].The first example of point mutations in the mature sequence of a miRNA with an aetiopathogenic role in a human mendelian disease has been recently reported by Mencìa et al. [31]. They identified two different nucleotide substitutions in the seed region of the human miR-96 in two Spanish families affected by an autosomal dominant form of deafness, namely DFNA50. In particular, both the mutations, miR-96 (+13G>A) and (+14C>A), which were not present in several unrelated normal-hearing Spanish controls, were segregated in both of the families with a hearing impairment. miR-96, together with miR-182 and miR-183, is transcribed as a single polycistronic transcript and is reported to be expressed in the inner ear. For this reason, the authors also carried out a mutation screening of miR-182 and miR-183 in the same cohort of patients, tested for miR-96. However, they did not find any potential mutation, although this does not exclude the possibility that the latter two miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of other forms of deafness. The fact that both the above families manifested the hearing loss postlingually indicated that probably neither of the two miR-96 mutations resulted in impaired development of the inner ear. Instead, they could have had an impact on the regulatory role that miR-96 plays in the hair cells of the adult cochlea which maintain the gene expression profiles required for its normal function. In vitro experiments showed that both mutations impaired, but did not abrogate, the processing of miR-96 to its mature form, although an additional indirect effect on the expression of miR-182 and miR-183 due to the miR-96 mutations cannot be excluded. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that both mutations were able to affect the targeting of a subset of selected miR-96 target genes, mostly expressed in the inner ear. In contrast, no significant gain of function was associated with these two mutations, at least for the potentially new acquired miR-96 targets investigated. In addition, after an ophthalmologic revision, no ocular phenotype was observed in individuals carrying mutations in miR-96 (age range between 2 and 66 years), suggesting that its specific targets in the retina, a site in which miR-96 is also strongly expressed, were not critical for its function or that the translation of these targets was not markedly affected [31].The finding of a single base change (A>T) in the seed region of miR-96 in a mouse mutant (diminuendo) with a progressive hearing loss phenotype, provided additional support to the finding that a single base change in miR-96 is the causative mutation behind the hearing loss phenotype in both man and mouse [32]. In particular, the diminuendo mutant showed progressive hearing impairment in heterozygotes and profound deafness in homozygotes associated with hair cell defects. Lewis and colleagues suggested that the degeneration observed in homozygotes could be a consequence of a prior dysfunction of the hair cells. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the mutation has a direct effect on the expression of many genes, including transcription factor genes, that are directly required for hair cell development and survival. The large number of genes whose expression is affected by miR-96 suggests that the mechanism that explains the effects of the mutation may not be simple but, rather, may be the result of a combination of different small effects that act in concert to cause hair cell dysfunction [32].Mutations in miRNA target sitesIn animal cells, most miRNAs form imperfect hybrids with sequences in the 3'-UTR, with the miRNA 5'-proximal 'seed' region (positions 2-8) providing most of the pairing specificity [33, 34]. However, evidence is also accumulating that miRNAs may target mRNA-coding regions [35]. Generally, miRNAs inhibit protein synthesis either by repressing translation or by bringing about deadenylation and degradation of mRNA targets [36]. Since more than 700 miRNAs have been identified in the human and mouse genomes [37], and also considering that each miRNA can regulate, on average, the expression of 100-200 target genes [38, 39], the whole miRNA apparatus seems to participate in the control of the gene expression for a significant proportion of the mammalian gene complement.It is conceivable that some sequence variations falling within the 3'-UTR of mRNA may alter miRNA recognition sites, either by altering functional miRNA target sites or by creating aberrant miRNA target sites. Both types of sequence variations may potentially have deleterious effects in the case of either miRNA-mRNA pairs endowed with a biologically relevant (and non-redundant) role or when the formation of an illegitimate miRNA target occurs in mRNAs that are under selective pressure to avoid target sites for that particular miRNA (that is, in the case of the so-called anti-targets) [40].One of the first animal disorders with a mendelian transmission reported to be caused by dysregulation of a specific miRNA-mRNA target pair was the Texel sheep model. The Texel sheep phenotype is characterized by an inherited muscular hypertrophy that is more pronounced in the hindquarters of sheep [41]. Clop et al. [41] demonstrated that the myostatin (GDF8) gene of Texel sheep is characterized by a G to A transition in the 3' UTR that creates a target site for mir-1 and mir-206, which are highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. This sequence change leads to a translational inhibition of the myostatin gene and, hence, is responsible for the muscular hypertrophy of Texel sheep [41].There are now some examples of sequence variations in the 3'-UTR of mRNAs altering miRNA recognition sites which have been suggested to have a pathogenic role in human genetic diseases. The first was reported by Abelson et al. [42], who identified two independent occurrences of the identical sequence variant in the binding site for the miRNA hsa-miR-189 (now termed miR-24*) in the 3'-UTR of the SLITRK1 mRNA in familial cases of Tourette's syndrome, a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic vocal and motor tics. This 3'-UTR sequence variation in SLITRK1 was proposed in order to determine an increased extent of repression of this gene by hsa-miR-189 (miR-24*). It must be underlined, however, that the involvement of SLITRK1 in Tourette's syndrome has been subsequently questioned by other reports [43–47]. The second example is represented by two different point mutations in the 3'-UTR of the REEP1 gene which have been associated with an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG31) [48, 49]. These mutations, which alter the sequence of a predicted target site for miR-140, were found to segregate with the disease phenotype and were not detected in a large set of human controls. These data strongly suggest the pathogenic role of the impaired miR-140-REEP1 binding in some SPG31 families, although so far no functional data have been provided to consolidate this hypothesis.Georges and colleagues tried to address, in a more systematic way, the potential implications of sequence variations in the 3'-UTR of mRNAs in the pathogenesis of human diseases. They demonstrated, through SNP analysis, that sequence variations creating or destroying putative miRNA target sites are abundant in the human genome and suggested that they might be important effectors of phenotypic variation [50]. A list of additional sequence variations altering putative miRNA recognition sites, and with a potential role in human disease, can be found in a review by Sethupathy and Collins [51]. The authors critically reviewed a number of studies that claimed that there is an association between the presence of polymorphisms/mutations in miRNA target sites (poly-miRTSs) and human diseases, giving a special emphasis on possible biases and confounding factors. They concluded that only a few presented rigorous genetic and functional evidence. The authors therefore suggested a set of concrete recommendations in order to guide future investigations of putative disease-associated poly-miRTSs [51].Mutations impacting on global miRNA functionAs previously described, a number of different proteins are involved in the processing of miRNAs. Mutations altering the function of these proteins are predicted to determine a global alteration of miRNA function. This aspect is exploited, for instance, in the experimental inactivation of Dicer that is used to assess the biological consequences of the global perturbation of miRNA activity in whole organisms or specific tissues/cell types (see also below). Complete loss-of-function mutations of certain key members of the miRNA processing pathway (such as Drosha and Dicer) are expected to be incompatible with life and, therefore, are not believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of human monogenic disorders. However, there are two human diseases characterized by mutations in genes involved in miRNA processing/activity, namely DiGeorge syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. The DGCR8 gene, which maps to chromosomal region 22q11.2, is commonly deleted in DiGeorge syndrome [52], characterized by cardiovascular defects, craniofacial defects, immunodeficiency and neurobehavioral alterations. As previously mentioned, DGCR8 is a component of the Drosha complex and its haploinsufficiency in DiGeorge syndrome patients may have a potential impact on miRNA processing. However, also based on the results of the targeted inactivation of the corresponding gene in mouse [53], there are no data, thus far, which point to a functional effect of DGCR8 haploinsufficiency on miRNA biogenesis.The second example is represented by the Fragile X syndrome. The product of the FRM1 gene, whose loss-of-function is responsible for this condition, is a selective RNA binding protein. It has been proposed that the FMRP1 protein may function as a translational repressor of its mRNA targets at synapses by recruiting the RISC complex along with miRNAs and by facilitating the recognition between miRNAs and a specific subset of their mRNA targets. This interaction is suggested to be important in the process of synaptic plasticity which, instead, is largely compromised in Fragile X syndrome patients [54, 55]. However, this hypothesis requires further investigations. In conclusion, there is no evidence so far to support a direct role of altered global miRNA processing in human hereditary disorders."
1,Genetic susceptibility to infectious disease in East African Shorthorn Zebu: a genome-wide analysis of the effect of heterozygosity and exotic introgression,"Positive multi-locus heterozygosity-fitness correlations have been observed in a number of natural populations [1, 2]. Genome-wide heterozygosity is correlated with inbreeding within a population [3] and heterozygosity-fitness correlations have therefore been associated with inbreeding depression [4]. Inbreeding may be detrimental to fitness if: (i) fitness related traits are over-dominant, such that the heterozygous genotype results in greater fitness than either homozygote, or (ii) there are recessive alleles present in the population that result in lower fitness [5]. The extent to which the heterozygosity of genetic markers reflects genome-wide heterozygosity and inbreeding is a contentious issue, and heterozygosity-fitness correlations may result from a few loci of major effect in linkage disequilibrium with the genetic markers rather than the effect of inbreeding across the genome [2, 3, 6, 7]. However, when large numbers of markers are used, estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity are greatly improved, are more likely to correlate with inbreeding, and are less likely to correlate with the fitness effects of a few loci [2, 3].Inbreeding has been observed to have a negative effect on fitness-related traits in many populations [8], e.g. [9, 10], including some European cattle populations [11, 12]. In a number of natural populations susceptibility to infectious disease has been found to be associated with heterozygosity e.g. [13–15] and inbreeding e.g. [16]. Infectious disease susceptibility in humans has been found to have a strong genetic component in numerous studies reviewed in [17], with many genes and genetic pathways associated with susceptibility to different diseases. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is considered to play a significant role in determining susceptibility to various pathogens [18], and MHC-targeted breeding programmes have been suggested for captive populations [19, 20]. In one natural population it was found that the effect of a single locus linked to the MHC exceeded the effect of genome-wide heterozygosity on fitness [21].Exotic introgression in a locally adapted population may also reduce fitness. A number of studies have observed a negative effect of introgression on fitness (outbreeding depression) [22, 23]. These may result from either (i) the break-up of co-adapted epistatic interaction between genes, or (ii) the introduction of non-locally adapted alleles [24].In this study, we tested for associations of heterozygosity and exotic European taurine breed introgression with death and illness due to infectious disease during the first year of life, in a population of East African shorthorn zebu (EASZ) cattle (crossbred Bos taurus x Bos indicus) from western Kenya. More than 500 calves were followed for the first year of their life as part of the Infectious Disease in East African Livestock (IDEAL) project [25]. The calves were closely monitored throughout; deaths and episodes of clinical illness were reported and followed up by trained veterinary staff. During the study, more than 15% of the calves died, with the majority of deaths due to infectious diseases, most commonly East Coast Fever, helminth infections, heartwater and trypanosomiasis [26]. Given the heavy infectious disease burden on these cattle coupled with minimal disease control or treatment, an ability to survive infection is likely to be significantly associated with fitness. Furthermore, more than half the surviving calves were reported to have at least one episode of clinical illness during the study period, and almost all these episodes were attributed to infectious disease (see Methods). We propose that clinical illness is also indicative of a vulnerability to infectious disease that could affect fitness in this environment.All calves in the IDEAL population were genotyped using the 50K Illumina® BovineSNP50 beadchip v. 1 (55,777 SNPs before quality control). These SNPs are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, with an average of 1,895 on each autosome (ranging from 1,009 to 3,553) and 1,362 on the X chromosome (102 remain unassigned).The study population was found to be partly introgressed by one or possibly more European taurine breeds [27, 28] (determined from analysis of genome-wide SNP data using STRUCTURE [29]). This reflects the effects of a substantial breed improvement programme, involving the crossing of local cattle with European breeds, that took place in the mid-1990s with intermittent cross-breeding thereafter. As a result, approximately 20% of the calves show levels of introgression consistent with crossing with European breeds ≤ 5 generations ago (fraction European taurine > 2-6) [27].We would also expect some inbreeding to occur in this population, since mating is largely unmanaged, there is a relatively low number of breeding bulls, and cattle are generally only transported over short distances (only a small fraction of cattle are traded and these over distances typically just 20-30 km). Also, historically, this region has experienced major rinderpest epidemics, which have reduced the effective population size of the EASZ [28]. In this study we calculate the genome-wide heterozygosity for the calves in the IDEAL population using the same SNP data set as was used to calculate exotic introgression [28].In this study we aim to determine whether inbreeding (as estimated by SNP heterozygosity) and outbreeding (as estimated by the estimated proportion of genetic markers that descend from a European taurine breed) affect the likelihood of death or illness due to infectious disease and therefore whether there is evidence of a genetic basis to vulnerability to infectious disease in EASZ. We use results from earlier studies that have determined the degree of European taurine introgression [28] and describe and analyse the causes of instances of death and illness for all the calves in the IDEAL project [25, 26]. Through analysis of these data we find associations of both heterozygosity and European taurine introgression with vulnerability to infectious disease during the first year of life in this population of EASZ.","The sample size available for analysis was 518 calves (see Methods for inclusion/exclusion criteria), of which 68 (13%) died of infection-related disease within one year of birth (see Methods for more details). Of the survivors, episodes of clinical illness (almost always related to infections) were reported in 243 (54%) (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1).Table 1 
                        Numbers of calves that fall into the different categories used for the statistical analysis of the effects of heterozygosity and introgression on likelihood of death and clinical illness
Full size tableThe distributions of observed heterozygosity values for non-introgressed (defined as < 2-6 European taurine) and introgressed calves (> 2-6 European taurine) are shown in Figure 1. The mean heterozygosity of non-introgressed calves is 0.28 (with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.01). This is not an unusual level of heterozygosity for a cattle population. Holstein-Friesians (European taurine) have been found to have average heterozygosity of 0.33 (SD = 0.01), Jersey (European taurine) have an average heterozygosity of 0.25 (SD = 0.03), N’dama (African taurine) have an average heterozygosity of 0.17 (SD = 0.03) and Ethiopian Sheko (admixed African taurine and Asian zebu) have an average heterozygosity of 0.26 (SD = 0.0003) [27].Figure 1

Full size imageIn order to test whether or not our estimates of heterozygosity are likely to reflect true genome-wide heterozygosity, we randomly sampled our SNPs without replacement 100 times and determined the degree of correlation in the heterozygosity estimates for calves based on one half of the markers and the estimates based on the other half [2, 6]. We found a consistently strong correlation between the estimates (mean Pearson’s r = 0.98, SD = 0.0012, range = 0.977-0.982). Since some SNPs may be in linkage disequilibrium with one another, we repeated the analysis with two smaller subsets (each representing a different random sample, without replacement, of one 10th of the total SNPs). Even with this much smaller set of markers, a strong correlation between the estimates was found (mean Pearson’s r = 0.91, SD = 0.0053, range = 0.89-0.92).The non-introgressed calves show a skewed distribution of heterozygosity values, with the majority (93%) contained within a near-symmetrical distribution ± 0.010 from a mode of 0.284 (Figure 1). However, there is a long tail of 28 calves with lower values. We categorise calves with values < 0.274 as “low” heterozygosity, assumed to reflect a higher degree of inbreeding than the population norm. Introgressed calves show a different distribution of heterozygosity values that are generally higher than those for non-introgressed calves (Figure 1) (Mann Whitney U test, P < 0.001).The relationship between heterozygosity and introgression is shown in Figure 2. As expected, there is a clear increase in heterozygosity with increasing introgression. However, in addition to the 28 non-introgressed calves with low heterozygosity, there are several introgressed calves with heterozygosity values that appear low relative to the amount of introgression. In order to investigate the effect of variation in heterozygosity on the fitness of introgressed calves independently of the effect of introgression we define a group of calves with low heterozygosity relative to their degree of introgression. We define this group by finding the best fit linear regression and iteratively excluding calves with heterozygosity values > 0.01 below their expected value. This procedure results in the fitted regression line shown in Figure 2 (with the -0.01 threshold also indicated). Using this criterion, 9 of the 113 introgressed calves are categorised as low heterozygosity. Two of these 9 died and 6 others experienced at least one clinical episode (see Table 1).Figure 2Plot of heterozygosity against proportion European introgression for all calves in our analysis. Calves that died are highlighted (red symbols). The best fit relationship between heterozygosity (H) and introgression (I) for non-inbred calves is shown (thick line: regression equation H = 0.284 (95% confidence intervals ±0.0003) + I*0.312 (±0.006), R2 = 0.972). The cut-off to define ‘low’ heterozygosity calves varies with introgression, since the expected or mean heterozygosity varies with introgression. Calves that are more that 0.01 below the expected heterozygosity (blue dashed line) for their amount of introgression are defined as ‘low’ heterozygosity (see Results and Methods). The orange dashed line indicates the cut-off for introgressed calves (2-6%).Full size imageWe compared both calves that died and those that survived but experienced any episode of clinical illness to a reference category of healthy calves (those that survived and had no reported episode of clinical illness). We considered two categorical predictors of these outcomes, low heterozygosity and being introgressed, using a multinomial logistic regression (described in Methods; results in Table 2). We used these categorical predictors, rather than analysing the estimates directly, due to the non-normality of the data (the distribution of values of both heterozygosity and introgression are highly skewed) and to allow us to robustly account for the relationship between heterozygosity and introgression (Figures 1 and 2, Additional file 1: Table S1).Table 2 
                        Summary of results of a multinomial logistic regression of the effects of genome-wide heterozygosity and introgression (as two level factors) on the likelihood of death and the likelihood of clinical illness
Full size tableWe first consider the association between predictors and calf death due to infectious disease. For non-introgressed calves (fraction European taurine < 2-6) only there is strong evidence of a relationship between death and low heterozygosity: odds ratio (OR) = 10.8 (95% CIs 3.0-48.1); P < 0.001 (Table 3). For all calves, this relationship remains when both low heterozygosity and introgression are included as predictors: OR = 9.5 (3.5-27.9); P < 0.001 (Table 2). There is no evidence of an interaction between low heterozygosity and introgression (P > 0.05) and there is no evidence of an association between death and degree of introgression (OR = 1.4 [0.7-2.9]; P = 0.39) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the nature of infectious disease-related deaths among the low heterozygosity calves. These results are robust to variation in the cut-off for introgressed calves (see Methods).Table 3 
                        Summary of results of Fisher’s exact tests of the effects of low genome-wide heterozygosity (as a two-level factor) on the likelihood of death and the likelihood of clinical illness for the sub-populations of non-introgressed and introgressed calves
Full size tableClinical illness is a less well defined phenotype than death, since it includes a wide range of disease signs and it cannot be unequivocally determined whether or not an instance of clinical illness was the result of infectious disease or not (although it is likely that the overwhelming majority were). Despite this, clinical illness and death are clearly related outcomes. Moreover, because many more calves experienced clinical illness during their first year than died, this outcome may provide increased power to detect small effects. For non-introgressed calves there is evidence of a relationship between illness and low heterozygosity: OR = 3.5 (95% CIs 1.05-15.1); P = 0.026 (Table 3). For all calves, this relationship remains when both low heterozygosity and introgression are included as predictors: OR = 3.4 [1.3-9.3]; P = 0.018 (Table 2). However, for this phenotype there is also strong evidence of an association with introgression, with introgressed calves being more likely to experience illness (OR = 2.4 [1.5-3.8]; P < 0.001). Again there is no evidence of any interaction between low heterozygosity and introgression (P > 0.05). These results are robust to variation in the cut-off for introgressed calves (see Methods).","Our results indicate that there is a genetic basis to vulnerability to infectious disease in East African Shorthorn Zebu. We find a positive association between low heterozygosity and both death and illness. Since we use a reasonable proxy for genome-wide heterozygosity (40,457 SNPs across all autosomes), and the estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity are highly correlated for different subsets of SNPs, we consider it likely that our results are indicative of the presence of inbreeding depression in the study population, rather than being a consequence of localised associations between fitness and loci of large effect [6, 7, 17].Our results indicate the presence of fitness-related genotypes that are either over-dominant or have recessive deleterious alleles in the population. Although the proportion of calves that we classified as “low” heterozygosity was small (approximately 7%), the effect on infectious disease-related mortality was large (OR ~ 9) and there was also an effect on clinical illness (OR ~ 3). Our results give population attributable fractions (for the non-introgressed population) due to low heterozygosity of 14% of mortality and 4% of clinical illness [30]. In principle, therefore, cases of illness and deaths could be reduced by better management practices (e.g. bull rotation).We found evidence that European taurine introgression affected health as it was a significant predictor of clinical illness (Table 2). As there were only 13 deaths among those with fractional introgression greater than 2-6 we had very little power to detect any effect on death alone. Nonetheless, our results for these two phenotypes are not inconsistent, as the confidence intervals for the odds ratios overlap (see Table 2). We suggest that clinical illness is a marker for vulnerability in this population and consequently that European taurine introgressed calves are more vulnerable in this sense.We could find no non-genetic confounding factors that could be driving the observed associations between introgression and either death or illness. The introgressed calves (even those with high introgression) could not be distinguished from non-introgressed calves by the field team [25]; exotic introgression was only discovered upon genetic analysis of the calves. And, although the introgressed calves were not found uniformly distributed among the 20 sub-locations of the study [28], there is no evidence of geographic variation in the rate of mortality or of clinical illness.Since the EASZ ancestors of the study population have been present in East Africa for many generations [28], it might be expected that they may have in some way adapted to the specific challenges posed by that environment, in particular to the infectious diseases present in that region. Infectious disease was the primary cause of first year mortality and illness in this population, and thus the ability to withstand infection is likely to be of significant selective advantage. On the other hand, the introgressed animals descend, in part, from European cattle, which have not had the same history of selective pressures. It has been found that European breeds are more susceptible than local breeds to some infectious diseases that are prevalent in Africa, such as East Coast Fever [31, 32], bovine tuberculosis [33, 34], and trypanosomiasis [35, 36]. Thus, the European breeds are, in this important respect, less well adapted to the East African environment, and introgressed animals, while more heterozygous due to outbreeding, are also less locally adapted. While increased heterozygosity is likely to be beneficial if fitness related traits are over-dominant or there are recessive deleterious alleles in the population, the breaking up of or loss of locally adapted genotypes is likely to be detrimental to fitness. Both these competing forces appear to be at work in this population of East African Shorthorn Zebu calves in western Kenya.","In conclusion, in this indigenous cattle population from the tropics we find strong associations between genome-wide heterozygosity and both death and clinical illness due to infectious diseases. There is evidence that introgression of European taurine breeds also increases vulnerability to infectious diseases. We therefore believe that we have observed the effect of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, and have found evidence of a genetic component to vulnerability to infectious disease and of adaptation in the East African Shorthorned Zebu population in western Kenya. This implies that the significant burden of infectious disease in this population could, in principle, be reduced by better breeding practices."
2,"Ascending aortic aneurysm in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve, positive history of systemic autoimmune diseases and common genetic factors: a case report","The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) affects 1 to 2% of the population and may be complicated by abnormalities of the aortic wall, including dilatation, aneurysm and dissection [1].Specific systemic autoimmune diseases are associated with cardiovascular manifestations, including aortic aneurysm [2, 3].We reported a case of a 64-year-old male with BAV and a history of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and who developed ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. In addition we have performed a genetic screnning of 5 gene polymorphisms (ACE I/D, MTHFR 677C>T, MMP9-1562C>T, PAI 1 4G/5G; MMP12 A82G) reported in multiple case control studies to be genetic risk factors for the development of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [4].","The patient was a -64 year-old man, who had a 25-year history of hypertension and a 8-year history of hypothyroidism. In 2000, the patient underwent a corrective osteotomy of the spine for ankylosing spondylitis and spondylarthropathy. He had also been diagnosed as having a dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta associated to BAV. The patients was treated with metilprednisolone along with colchicine, and was followed regularly for progressive aortic dilation.He was admitted at our hospital for further evaluation on December 2008. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed aortic root and ascending aortic dilatation (Figures 1, 2).Figure 1

A computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of the ascending aorta aneurysm (53 mm) and ectasia of the aortic root and arch (respectively 45 mm and 42 mm). The patient was referred to our cardiothoracic surgery service in order to evaluate the need for aortic root replacement. Preoperative coronary angiography and aortography confirmed the presence of ascending aortic aneurysm root without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or regurgitation so the cardiac surgeons decided to postpone surgical treatment at the time when the valve requires replacement.Genetic testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in order to identify genotypes patient. The genetic results for the studied polymorphisms are shown in table 1. The patient was TT, DD, 5G5G and TT homozygous for the MMP9-1562C, ACE I/D, PAI 1 4G/5G and MTHFR C677T genetic polymorphisms, respectively.Table 1 Genotypes of the studied candidate genesFull size table
","Patients with AS and SLE may develop cardiovascular manifestations ranging from asymptomatic forms to life threatening conditions, including common cardiovascular manifestation and valvular problems [2, 3]. The mechanism responsible for the occurrence and progression of aortic dilatation has also not yet been elucidated in detail. Aortic aneurysm may be the result of the medial degeneration, induced by chronic inflammation and accelerated by prolonged corticosteroid therapy.Aneurism formation may be more common in patients with the coexistence of BAV. In fact, bicuspid aortic valve is considered to be a cause of intrinsic changes in the aortic wall resulting in aneurysms of the ascending aorta, independent of degree of valvular dysfunction [1].In addition to the presence of BAV and the inflammatory involvement of the aortic wall by immune diseases and systemic hypertension, genetic factors may contribute significantly to the development of aortic dilation in our patient. Indeed, our observations are in agreement with such hypothesis, reporting the presence of homozygosity for genetic variants of MMP9, ACE, MTHFR and PAI-1 genes that have been previously associated with a significant risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease [4]. Expression of MMP-9 is elevated in vascular disease, and in particular within aneurysm tissues. A meta-analysis of 2 larger case-control studies that have looked at the ACE I/D polymorphism in AAA patients showed a strong overall association between ACE D allele (RR 1.33 [1.20e1.48]) and disease [4].An association between the presence of AAA and elevated MTHFR 677C>T has been indicated, and meta-analysis of these studies reveal a significant increased risk of AAA disease for the T allele variant [4]. Recently, a study suggested a significant association between growth and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1–675 4G/5G and AAA [5].In the present case report, in addition to inflammatory involvement of the aortic wall by systemic autoimmune diseases, these specific genetic variants may have promoted the development of aortic dilation in this patient.BAV is responsible for a large proportion of patients coming to aortic valve replacement. The mechanism responsible for the associated vascular complications remains controversial. Some patients with BAV have rapidly progressive valve and aortic dysfunction while some remain without complications.Several advances in the molecular genetics of aortic valve disease related to BAV, have recently been made, especially through the use of linkage analysis. These resulted in the discovery of mutations in NOTCH1 gene, a signaling and transcriptional regulator gene on chromosome 9, NOTCH1 and some different loci linked to BAV on chromosomes 18, 5, and 13 [6].However, genetic basis of BAV remains unclear. Our data suggest, for the first time, that some genetic biomarkers (functional polymorphisms) may predispose BAV patients at an increased risk of aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and dissection. Our findings are hypothesis generating and need to be confirmed by further clinical studies.Elucidating the genetic basis for BAV may have substantial implications in clinical practice. Identification of specific genetic markers may helpful for early clinical detection of relatives; genetic markers might be also used to predict the natural progression of the condition and to identify those cases that might have potentially life-threatening complications from BAVTherefore, future studies focusing on the identification of additional disease-causing and susceptibility genes are needed in order to improve understanding of the pathophysiological processes as well as to identify new therapeutic strategies.",Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

3,Genetic variation in the tau protein phosphatase-2A pathway is not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk,"One of the neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are composed of the microtubule-binding protein tau that is hyperphosphorylated [1]. Tau phosphorylation is catalysed by tau protein kinases and reversed by tau protein phosphatases [2]. It has been reported that the expression and activity of the major tau phosphatase in human brain, protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), is decreased in the affected areas of AD brain [3, 4], suggesting that a downregulation of tau phosphatases in AD brain might underlie the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. The overall PP2A activity is determined by composition of the holoenzyme from the catalytic subunit alpha (PP2CA) and the regulatory subunit B alpha (PP2R2A), the level of PP2A inhibitors such as ANP32A (inhibitor-1 of protein phosphatase-2A), and changes in PP2A methylation regulated by the leucine carboxyl methytransferase-1 (LCMT1) and the protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PPME1); in addition, the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase PIN1 induces conformational changes in tau that can facilitate tau dephosphorylation by PP2A (Figure 1). Consequently, PPP2CA, PPP2R2A, ANP32A, LCMT1, PPME1 and PIN1 are good candidate genes for the analysis of AD susceptibility. The largest genome wide association (GWA) study in AD [5] did not find significant results for all these PP2A-related genes. However, it cannot be discarded that these genes in the tau PP2A pathway are among the genes with significant nominal association but without reaching significance (p < 10-5 or less) after adjustment for multiple testing in GWAs; in addition, it is also possible that some of the SNPs analyzed in our study were not present in the arrays used in GWAs. Therefore, we conducted a case-control association study involving genes in the tau PP2A pathway in relation to AD risk, in a Spanish cohort.Figure 1Genes related with the tau protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) pathway. PP2A dephosphorylates tau and is composed of an structural subunit A, a catalytic subunit alpha (PPP2CA) and a regulatory subunit B alpha (PPP2R2A). The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase PIN1 binds to tau and facilitates PP2A activity, whereas ANP32A inhibits PP2A activity. Methylation by the leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT1) increases PP2A activity, and demethylation by protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PPME1) reduces PP2A activity.Full size image","The study included 729 AD patients (67% women; mean age at study 77.2 years; SD 8.0; range 61-103 years; mean age at onset 73.3 years; SD 7.8; range 60-100 years) who met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [6]. All AD cases were defined as sporadic because their family history did not mention any first-degree relative with dementia. AD patients were recruited from the Departments of Neurology of University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"" (Santander, Spain) and Hospital ""La Paz"" (Madrid, Spain), and from Alzheimer Center Reina Sofia Foundation (Madrid, Spain). The large majority of patients were living in the community and had been referred by their general practitioner; few had been admitted from hospital wards or nursing home facilities. Control subjects were 670 unrelated individuals (64% women; mean age 78.3 years; SD 9.4; range 60-104 years) randomly selected from nursing homes. These subjects had complete neurologic and medical examinations that showed that they were free of significant illness and had Mini Mental State Examination scores of 28 or more, which were verified by at least one subsequent annual following-up assessment. The controls arose from the same base population as the cases. The AD and control samples were Caucasians originating from a limited geographical area in northern Spain (Santander) and from the central area of Spain (Madrid).Blood samples were taken after written informed consent had been obtained from the subjects or their representatives. The study was approved by the ethical committees of the University Hospital ""Marqués de Valdecilla"", Alzheimer Center Reina Sofia Foundation, and the Hospital ""La Paz"". Genotyping of PPP2CA (rs7705319 and rs4958177), PPP2R2A (rs2046225, rs7823021, rs17055172, rs12676426 and rs2046223), ANP32A (rs2924633, rs1551345, rs1551344, rs1551342, rs11632936, rs2958405 and rs1551343), LCMT1 (rs8062337, rs277898, rs277886 and rs277892), PPME1 (rs10898966, rs2848557, rs500608 and rs544356), and PIN1 (rs2233678, rs1077220, rs2010457 and rs2287838) polymorphisms was performed using the iPLEX Gold assay on the MassArray system (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, USA). We used data from the HapMap project http://www.hapmap.org to select htSNPs capturing 100% of PPP2CA genetic variability, 75% of PPP2R2A, 95% of ANP32A, 95% of LCMT1, 75% of PPME1, and 80% of PIN1 genetic variability in Caucasians. SNPs were chosen among those with minor allele frequencies ≥ 5% using Haploview v3.2 software http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview with an r2 threshold of 0.8. PPP2R2A rs12676426 and PPME1 rs500608 that were significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were excluded from the analysis. In addition, we removed PIN1 rs1077220 with a non-homogeneous genotypic distribution between our two control populations (Santander and Madrid) and which were also different from the HapMap CEU distribution.HWE was calculated for the htSNPs in the control population using Pearson's χ2 statistics. We assessed pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the htSNPs by D' and r2 statistics. Haplotype reconstruction and their frequencies in cases and controls were estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm, method implemented in Haploview 3.32. Pearson's χ2 statistics were performed to compare genotype, allele, and haplotype distribution of the patients and control for each htSNP. Genotypic and allelic distributions were assessed by logistic regression using SPSS software.","As shown in Table 1, the distribution of the minor allele frequencies of the PP2A-related genes did not differ significantly between AD and control groups. Haplotype distributions were not significantly different between cases and controls in the overall analysis or after stratification by APOE ε4 allele (data not shown). There were no major differences in allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies in our total sample associated to either age or gender subgroups. The data set was analyzed for epistatic interactions between the 6 PP2A-related genes and no significant effects were observed.Table 1 Minor allele frequencies distribution of tau phosphatases genes in AD patients and controlsFull size table","Genes harbouring markers with only modest evidence of association (nominally significant but not reaching the genome-wide significance threshold) can be identified if they belong to the same biological pathway or mechanism; therefore, pathway-based approaches, which jointly consider multiple variants in interacting or related genes, might complement the most-significant SNPs/genes approach for interpreting genome-wide association (GWA) data on complex diseases [7, 8]. In fact, genetic variation in the immune system and in lipid metabolism pathways is a cause of AD susceptibility [9, 10]. Although genetic markers of the genes examined in this study (PPP2CA, PPP2R2A, ANP32A, LCMT1, PPME1 and PIN1) were not found associated to AD in the largest GWA study [5], our main hypothesis was that common variation in genes directly related to tau dephosphorylation in the PP2A pathway might underlie individual differences in susceptibility to AD. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its type to be conducted in this pathway. There is a selective and significant neuron-specific reduction in PP2A catalytic subunit and PP2A regulatory B subunit mRNAs in AD hippocampus [3, 4], and this reduced neuronal PP2A immunoreactivity closely correlates with NFT load [4], suggesting that PP2A dysfunction contributes to AD tau pathology. In addition, cDNA microarray techniques have revealed downregulated expression of PPP2CA gene in AD brain [11, 12]. Conversely, in AD brain has been observed a significant increase in the neocortical levels of PP2A inhibitors [13], which co-localize with abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. These data suggest the possible involvement of ANP32A (inhibitor-1 of PP2A) in AD neurofibrillary pathology through the inhibition of PP2A activity. LCMT1 promotes PP2A activity by methylating its catalytic subunit, and PPME1 catalyses the removal of the methyl group, thus reversing the activity of LCMT1. Methylated PP2A catalytic subunit levels are reduced in AD frontal/temporal cortex [14], and LCMT1 levels are also selectively decreased in AD-affected regions and in tangle-bearing neurons [15]. An interaction between tau and PIN1 is thought to facilitate the dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated tau by PP2A, promoting microtubule stability [16]. In AD brain, PIN1 expression in the hippocampus and parietal cortex is low [17] and inversely correlated with neurofibrillary degeneration [18].In an Italian study [19], carriers of PIN1 (-842, rs2233678) C allele had an increased risk of AD, lower age of onset, and reduced PIN1 levels in peripheral mononuclear cells, but subsequent studies [20–23] did not replicate these findings. We failed to detect the association of PIN1 (-842, rs2233678) with AD. We also failed to observe any allele, genotype or haplotype association of PPP2CA, PPP2R2A, ANP32A, LCMT1 and PPME1 genes with AD. Because we studied htSNPs capturing 80% of PIN1 and 75% of PPP2R2A and PPME1 genetic variability, it might be argued that we have missed a hypothetical disease locus, which would have been detected by analysis of extended haplotypes; however, the complete linkage disequilibrium across the PIN1, PPP2R2A and PPME1 regions in our study argues against this possibility. Our negative results with all these PP2A pathway-related genes are probably not due to insufficient statistical power, because our sample size had enough power (94%) to detect and odds ratio of 1.5 at disease allele frequencies of 0.10."
