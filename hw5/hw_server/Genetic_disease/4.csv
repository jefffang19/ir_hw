0,Prostate cancer genomics: can we distinguish between indolent and fatal disease using genetic markers?,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health burden, being the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among men in developed countries. In 2007, almost 800,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 250,000 deaths from this disease were estimated to have occurred worldwide [1]. The highest incidence of prostate cancer is observed in the USA, with 192,280 new cases and 27,360 deaths expected in 2009, thereby being the second most common cause of cancer-related death [2]. Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease and its natural history is not completely understood. Early autopsy studies have shown a high prevalence of clinically undetected prostate cancer at time of death. In the USA, more than one in three men over 50 years of age had histologic evidence of prostate cancer at autopsy and this prevalence was observed to increase with age, with more than 67% of men aged over 80 years having prostate cancer at time of death [3]. These findings indicate that a high proportion of prostate tumors are clinically insignificant and will never lead to a lethal outcome. Furthermore, the introduction and widespread application of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has led to increased detection of early-stage, low-volume, non-palpable tumors. This has in turn raised concerns of increased overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of indolent disease [4, 5]. To this end, new strategies to help clinicians distinguish between lethal and indolent prostate cancer are urgently needed. Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable cancers in men and recent studies have revealed numerous genetic variants associated with this disease. This review will give an overview of the current knowledge of prostate cancer genetics, with a special focus on the ability of genetic variants to predict more aggressive forms.","A family history of prostate cancer is one of the strongest risk factors, and twin studies suggest that as much as 42% of the disease risk is explained by heritable factors [6]. Attempts to decipher the heritable component of prostate cancer based on candidate gene association studies and genome-wide linkage studies in multiple case families have suggested numerous prostate cancer susceptibility genes and loci. However, an inability to replicate reported linkage and association findings suggest that prostate cancer is genetically complex with multiple common low-penetrance genes involved in prostate cancer predisposition [7]. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful method to identify genomic low-risk susceptibility regions for complex diseases, including cancer [8]. Through genotyping platforms that explore hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously, it is possible to screen the complete genome for common genetic variation associated with the disease of interest. In 2006 the first prostate cancer susceptibility region was identified at chromosome 8q24. This region was initially identified through linkage analysis in Icelandic families with prostate cancer, followed up by association analysis in three independent case-control populations [9], and separately through admixture mapping in African Americans [10]. Subsequent GWAS and region-focused studies have revealed five distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks harboring prostate cancer susceptibility alleles at 8q24 [11–17]. The 8q24 region has also been shown to harbor susceptibility alleles for breast cancer [18], colorectal cancer [19], bladder cancer [20], and ovarian cancer [14]. The 1.2 Mb sequence at 8q24 containing all observed risk alleles does not code for any known genes, and the biologic mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown. The oncogene c-Myc is the closest distal gene to this region and it has been suggested that the observed associations reflect long-range control of Myc expression; however, further functional studies are needed to reveal the role that these variants play in cancer susceptibility. To date, 29 distinct genetic loci harboring prostate cancer risk alleles have been identified and consistently replicated (Table 1). In general, the effect of variants in these regions on prostate cancer risk is modest, with odds ratios typically ranging between 1.1 and 1.3. It has been estimated [21] that hitherto identified variants together explain approximately 22% of the familial risk of prostate cancer, and it is anticipated that many more prostate cancer susceptibility variants will be identified in the future.Table 1 Established prostate cancer susceptibility allelesFull size table","To date there is no reliable way of predicting whether prostate cancer will be an aggressive, fast-growing disease or a non-aggressive, slow-growing type of cancer. In general, a combination of tumor staging (using the tumor, node, metastasis staging system [22]), tumor grading (using the Gleason scoring system [23]) and diagnostic PSA serum levels are used to classify patients into different prognostic risk groups to guide clinicians in treatment decisions. In genetic association studies, patients with prostate cancer are commonly classified as having a more aggressive form of the disease if they fulfill any of the following criteria: (1) disease spread outside of the prostate gland, or presence of cancer in the lymph nodes or other metastatic sites; (2) presence of poorly differentiated cancer as indicated by a high Gleason score (that is, 4 + 3 = 7 or higher); or (3) a serum PSA level associated with a high likelihood of extensive disease (that is, >20 ng/ml).Several studies have explored the capacity of established prostate cancer risk variants to distinguish between less aggressive and more aggressive disease [9–13, 24–46]. Overall, results are inconclusive, with some studies reporting stronger associations for some of these variants among patients with more aggressive prostate cancer, while others did not. In a large replication study from the PRACTICAL (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome) consortium, which evaluated genetic variants at chromosome 3p12, 6q25, 7q21, 10q11, 11q13, 19q13 and Xp11 among 7,370 prostate cancer cases and 5,742 controls, no association with tumor grade was observed for any of the explored variants [45]. Fitzgerald and coworkers assessed the same seven variants and an additional six variants at chromosome 7p15, 8q24, 10q26, and 17q12 in a population-based study comprising 1,308 cases and 1,267 controls for association with family history and clinical features of more aggressive disease [46]. No association was observed between any of the evaluated risk variants and a composite measure of disease aggressiveness; however, two variants, rs10993994 at 10q11 (P = 0.02) and rs5945619 at Xp11 (P = 0.03), were nominally significantly associated with Gleason score.Most of the published studies exploring established risk variants with respect to prostate cancer aggressiveness have had several limitations, including small sample size, heterogeneous definition of aggressive disease across multiple study populations, and reliance on clinical grading and staging of tumors. To address these limitations, Kader and coworkers evaluated 20 established risk variants in 17 distinct genomic regions among 5,895 patients with prostate cancer who were of European descent and who underwent radical prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer [47]. Based on the entire prostate gland, each tumor was uniformly graded and staged using the same protocol. Tumors with pathologic Gleason scores of 4+3 or higher, or pathologic stage of T3b or higher, or non-organ confined disease, were defined as more aggressive disease (N = 1,253); tumors with organ confined disease, pathologic Gleason score of 3+4 or lower, and pathologic stage of T2 were classified as less aggressive disease (N = 4,233). For 18 of the 20 variants explored, no significant difference was observed in risk allele frequencies between patients with more aggressive and less aggressive disease. Two variants were significantly associated with disease aggressiveness: SNP rs2735839 downstream of the kallikrein 3 gene (KLK3; P = 8.4 × 10-7), which is the gene coding for PSA; and SNP rs10993994 in the microseminoprotein β gene (MSMB; P = 0.046). To reduce the possible impact of heterogeneity in the definition of aggressive disease, risk variants were also tested for association with Gleason score and pathological stage separately. SNP rs2735839 in the KLK3 gene (P = 7.7 × 10-6) and SNP rs10993994 in the MSMB gene (P = 0.02) were the only variants associated with Gleason score. For tumor stage, only SNP rs2735839 in the KLK3 gene was significant (P = 1.9 × 10-4). Of note, for both of these variants, the alleles that are associated with increased risk for prostate cancer were more frequent in patients with less aggressive disease. Since these risk alleles have been shown to strongly associate with higher PSA levels among population controls [28, 48, 49], it is possible that the observed association with aggressive disease may partly reflect a PSA detection bias.It should be noted that the lack of association between established prostate cancer risk variants and disease aggressiveness does not imply non-existence of such genetic variants in the genome. All susceptibility variants identified to date were discovered using case-control designs comparing unaffected individuals with all types of patients with prostate cancer. It has been argued that a more effective design to identify genetic variants associated with aggressive disease should involve a case-case design contrasting patients with more and less aggressive disease. Support for this idea was recently provided in a study including 4,829 patients with more aggressive disease and 12,205 patients with less aggressive disease from seven study populations [50]. Initially, publicly available genotype data for approximately 27,000 genetic variants across the genome were explored for association with disease severity among patients with prostate cancer from four populations examined in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility study using a case-case design. A subset of variants (n = 74), showing association within each Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility study, and where the direction of association was consistent among all four studies, was selected for further evaluation in an additional three study populations from Sweden and the USA. This revealed one genetic variant (rs4054823 at 17p12) for which the TT genotype was consistently higher among patients with more aggressive compared with less aggressive disease in each of the seven populations studied (overall P = 2.1 × 10-8 under a recessive genetic model). If confirmed in independent study populations, this finding is of great importance, not because of immediate clinical utility, but as a proof of principle that genetic variants predisposing to more aggressive prostate cancer exist.","In contrast to exploring inherited genetic variants associated with aggressiveness of disease at time of diagnosis, only a few studies have assessed the importance of established risk variants on prostate cancer progression and prognosis.Only one study has explored confirmed risk variants in relation to prostate cancer progression. Among 320 patients who were recruited from three hospitals in Taiwan where they were treated with radical prostatectomy, Huang and co-workers explored association between 20 prostate cancer risk variants and biochemical failure defined by recurrence of PSA [51]. During a mean follow-up of 38.5 months, biochemical failure occurred in 113 (35%) of the patients. In univariate analysis, three risk variants (rs1447295 at 8q24, and rs7920517 and rs10993994 at 10q11) were associated with PSA recurrence. Interestingly, these associations remained significant after adjusting for established prognostic factors such as age, preoperative PSA level, tumor stage, Gleason score, and surgical margin, suggesting that these variants may improve prediction of PSA recurrence among patients treated with radical prostatectomy. Further studies are required to validate these findings.Penney and co-workers [52] explored eight genetic variants at chromosome 8q24, 17q12, and 17q24.3 for association with prostate cancer mortality in three US prostate cancer study populations comprising a total of 6,460 patients of which 493 died as a result of prostate cancer during follow-up. None of the explored variants was associated with prostate cancer mortality, neither in analysis contrasting lethal cases with long-time survivors (alive over 10 years after diagnosis), nor in survival analysis among all patients. The total number of risk alleles was also not associated with prostate cancer mortality.A prospective population-based cohort study of Swedish patients with prostate cancer explored the association between 16 established risk variants and prostate cancer mortality [52]. In total, 2,875 patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003 were followed up for prostate cancer mortality through January 2008. Overall, 626 (21%) of the patients died during follow-up and of those 440 (15%) had prostate cancer classified as their underlying cause of death. No association between any of the explored variants and prostate cancer mortality was observed, either in exploring individual variants or in assessing the cumulative effect of all variants.Additional studies in large populations are needed to comprehensively explore possible associations, although current evidence suggests that established risk variants are not risk factors for prostate cancer outcome."
1,Mobilizing diversity: transposable element insertions in genetic variation and disease,"In the 60 years since Barbara McClintock first discovered transposable elements (TEs), it has become increasingly recognized that these mobile sequences are important components of mammalian genomes and not merely 'junk DNA'. We now appreciate that these elements modify gene structure and alter gene expression. Through their mobilization, transposons reshuffle sequences, promote ectopic rearrangements and create novel genes. In rare cases, TE insertions which cause mutations and lead to diseases both in humans and in mice have also been documented. However, we are at the very earliest stages of understanding how mobile element insertions influence specific phenotypes and to the extent to which they contribute to genetic diversity and human disease.TEs are categorized into two major classes based on their distinct mechanisms of transposition. DNA transposons, referred to as Class II elements, mobilize by a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism in which the transposon is excised from a donor site before inserting into a new genomic location. These elements are relatively inactive in mammals, although one notable exception is a piggyBac element recently identified to be active in bats ([1], R Mitra and N Craig, personal communication). In humans, DNA transposons represent a small fraction (3%) of the genome [2]. Retrotransposons, also known as Class I elements, mobilize by a 'copy-and-paste' mechanism of transposition in which RNA intermediates are reverse transcribed and inserted into new genomic locations. These include long terminal repeat (LTR) elements such as endogenous retroviruses, and non-LTR retrotransposons. Endogenous retroviruses are remnants of viruses that have lost the ability to re-infect cells. These elements, which comprise 8% of the human genome, perform reverse transcription in cytoplasmic virus-like particles [2]. In contrast, non-LTR retrotransposons undergo a distinct mechanism of transposition whereby their RNA copies undergo reverse transcription and integration through a coupled process that occurs on target genomic DNA in the nucleus [3–5].Of all mobile element families, only the retrotransposons remain actively mobile in the human and primate genomes and serve as ongoing sources of genetic variation by generating new transposon insertions. LINEs (long interspersed nucleotide elements) represent the most abundant autonomous retrotransposons in humans, accounting for approximately 18% of human DNA. Non-autonomous elements such as SINEs (short interspersed nucleotide elements) and SVAs [hybrid SINE-R-VNTR (variable number of tandem repeat)-Alu elements] require LINE-1 (L1) encoded proteins for their mobilization [2, 6–9]. Together, SINEs and SVA elements occupy ~13% of the human genome.It is both impressive and puzzling that almost half of our genome is composed of these repeat sequences. Evolutionary paradigms dictate that useless elements and harmful TE insertions events should be selected against, while beneficial insertions should gain a selective advantage and thus be retained. Indeed, the most successful transposons have co-evolved with their hosts. Most transposable element insertions are expected to have few consequences for the host genome and, therefore, have little to no impact on gene function [10]. Rarely, transposon insertions will have a deleterious effect on their host genome, resulting in human disease. To date, approximately 65 disease-causing TE insertions (due to L1, SVA and Alus) have been documented in humans [11]. Less frequently recognized are instances in which transposons have made innovative contributions to the human genome. In these cases, mobile element sequences have been co-opted by the host genome for a new purpose. For example, approximately 150 human genes have been derived from mobile genetic sequences [2, 12, 13]. Perhaps the best studied example of a domesticated transposon is the RAG1 endonuclease, which initiates V(D)J recombination leading to the combinatorial generation of antigen receptor genes. The RAG endonucleases have been demonstrated to function as transposases in vitro, providing strong support for the idea that the V(D)J recombination machinery evolved from transposable elements [14–16].In this review, we examine mechanisms of transposon regulation and discuss how TE insertions account for genetic diversity in the germline and in somatic cells. Traditional methods and recently developed technologies for identifying these insertions will also be considered.","Expansion of mobile elements occurs when de novo insertions are transmitted through the germline to subsequent generations. Indeed, successful metazoan transposons often show germline-restricted expression. As TEs pose a significant threat to genome integrity, uncontrolled activation of these elements would imperil both the host and the element. It appears that, as a consequence, metazoan genomes have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to limit the mobilization of these elements.DNA methylation is, perhaps, the most well understood mechanism involved in the regulation of TEs in the germline of plants, fungi and mammals [17–20]. Cytosine methylation silences LTR and non-LTR elements by blocking transcription of retrotransposon RNA. Host suppression mechanisms appear to function post-transcriptionally as well. For example, the premature termination of transcription and alternative splicing inhibits expression of LINE-1 elements [21, 22]. A family of RNA/DNA editing enzymes with cytosine deaminase activity known as APOBECs (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) has been found to inhibit LINE-1, Alu, and mouse IAP (intracisternal A particle) elements [23]. Interestingly, suppression of retrotransposons by APOBECs does not require any editing activity, suggesting that these proteins may carry out a novel function in addition to their ability to act as cytosine deaminases. Several groups have proposed that APOBECs may sequester retrotransposon RNA in cytoplasmic complexes, although additional studies are warranted in order to prove this hypothesis [24, 25]. RNA interference is believed to control retrotransposition [26], although the observed effect in mammalian cells in vitro is modest [27, 28].Recently, a novel form of mobile element control has emerged that involves small RNAs in germ cells [29]. At the heart of this pathway is a class of small RNAs [piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs)] that bind to the germline-restricted Piwi subclass of the Argonaute family of RNA interference effector proteins. In Drosophila, piRNAs are enriched in sequences containing retrotransposons and other repetitive elements. Disruption of Piwi proteins results in the reduction in piRNA abundance and transposon derepression [30, 31]. A series of elegant studies in Drosophila and zebrafish directly implicated Piwi proteins in piRNA biogenesis to maintain transposon silencing in the germline genome [32–34]. These findings have led to the idea that piRNAs might immunize the Drosophila germline against potentially sterilizing transposition events [32, 35].Mutations in two mouse Piwi orthologues (Mili and Miwi2) result in the loss of TE methylation in the testes, transposon derepression and meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis [36, 37]. Interestingly, the mouse MAELSTROM (MAEL) protein was found to interact with MILI and MIWI in the germline-specific structure nuage[38], suggesting that MAEL may also function in this pathway. Nuage (French for 'cloud') is a perinuclear electron-dense structure found in the germ cells of many species [39]. In flies, Mael is required for the accumulation of repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and repression of TEs [40]. Soper et al. demonstrated that loss of Mael leads to germ cell degeneration (at the same point in meiosis as Mili and Miwi2 mutants) and male sterility in mice [41]. In addition, they provided evidence that the mammalian MAEL protein is essential for the silencing of retrotransposons and determined that early meiosis is a critical timepoint when transposon control is established in the male germline. More recently, a similar role for another germ cell protein, GASZ, has been uncovered [42]. Given that MAEL, MILI, MIWI and GASZ all localize to nuage (chromatoid body in mammals), this structure is likely where the piRNA pathway defends the germline genome from the invasion of unchecked transposable elements.","New retrotransposon insertions arising in or passing through the germline can lead to constitutional genetic diseases in humans, although these are uncommonly recognized events. Not surprisingly, it is the TE families most actively propagating themselves in the human genome that are found to cause these diseases, namely and in order of prevalence, Alu s, L1 s and SVAs.As a result of male hemizogosity for the X chromosome, loss-of-function mutations affecting boys have been disproportionately described. Examples include numerous Alu and L1-induced coagulopathies by disruption of coagulation factor VIII or factor IX [43, 44], Alu and SVA insertions causing immunodeficiency by disrupting BTK [45] and LINE-1 insertions in the large dystrophin locus resulting in muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies [46–48].Autosomal transposon insertions leading to human disease have also been described. These tend to phenocopy otherwise autosomal dominant diseases caused by mutation of the transposon target locus. Examples include an intronic Alu insertion disrupting function of the NF1 tumour suppressor and causing clinical neurofibromatosis [49] and a small number of independent Alu insertions affecting fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and causing malformations with craniosynostosis categorized as Apert syndrome [50, 51].Thus, while most de novo insertions are likely to be passed on as phenotypically silent repeats, it is well established that transposon insertions are relevant to human clinical genetics and can have severe phenotypic consequences in rare cases [52, 53]. There remains significant speculation about whether our understanding of this is limited by the technical difficulties in detecting these sequences (discussed below) or if retrotransposition is indeed effectively prevented so that de novo insertions uncommonly underlie human disease.","There is a widely accepted belief that truly 'selfish' genetic elements must mobilize selectively in the germline or during early development in order to guarantee their evolutionary success. However, recent evidence from several laboratories challenges this notion. Belancio and colleagues reported that both full-length and processed L1 transcripts are detected in human somatic tissues as well as in transformed cells [54]. Kubo and colleagues demonstrated that L1 retrotransposition occurs in a low percentage of primary fibroblasts and hepatocyes when an adenoviral delivery system is employed to express the L1 element [55]. Additionally, L1 somatic retrotransposition events have been discovered in blastocysts from transgenic mouse and rat models expressing a human L1 element [56]. These data suggest that L1 elements contribute to somatic mosaicism. The proposed model is that L1 RNA transcribed in germ cells is carried over through fertilization and then integrates during embryogenesis. At least one case of human disease appears traceable to a similarly timed insertion in a mosaic mother who transmitted the insertion to her child [57]. Somatic insertions have also been identified in mouse models expressing a synthetic mouse L1 element [58]. However, in these studies the elements are expressed from heterologous promoters.Gage and colleagues reported that L1 retrotransposition occurs in cultured mouse neuronal progenitor cells and in a mouse model harboring a human L1 element [59]. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that L1 retrotransposition events might contribute to neuronal plasticity and, perhaps, individuality. In a recent follow-up study, Gage and colleagues detected an increase in the copy number of endogenous L1 in several regions of the adult human brain compared to the copy number of these elements in liver or heart genomic DNA from the same person [60]. In some cases, the brain samples contained ~80 additional copies of L1 sequence per cell. The functional consequences of these findings are, as yet, unknown and many questions remain regarding whether these brain-specific L1 insertions could potentially affect neuronal cell function. Despite these unanswered questions, interesting parallels can be drawn between neuronal cell diversity and the immune system. Namely, immune cells are the only other somatic cell type known to undergo an orchestrated genomic sequence-level alteration process whereby genes that encode antibodies are shuffled to create a host of antibodies that recognize a large number of antigens. Given that the human nervous system embodies a seemingly equally astounding degree of complexity and variability, it is possible that L1 mobilization may play a role in somatic cell diversity. Yet, dysregulation of transposon control mechanisms in the brain might also contribute to neurologic disease.The extent to which TE insertions may generate diversity in somatic cells remains largely unexplored. It remains unclear why transposons do not hop more often in somatic cells. One possibility is that a transposon defense pathway present in somatic cells has yet to be discovered. One potential candidate involved in somatic TE repression might be the P body (processing body), the somatic equivalent of the germline-specific structure nuage. These cytoplasmic structures contain enzymes involved in RNA turnover, including members of the RNA-induced silencing complex. L1 RNA and ORF1 have been shown to accumulate in stress granules, which associate with P bodies in somatic cells [61]. It is tempting to speculate that these structures somehow coordinate repression of TEs in somatic cells, although additional studies are necessary."
2,Genetic polymorphisms of inflammatory molecules in Tunisian inflammatory bowel diseases,"As chemokines and adhesion molecules play a major role in the process by which leukocytes are recruited from the bloodstream into sites of inflammation [1], genetic variation in these production or activity molecules may influence susceptibility to inflammatory diseases [2–4].",To detect a possible association between the functional polymorphisms of these molecules and susceptibility to Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in Tunisian population.,"We have analysed polymorphisms of CCR5-Δ32, CCR5-59029-A/G, CCR2-V64I, MCP-1 G/A (-2518), ICAM-1 G241R, PECAM-1 V125L, E-selectin L554F and L-selectin F206L in 194 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and 169 healthy blood donors using PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSP methods. The patients were classified in 126 patients with CD and 68 patients with UC.","A significant increase in allele frequency of 206L of L-selectin was observed in IBD patients compared with controls (OR: 1.53; 95%CI: [1.05-5.60]; p=0.02) but does not constitute factor influencing clinical manifestations. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of chemokine polymorphisms did not reveal significant differences between patients and controls, and among CD and UC patients. However, analysis of CD patients revealed that those carrying A/A and/or A/G CCR5-59029 genotypes are more frequently in remission compared to those with G/G genotype (OR: 0.4; 95%CI: [0.174-0.928]; p=0.03). Also, the frequency of the 64I CCR2 muted allele was statistically higher in CD patients in remission disease than those in active form (OR: 0.267; 95%CI: [0.09-0.78]; p=0.01). Adjustment for known covariates factors (age, gender and immunosuppressive regimen) confirmed these univariate findings and revealed that the A/G CCR5-59029 and V64I CCR2 genotype were associated to remission form of CD (OR: 2.63 ; 95%CI: [1.01-6.80] ; p=0.047 and OR: 4.64 ; 95%CI: [1.01-21.31] ; p=0.049 respectively)."
3,PGC-1alpha downstream transcription factors NRF-1 and TFAM are genetic modifiers of Huntington disease,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly transmitted, progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' part of the HTT (HD) gene, which is expanded and translated into an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein [1].The length of the expanded CAG tract is inversely related to the age at clinical onset of HD, accounting for more than half of the overall variance in age at onset (AO) [2–4]. Yet, despite this strong correlation, there remains considerable variation in AO (of more than 40 years) in individuals with identical repeat lengths. Evidence has been provided for genetic as well as for environmental factors that affect the AO [5]. Identifying these modifiers in human HD and defining their precise role in the causal pathogenesis of HD could help to develop more effective treatment regimen for HD. To date, several candidate modifier genes of HD have been described in independent studies, all of them implicating a variety of processes apparently contributing to HD pathogenesis [6–10]. Recently, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup H (7028C) and variations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1a (PPARGC1A) gene encoding PGC-1alpha were shown to exert modifying effects on the AO in HD, thus providing genetic evidence that complex interrelations of mitochondrial dysfunction have effects on the pathogenic process in HD [11–14]. A number of studies suggested that PGC-1alpha dysfunction may be central to HD pathogenesis [15]. PGC-1alpha-deficient mice show hyperkinetic movement disorder and striatal degeneration [16, 17]. Gene expression analyses in cell lines, transgenic mouse models of HD and in different tissues from HD patients revealed a disruption of the PGC-1alpha regulatory pathway [18–20]. Recently, investigations on the ability of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to activate PGC-1alpha in brain, liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and muscle of HD transgenic mice strengthened the theory that impaired activation of PGC-1alpha plays an important role in the metabolic disturbances involved in the pathology of HD [20, 21]. Accordingly, modulation of PGC-1alpha levels and activity has been proposed as a therapeutic option for HD pathology [15]. Indeed, activation of the PGC-1alpha signaling pathway via resveratrol-induced activation of the silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1), a mammalian sirtuin, in transgenic mice achieved positive effects in BAT [22]. Yet, PGC-1alpha as a coactivator protein responds to environmental influences and subsequently regulates various pathways in a tissue-specific and highly coordinated manner. Therefore, such pharmacological interventions aimed at PGC-1alpha may suffer from lack of specificity. Targeting key factors of the wide PGC-1alpha transcriptional network could, therefore, represent another approach for a specific modulation of PGC-1alpha activity. PGC-1alpha controls many aspects of oxidative metabolism, including respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis through coactivation and enhancing the expression and activity of several transcription factors including the nuclear respiratory factors (NRF)-1 and NRF-2 (GABP) and the estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) [23, 24]. PGC-1alpha is also indirectly involved in regulating the expression of mtDNA transcription via increased expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) which is coactivated by NRF-1 [23, 25]. In the present study, we addressed the question of the role of a diverse set of PGC-1alpha related factors in modifying the AO of HD. We investigated polymorphisms in the genes encoding ERRalpha (ESRRA), Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), NRF-1 and NRF-2 (NRF-1, GABPA and GABPB1), PGC-1beta (PPARGC1B), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), SIRT1 (SIRT1) and TFAM (TFAM, see Table 1). A more comprehensive understanding of the pleiotropic effects of the PGC-1alpha family regulatory network in mitochondrial biogenesis and HD pathogensis could help to identify and fine tune pharmacological interventions targeting PGC-1alpha or alternatively its transcriptional complexes.Table 1 Candidate gene and SNP characteristicsFull size table","In our cohort of 401 HD patients, the expanded HTT allele accounts for nearly 73% of the variance in motor AO (R2 = 0.729) and shows a highly significant influence on the AO (p < 0.0001). Multiple regression models were used to test all SNPs for association with the AO. Of these, four showed a nominal p-value < 0.05 (Table 2). For NRF-1, addition of the intronic variations rs7781972 and rs6949152 showed an association with the motor AO. Inclusion of the rs7781972 genotypes in the model increased the R2 statistic from 0.729 to 0.733 in both the dominant and the additive model (p = 0.017 and p = 0.011, Table 2). Inclusion of the rs6949152 genotypes increased the R2 from 0.729 to 0.734 (p = 0.004) according to the dominant model and to 0.733 (p = 0.013) in the additive model (Table 2). Examining linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the 15 NRF-1 variations revealed, that the variations rs10275661, rs10225103, rs7781972, rs10268267, rs6962005 and rs6949152 in IVS1 were in high LD in the cohort (D' = 1.0, r2 = 0.87-0.92). In 3' direction the LD breaks down, and a second block of very strong LD (D' = 1.0, r2 ≥ 0.98) is observed for rs10231985, rs11487138 and rs11761434. The remaining SNPs covering exon 2 to IVS10 (rs1882094, rs3735006, rs1962039, rs2402970, rs6948697 and rs10500120) showed lower LD coefficients (D') and r2 values (Figure 1).Table 2 Details of SNPs included in the multivariable modelFull size tableFigure 1Graphical representation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the exon-intron structure (top) and the Haploview pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of part of NRF-1 (bottom).

Haploview plot showing pairwise LD (D' values) for all 15 SNPs based on genotypes of 401 HD patients of the study. Each square plots the level of LD between a pair of SNPs, comparisons between neighboring SNPs are arranged along the first line under the names of the SNPs. Dark grey coloring indicates strong LD, medium grey shading indicates less strong LD, light grey indicates intermediate LD, and white indicates weak LD. LD blocks are framed in black and were classified according to Gabriel et al. (2002).Full size imageIn TFAM two SNPs showed association with motor AO among which, rs11006132 in the 3' region of the gene was most strongly associated (0.729 to 0.733; p = 0.015, Table 2). Including the genotypes of the coding Ser12Thr polymorphism (rs1937) in the model for AO did not increase the R2 statistic. The TFAM variations were in moderate LD with one another (D' < 1.0, r2 = 0.34-0.47), only the associated variations rs1049432 and rs11006132 in the 3' region are highly correlated with each other (pairwise r2 values >0.97). All other selected polymorphisms in NRF2, SIRT1, PGC1beta, MFN2 and PPARgamma showed no significant influence on the AO.After consideration of SNP genotypes individually, a multivariable model was built in order to determine if a significant proportion of the variation in AO could be explained by the joint effect of mitochondrion-related modifier variations and their interactions. NRF-1 and TFAM SNPs showing significant main effects (nominal P < 0.05) together with the previously analysed modifier variations in PPARGC1A (rs7665116) and CO1 (C7028T, defining mt haplogroup H) were included in a multivariable model (Table 2). Here, the main effects together with all possible pairwise interactions of the SNPs were included in a forward selection process. The final multivariable model increased the R2 statistic from 0.729 to 0.747 and explained 4.8% additional residual variance in the motor AO of HD (Table 3).Table 3 SNP-SNP interaction included in final multivariable modelFull size tableWhen correlating the ATP concentrations with the NRF-1 and TFAM genotypes, HD patients carrying at least one rare NRF-1 rs7781972 allele showed significantly lower ATP concentrations (487.1 ± 179 ng, n = 8; 436.7 ± 135.1 ng, n = 4) than homozygous individuals carrying the frequent allele (600.6 ± 48.7 ng, n = 9, p = 0.03; Figure 2). Considering an additive allele effect the ATP levels were negatively correlated with the rare NRF-1 rs7781972 allele (Pearson coefficient -0.478, p < 0.029). Yet, this effect was not obvious in a group of 38 healthy controls (529 ± 175.5 ng, n = 14; 487.4 ± 148 ng, n = 22 vs. 492 ± 120.5 ng, n = 2, Pearson coefficient -0.130, p < 0.437). In both groups the ATP levels were not significantly correlated with the mtDNA:nDNA ratios (HD: Spearman coefficient -0.383, p < 0.095, controls: 0.134, p < 0.417). Regarding the entire patient cohort (n = 401), the mtDNA content was also not associated with age, sex, AO, disease duration, CAG repeat lengths or any other genotype.Figure 2ATP concentration in HD patients. Box plot shows medians, quartiles and extreme values. The mean ATP levels of HD patients with the TT genotype (600.6 ± 48.7 ng, n = 9) and those carrying at least one rare NRF-1 rs7781972 allele (TA and AA, 487.1 ± 179 ng, n = 8; 436.7 ± 135.1 ng, n = 4) were significantly different (p = 0.03 two-sample t test).Full size image","Here, we performed an association study for AO modifiers of HD, based on a candidate gene approach including variations in PGC-1alpha target genes involved in the regulatory network that controls mitochondrial function. We found that SNPs in NRF-1 and TFAM showed nominally significant association with AO of HD.The NRFs and - most importantly NRF-1 - are potent stimulators of the expression of nuclear genes required for mitochondrial respiratory function [23–25]. NRF-1 directly regulates the expression of several nuclear encoded genes involved in the expression, assembly and functions of the respiratory chain or indirectly regulates the mitochondrion-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit genes by activating TFAM [23–25]. Beyond the transcriptional expression of the respiratory chain NRF-1 is also supposed to control the key components of the protein import and assembly machinery, thus suggesting a broader meaning for NRF-1 in orchestrating events in the mitochondrial biogenesis [26]. Yet, a direct functional effect of the associated polymorphisms remains to be determined. Comparing the mtDNA content with various clinical and genetic parameters of the HD patients did not yield statistically significant results. Yet, the interpretation of these results has to be considered with caution, since expressing the mitochondrial DNA concentration as a ratio to nuclear DNA varies dependent on blood-processing protocols [27].Given the relatively small sample sizes, the additive allele effect of NRF-1 rs7781972 on the ATP levels in HD patients should be regarded as preliminary. Nevertheless, these data could be indicative of genotype-dependent variation in the response to chronic energy stress conditions. Since high-intensity exercise also causes metabolic stress, physical activity on a very high level for prolonged time implies, amongst other effects, increased oxidative stress and the consequences of cellular dysfunction due to insufficient supply of ATP [28]. In this context, it is interesting to note that NFR-1 genotypes - particularly regarding rs6949152 - significantly influence phenotype traits indicative of endurance capacity in humans and their trainability [29].Deviation in the response of certain NRF-1 genotypes on chronic energy stress conditions (endurance exercise training, but also neurodegeneration) could therefore explain the association with the variation in the onset age of HD. The same could apply to the other genotypes, since TFAM, PPARGC1A and mt haplogroups have also been described to be associated with differences in physical capabilities and training-induced effects [30–34]. Recently, Chaturvedi et al. [21] demonstrated that chronic energy deprivation in mice by administering the catabolic stressor β-guanidinopropionic acid increased expression of PGC-1alpha, NRF-1 and TFAM. Yet, this pathway, leading to mitochondrial biogenesis, increased mtDNA and numbers of mitochondria in response to energetic stress, was blocked in HD transgenic mice [21]. Furthermore, when combining the newly detected modifier variations in NRF-1 and TFAM with the previously described modifier variations in PPARGC1A and mt haplogroup H, in our study much more variability in AO can be explained than in seperate analyses. The combination of the polymorphisms defines nearly 5% of the unexplained variance in residual AO in our sample, thus highlighting their coordinately regulated metabolic interplay and the possible involvement in pathogenic HD conditions.The important role of PGC-1alpha in the regulation of mitochondrial function together with the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and HD pathogenesis implies that activation of PGC-1alpha could have critical potential in the treatment of HD. Yet, pharmacological interventions directly aimed at PGC-1alpha have to overcome inherent limitations of targeting a coactivator protein [35]. Therefore, targeting the regulators of PGC-1alpha, as already demonstrated for its down-stream target ERRalpha and the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, may represent an alternative approach [36].","Polymorphisms in NRF-1 and TFAM influence the AO of HD. Furthermore, we have demonstrated evidence for gene-gene (SNP-SNP) interactions among these SNPs and the modifier variations in PPARGC1A and CO1, thus providing further genetic evidence that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in response to energetic stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HD. These data also support the idea that upstream transcriptional activators of PGC-1alpha may be useful in the treatment of HD. However, since no multiple testing correction was applied, caution is necessary in interpreting. Further studies will be necessary to replicate these associations and to elucidate the pathways through which the modifier variations exert their effects on metabolic deficits underlying HD pathogenesis and potentially other late-onset diseases."
