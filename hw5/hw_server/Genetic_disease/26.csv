0,Exploring the role of common regulatory variants in the etiology of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease,"Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a complex disorder with a significant genetic component (heritability ~ 0.8). It is distressingly common: in the United States, approximately 13% of individuals over the age of 65 and 43% of individuals over the age of 85 are estimated to have AD [2011 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer’s Association]. Although specific mutations have been linked to familial forms of AD, mutations in AD candidate genes among LOAD cases are rare. For this reason there is currently great interest in identifying common genetic variants that contribute to this disorder. The goal of the current study is to quantify allele-specific differences in the expression of mRNAs encoding candidate LOAD susceptibility genes in human brain and elucidate the genetic basis for this differential expression. Haplotypes or combinations of genotypes that correlate with mRNA should be useful as markers in future genetic association studies aimed at identifying genes that contribute to AD risk and protection.","We examined the expression of mRNAs for candidate LOAD genes in human brain using a novel PCR/second-generation DNA sequencing-based assay for quantifying allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of mRNA expression. Population distributions of log2AEI ratios were analyzed using a custom mathematical model that yields information concerning the number, locations, and relative contributions of cis-acting regulatory variants that influence mRNA expression.","We determined population distributions of log2AEI ratios for 24 candidate LOAD genes, including ABCA1, ADAM17, AGER, BACE1, BACE2, BDNF, CALHM1, CH25H, CLU, GAB2, GSK3B, LRP1, MAPT, NTRK2, P25, PICALM, PION, PSEN1, PSEN2, SORCS1, SORL, TNFRSF1, TNFRS21 AND TNK1. Among these, 22 genes showed frequent (> 0.1) and significant (> 1.2-fold) allele-specific differences in mRNA expression. Mathematical modeling predicted that individual genes are regulated by one to three cis-acting elements. We are currently working on identifying haplotypes or combinations of genotypes that predict high- or low-levels of mRNA expression for use as markers in genetic association studies. Combining this information with knowledge of the functions of genes within biological pathways implicated in LOAD, will allow predictions of the contributions of specific haplotypes to the disorder. For example, high-expression haplotypes for genes encoding proteins that increase the production of toxic A-beta, are predicted to increase risk of LOAD, while high-expression haplotypes for genes encoding proteins that increase the degradation or clearance of A-beta, are predicted in decrease the risk of LOAD. In addition to simply examining differences in haplotypes frequencies between case and control populations, the ability to classify haplotypes as risk-conferring or protective allows the calculation of polygenic risk scores to each individual in the case and control groups. If our classification scheme has validity, we would expect the mean polygenic risk scores for cases to be higher than controls. Association studies to test these ideas are currently in progress.","We have successfully used a novel high-throughput assay for quantifying common variation in mRNA expression for LOAD candidate genes in human brain and are employing a custom mathematical model to infer the number, contribution and locations of cis-acting regulatory variants that influence mRNA expression. We plan to uses data within a polygenic model for LOAD risk to test the hypothesis that common regulatory variants contribute to the etiology of this disorder."
1,Single center experience in Next Generation Sequencing for genetic diagnosis of Autoinflammatory Disorders (AIDs),Autoinflammatory disorders (AIDs) represent an expanding group of complex diseases characterized by periodic or chronic systemic inflammations. Mutations in more than 15 geneshave been associated with autoinflammatory recessive or dominant syndromes. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has emerged in the last year as new diagnostic tool in this field.,To share data obtained by the use of NGS in a cohort of patients affected by an autoinflammatory disease of undefined origin evaluated at our center.,"In this study we enrolled 158 patients from 2010 to 2014. We developed NGS starting with 11 genes already known to be involved in AID (Panel 1: MVK, MEFV, NRLP12, NRLP3, NOD2, TNFRSF1A and PSTPIP1 and Panel 2: IL1RN, LPIN2, IL36RN, PSMB8). Targeted resequencing was performed using customized panel and analyzed with the MiSeq® sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All variants identified have been confirmed by Sanger sequencing.","48,(73%) of the patients present variants in genes of Panel 1. 32,46% have variants in NLRP3 gene: the most frequent variants are Q705K (56%) and V200M (32%). About 26% have variants in NOD2, the most frequent variant is R702W (25%). 30% have variants in NLRP12, the most frequent variant is F402L (65%), in two cases in homozygosity. 23,4% have variants in MEFV, the most frequent variant is E148Q (22%). 4% have variants in MVK, V377I (100%). 10,38% have variants in TNFRSF1A, the most frequent variant is R121Q (75%). 9% have variants in PSTPIP1. 69% of the patients present variant in only one gene; 28,57% present variants in two different genes and two patients in three genes. We performed 15 familial study to unravel the segregation of some variants."
2,"The intracellular signalling pathway signature (the signalome) in PBMCs in the presence of a common TRAPS-associated genetic variant, TNFRSF1A p.(Arg121Gln) (legacy p.R92Q) is distinct from normal PBMCs and from other pathogenic variants","Like other disorders with a strong genetic association, a growing sequence dataset from various autoinflammatory syndrome patients continues to identify many variants of uncertain significance (VUS), i.e. missense and intronic variants or small insertions/deletions, for which the impact on protein function and pathways, and therefore the clinical significance, is unknown. Since it is unclear how these variants are associated with an increased risk of autoinflammatory disease, the clinical management of carriers of VUS is complicated. Therefore, there is a strong demand for reliable tests to rapidly assess the clinical significance of VUS, providing carriers of these variants with the necessary information to make an informed clinical decision and refining treatment by stratified therapy strategies.In many cases, a novel VUS is not common enough to evaluate its significance. Common variants with apparently variable penetrance can be more accessible as a model to test functional aspects. A missense variant in TNFRSF1A rs41495584 (“p.R92Q”) is the most commonly identified variant associated with TRAPS within our mainly Caucasian UK patient population. The aim of this study was to comprehensively examine the intracellular signalling pathways that are affected by the presence of p.R92Q, in comparison to normal cells and to well-known symptomatic variants such as p.C33Y.","PBMCs were collected from patients and healthy volunteers with informed consent. Reverse-phase protein microarray was applied to examine a large number of signalling molecules and inflammatory cytokines, using a feature subset selection process to identify distinctive subsets.","The resulting p.R92Q patient signatures demonstrated that a particular range of inflammation-associated pathways were dysregulated in p.R92Q variant carriers, grouping carriers together and readily distinguishable from normal PBMCs and other known pathogenic variants.","The inflammatory signaling pathways activated by the TRAPS-associated variant p.R92Q are distinctive and provide an opportunity to identify a strategy for correlation of genetic findings and functional analysis. This is applicable to straightforward or subtle phenotypes, and common or rare genetic variants not only in TRAPS, but also in other autoinflammatory diseases such as CAPS, FMF, MKD, Blau syndrome and others. This represents an important step towards genetic-bioinformatic disease portraits with statistical and clinical relevance."
3,Behavioural phenotypes in genetic syndromes: a window on to the biology of behaviour,"A behavioral phenotype (BP) is the characteristic cognitive, personality, behavioral, and psychiatric pattern that typifies a disorder. A number of genetic syndromes have been identified as having this type of distinctive and consistent behaviour pattern.","In this article we aim to illustrate information currently available in the field of behaviour phenotypes. Also described are the brain-behavior relations, and gaining understanding of the genetic bases of behavior.","They were organized by dividing them into three groups according to the biological characteristics recognized to date: a) BP associated to genetic diseases with an identified biological basis (syndromes such as Lesch Nyhan, Rett, fragile X, tuberous sclerosis complex, Noonan, Sotos, Aicardi, Angel man, Prader Willi, Williams, Down, Smith Magenis, Di George, Pallister Killian and Turner, among others; b) BP associated to a genetic disease with an unidentified biological basis (Cornelia de Lange syndrome); and, c) BP with an as yet unidentified biological basis associated to diverse causations (autism). Because of the rarity of many of the syndromes, and the complexity of their genetic basis, there are great difficulties in establishing the validity of the association between syndrome and behavioural phenotype. The combination of molecular genetics, neuroimaging, and behavioral research has advanced our understanding of the linkages between genetic variables, neurobiological measures, IQ, and behaviour.","Although neither the genome nor the environment can be manipulated in research on human behaviour, some of the new tools of molecular genetics can be brought to bear on human behavioural disorders. In addition, because they are the consequences of known genetic alterations, behavioral phenotypes can be potentially highly valuable clues to the identification of genes in the population that are important to determination of cognitive skills or deficits, personality determinants, behavioral abnormalities, or psychiatric disorders."
4,Genetic analysis diagnosed Bardet–Biedl syndrome in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Senior–Løken syndrome,"Senior–Løken syndrome (SLS) and Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) are ciliopathies. SLS is characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and familial nephronophthisis (NPHP), which leads to end-stage kidney disease. BBS is characterized by six major symptoms: RP, polydactyly, obesity, genital abnormalities, learning difficulties, and renal defects. Although some variations in secondary symptoms have been reported, typical secondary symptoms of BBS are as follows: developmental delay, ataxia, poor coordination, speech defects, brachydactyly or syndactyly, dental defects, olfactory deficits, craniofacial dysmorphism, diabetes mellitus, congenital heart disease, hypertension, liver abnormalities, bronchial asthma, otitis, and rhinitis. A patient with more than four major symptoms, or three major symptoms with more than two secondary symptoms, can be definitively diagnosed with BBS [1, 2]. Thus far, ciliopathies have been diagnosed on a phenotypic basis; however, diagnosis can now be established by genetic testing using techniques such as next-generation sequencing. Here, we report a patient clinically diagnosed with SLS but diagnosed with BBS 13 years later using next-generation sequencing.","The female patient was born at term and exhibited a normal birth weight with no apparent congenital malformation. Her parents were consanguineous cousins with no major health problems. From childhood, the patient became easily exhausted and suffered from bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, atopic dermatitis, and secretory otitis media, which required middle ear ventilation at the age of 5 years. Since then, she experienced poor eyesight in the evening and was diagnosed with RP at the age of 6 years. When she was 8 years old, her Rohrer index was 152 indicating pre-obesity, and she experienced right cervical lymphadenopathy and underwent a blood test because of her extremely poor general status. Her inflammatory response was very low; additional blood test results were as follows: urea nitrogen, 70.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 3.0 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 7.4 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 137 IU/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 115 IU/L. Urinary analysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.010 and a urinary beta-2 microglobulin level of > 16,000 μg/L, together with microhematuria and microproteinuria; this indicated end-stage renal failure, anemia, and liver dysfunction. Kidney and liver biopsy procedures revealed renal tubular cysts, tubular membrane disruption, and liver fibrosis. Therefore, SLS was diagnosed, but no NPHP1 mutations were detected.Peritoneal dialysis was begun at the age of 9 years, and she underwent kidney transplantation, with a graft from her father, at the age of 13 years. Before this, from the age of 12 years, she received growth hormone therapy because of her extremely short height (130.4 cm, − 3.5 SD). However, at the age of 13 years, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy was started to increase growth. She exhibited no morphological abnormalities in her genital organs and menarche occurred at the age of 15 years; the development of secondary sex characteristics was rather slow but almost normal. No obvious developmental delay or learning disabilities were evident. Although her behavior was rather childish and caused some difficulties in appropriate social interactions, she learned Braille and obtained a national qualification as a massage practitioner. Hypothyroidism and mild hypertension had been evident since she was an elementary school student, but she did not have diabetes mellitus, central nervous system problems, or anosmia.At the age of 21 years, we obtained written informed consent for genetic testing from the patient and her parents, and this was approved by the ethics board of Osaka Medical College (approval number 1867-01). She underwent genetic testing for most of the mutations associated with ciliopathy; these new tests revealed a homozygous mutation in intron 11 of SDCCAG8 (c.1357-9G>A), which caused splice site changes leading to a frameshift mutation (Fig. 1). The incidence rate of this mutation is extremely rare: 1/66,556 alleles in a genetic database of subjects in North America [3], and no alleles in a genetic database of subjects in Japan [4]. Because the SDCCAG8 mutation can be causative of both SLS and BBS [1, 2, 5,6,7,8], we noted her possibility of having BBS. Considering her RP, pre-obesity, difficulty in appropriate social interactions, juvenile NPHP, liver fibrosis, bronchial asthma, and otitis media, we diagnosed BBS. Her mother was initially confused by this new diagnosis, but eventually appreciated that the difficulties experienced in her daughter’s upbringing were partially caused by the phenotype of BBS.

This patient has a missense mutation in intron 11, resulting in the addition of eight bases (shown in red font)Full size image","We experienced challenges in our attempt to diagnose a patient with BBS, largely because this is a very rare disease. Moreover, most of us are not experts in the diagnosis of BBS and we have not treated other patients with BBS before. The primary diagnostic criteria for BBS are phenotypic in nature, but blindness and end-stage kidney disease affect the interpretation of other diagnostic phenotypes. For example, blindness may affect a patient’s social characteristics and learning abilities, thereby making it difficult for them to read or befriend other children; moreover, kidney disease can lead to obesity in association with malnutrition, overeating and/or drinking, and a lack of exercise. Therefore, it is difficult to know whether these symptoms are caused by blindness, kidney disease, or overall manifestations of BBS. Moreover, some forms of symptomatic treatment may make phenotypes more difficult to clearly discern. For instance, when growth hormone therapy was administered to our patient, it may have interfered with obesity, while luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy could have made some genital abnormalities less prominent. Furthermore, BBS is a progressive disease, and most cases are diagnosed in older patients.Mutations in SDCCAG8 (NPHP10/BBS16) are causative of both SLS and BBS without polydactyly. However, SDCCAG8 mutations are quite rare, with only 1–3% of BBS cases exhibiting a causative mutation in SDCCAG8 [1, 2, 5]. In this case, we first clinically diagnosed the patient’s disease as SLS [6,7,8]. However, after next-generation sequencing revealed a mutation in SDCCAG8, we reviewed her phenotype and finally diagnosed BBS. The childish character, difficulty in social interactions, and pre-obesity (body mass index, 27) the patient had suffered from since childhood are major symptoms of BBS in addition to RP and NPHP. Additionally, she displayed some secondary symptoms including liver fibrosis, bronchial asthma, and otitis media. However, these symptoms are not limited to BBS. Moreover, patients harboring a mutation in SDCCAG8 lack polydactyly which is a major symptom of BBS [5]. Thus, a differential diagnosis of BBS would not have been possible without genetic analysis.Severe developmental delay or obesity is thought to be rare in cases of BBS with a SDCCAG8 mutation. Additionally, considering the absence of polydactyly and the patient’s age at the time of sight loss and the development of end-stage renal disease, her phenotype was compatible with this diagnosis [5, 7]. We suspect that many SLS patients harboring a mutation in SDCCAG8 may actually suffer from BBS, so are likely to remain misdiagnosed. Therefore, we urge clinicians to carefully monitor SLS patients to determine if BBS-associated complications emerge. Furthermore, as additional cases of SDCCAG8 mutations are reported, BBS professionals can stratify characteristics associated with SDCCAG8 mutation phenotypes; in contrast, BBS patients could be sub-classified based on mutations rather than on phenotypes.In conclusion, we describe a Japanese female patient with ciliopathy harboring a mutation in SDCCAG8. At first, she was diagnosed with SLS, but subsequent genetic testing and detailed phenotypic observations strongly supported a re-diagnosis of BBS. Because only a few cases of SDCCAG8 mutations have been reported previously of which none exhibit polydactyly, it is difficult for general pediatricians to confidently diagnose BBS. We propose that general pediatricians or physicians should perform genetic testing of NPHP patients, with informed consent of the patient and/or parents, and that those with SDCCAG8 mutations should be carefully monitored to determine if they develop SLS or BBS-associated complications. Reporting of additional cases will help clarify phenotypic characteristics associated with SDCCAG8 mutations and may determine whether there is a need for new groupings based on genetic mutations rather than phenotypes. These changes will contribute to improved management of patients with ciliopathies.","NPHP and NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC)NPHP is a ciliopathy characterized by the presence of small cysts in the cortico-medullary border legion of the kidney and histologically progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. NPHP almost always causes end-stage kidney disease and is the cause of 5–10% of all end-stage kidney diseases in pediatric patients. Although most cases of NPHP are thought to be caused by a single mutation, the causative mutation has only been detected in 40% of all NPHP patients with the remainder being unidentified. Approximately 10–20% of NPHP patients have extrarenal symptoms such as SLS and BBS, so are diagnosed with NPHP-RC [6, 8,9,10,11]. Because a single mutation associated with a disease in NPHP-RC often causes another disease, a definitive diagnosis is difficult for many general pediatricians. Therefore, some experts regard NPHP-RC as a comprehensive disease.SLSSLS is characterized by NPHP and RP and accounts for 10% of NPHP and NPHP-RC cases [6, 8,9,10,11]. SLS patients who are not blind from birth are described as having the late-onset form of disease. Such patients typically have night blindness then develop blindness during school age. Juvenile nephronophthisis is common, and end-stage kidney disease occurs by the age of 13 on average.BBSBBS is defined as six major symptoms: RP, polydactyly, obesity, genital abnormalities, learning difficulties, and renal defects, and several secondary symptoms also occur. A patient with more than four major symptoms, or three major symptoms with more than two secondary symptoms, can be definitively diagnosed with BBS [1, 2]. Of the major symptoms, polydactyly is a symbolic symptom of BBS but this occurs in only 63–81% of all BBS patients [1]. Obesity and learning difficulty are not specific for BBS. Genital abnormalities are symbolic for BBS boys because most are sterile, while BBS girls sometimes have genital anomalies but menarche is not typically early or late. BBS is therefore often difficult to diagnose in girls because they lack two typical symptoms of BBS.
SDCCAG8
SDCCAG8, encoding serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8, is also known as NPHP10 or BBS16. A mutation in SDCCAG8 is causative of both SLS and BBS [1, 2, 5,6,7,8]. However, only 1–3% of all BBS patients harbor SDCCAG8 mutations [1, 2, 5, 7, 8].Therefore, SLS and BBS patients carrying a SDCCAG8 mutation lack any consistent pattern of symptoms except that none have polydactyly. Although only 10–20% of NPHP patients have extrarenal symptoms, most NPHP patients with SDCCAG8 mutations have multiple extrarenal symptoms (Table 1). Therefore, careful monitoring of extrarenal symptoms by general physicians is needed. The concepts of SLS, BBS, and NPHP-RC patients carrying SDCCAG8 mutations are shown in Fig. 2.

Major symptoms of SLS, BBS, and NPHP-RC patients carrying SDCCAG8 mutations are described. No polydactyly has been reported among NPHP-RC patients with SDCCAG8 mutations. Asthma and otitis media are common symptoms of ciliopathy and are frequently reported in NPHP-RC patients with SDCCAG8 mutations. NPHP, nephronophthisisFull size image"
5,Genetic modifiers in carriers of repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene,"Two fatal neurodegenerative diseases, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND), demonstrate clinical, pathological and genetic overlap. In up to 50% of FTD patients, for instance, signs of motor neuron dysfunction are present and an equal percentage of MND patients can show cognitive symptoms of frontal lobe impairment [1–4]. Moreover, inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are the most common subtype of FTD and are also a pathological hallmark of MND [5, 6]. Interestingly, hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene have been identified in FTD and MND [7, 8], representing the most frequent genetic cause of both diseases [9]. Considerable clinical variability, however, has been detected in carriers of these expansions, including heterogeneity in age at onset and disease duration [10]. While recent studies implicated variants in transmembrane protein 106 B (TMEM106B), intermediate repeats in ataxin-2 (ATXN2), C9ORF72 expansion size, and the presence of double mutations as genetic modifiers of the clinical presentation in C9ORF72 expansion carriers [11–15], it remains largely unknown why some individuals develop disease symptoms in their 40s whereas others remain unaffected until old age.In C9ORF72 expansion carriers, FTD and/or MND-associated variants that modify disease risk, age at onset or survival after onset have not been studied systematically. For this reason, we conducted a thorough literature search and included 36 known variants in our study. These variants were investigated in a cohort of 330 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 374 controls; importantly, we identified eight potential disease modifiers that may aid in explaining the reported phenotypic heterogeneity.","We investigated a cohort of 330 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 374 controls for 36 variants known to modify disease risk, age at onset or survival after onset in FTD and/or MND (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1). For simplicity, we have included an overview of significant associations, displaying only the genotypic model for which evidence of association was strongest (Table 2); results of all genotypic models for analyses that contained significant associations are shown in the supplement (Additional file 1: Table S2 [age at onset] and Additional file 1: Table S3 [survival after onset]).Table 1

                        Variants significantly associated with age at onset or survival after onset
Full size tableOur primary analysis focused on the 265 probands carrying C9ORF72 repeat expansions with FTD, FTD/MND, or MND. Under a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%, none of the variants studied was significantly associated with disease risk, neither in our overall group nor in any of our disease subgroups. Age at onset analysis, however, revealed three significant associations in our overall group (Table 2; Figure 1). Each additional minor allele of rs7018487 (ubiquitin-associated protein 1 [UBAP1]) was associated with a decrease in mean age at onset of 2.62 years (p-value = 0.003; additive genotypic model). For rs6052771 (prion protein [PRNP]), the mean age at onset was 4.42 years later in probands with two copies of the minor allele, than in probands with at least one copy of the major allele (p-value = 0.003; recessive genotypic model). Probands carrying at least one copy of the minor allele in rs7403881 (metallothionein 1 E [MT-Ie] haploblock), demonstrated a delay of 3.95 years in mean age at onset as compared to probands homozygous for the major allele (p-value = 0.003; dominant genotypic model). We did not detect significant associations for any of the disease subgroups.Figure 1Associations with age at onset in the overall group of FTD, FTD/MND, and MND probands. Three variants are shown that demonstrate a significant association with age at onset in C9ORF72 expansion carriers (rs7018487:T > G [UBAP1; panel A], rs6052771:A > G [PRNP; panel B], and rs7403881:G > C [MT-Ie; panel C]). In each panel, the mean in the given group is denoted by a solid horizontal line; associations are specified in Table 2 and genotype frequencies in Additional file 1: Table S1.Full size imageIn the 221 FTD, FTD/MND, and MND probands with information available regarding survival after onset, median follow-up length after onset was three years (range: 4 months – 24 years [FTD: 1 year – 24 years, FTD/MND: 10 months – 24 years, MND: 4 months – 9 years]). The survival after onset analysis resulted in significant associations with six variants (Table 2). Of those associations, one was present in our overall group, three were present in our FTD subgroup, and two were present in our MND subgroup. When concentrating on our overall group (Table 2; Figure 2), we noted a significant association only for rs5848 (granulin precursor [GRN]; relative risk [RR] = 1.64; p-value = 0.001; additive genotypic model). However, we also performed an additional analysis to evaluate the combined effect of two other variants, rs13268953 and rs6985069 (elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 3 [ELP3]; not in linkage disequilibrium [LD]), on survival after onset, especially because these variants both showed non-significant trends towards an association and were located near the same gene. When combining these variants, we did detect a significant association with survival after onset (p-value = 0.001; Additional file 1: Table S4).Figure 2Variants significantly associated with survival after onset. Six significant associations with survival after onset are presented (rs5848:G > A [GRN; panel A], rs7403881:G > C [MT-Ie; panel B], rs13268953:A > G [ELP3; panel C], the epsilon 4 allele:E4- > E4+ [APOE; panel D], rs12608932:A > C [UNC13A; panel E], and rs1800435G > C [ALAD; panel F]). When three curves are shown (rs5848), zero copies of the minor allele are displayed in black, one copy of the minor allele is displayed in blue, and two copies of the minor allele are displayed in red. If two curves are present (other variants), then the common genotype is shown in black and the rare genotype is shown in blue.Full size imageIn our disease subgroups (Table 2; Figure 2), we observed significant associations in our FTD probands for rs7403881 (MT-Ie; RR = 3.81; p-value = 0.001; recessive genotypic model), rs13268953 (ELP3; RR = 3.65; p-value = 0.003; recessive genotypic model), and the epsilon 4 allele (apolipoprotein E [APOE]; rs429358 and rs7412; RR = 3.13; p-value = 0.004; dominant genotypic model). In our MND probands, significant associations were found for rs12608932 (unc-13 homolog A, C. elegans [UNC13A]; RR = 5.65; p-value = 0.003; recessive genotypic model) and rs1800435 (delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase [ALAD]; 0.0% death in carriers of minor allele versus 15.9% in non-carriers; p-value = 0.003; dominant genotypic model).Of note, all results of statistical analyses involving disease risk, age at onset and survival after onset were very similar when including individuals who were family members or who had received another diagnosis, and also when additionally adjusting models for age in the disease risk analysis (data not shown).","This study was designed to help elucidate the clinical variability observed in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. We investigated variants previously implicated in FTD and/or MND, and determined their effects in a unique cohort of subjects with known pathogenic expansions in C9ORF72. Excitingly, we discovered eight variants that may assist in explaining the reported phenotypic variability, especially with regard to age at onset and survival after onset (Table 2). Although it should be stressed that replication is needed, our results represent a major step forward in the search for genetic modifiers, and they provide directions for future validation and meta-analytical studies.We identified one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located near UBAP1 (rs7018487) that was associated with age at onset in our overall group of C9ORF72 expansion carriers (p-value = 0.003). UBAP1 functions in ubiquitin-dependent sorting at the multivesicular body (MVB), and depletion of UBAP1 severely disrupts this complex process [16, 17]. Variants in UBAP1 have already been linked to FTD risk, and colocalization of UBAP1 and TDP-43 in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions has been demonstrated [18]. Our results also revealed an association between PRNP (rs6052771; in LD with rs1799990) and age at onset in our overall group (p-value = 0.003). The contribution of PRNP to the pathogenesis of FTD and/or MND has not been studied thoroughly [19, 20], and consequently, little is known about its effects on these diseases. One study, however, reported an association of PRNP with age at onset in a small number of FTD patients harboring GRN mutations [21], supporting the premise of a common underlying mechanism.Moreover, we discovered a variant in metallothionein (rs7403881) that is associated with a delayed age at onset in our overall group (p-value = 0.003). In addition to this delay, we detected a decrease in survival after onset in our FTD subgroup (p-value = 0.001). Currently, only a few studies investigating FTD and/or MND have focused on the metallothionein family, which is involved in antioxidant defense [22]. One of these studies suggested that rs7403881 increases MND risk [23]. A recent study in superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) mice, revealed that overexpression of metallothioneins slows disease progression and extends lifespan [24]. Further evidence for a potential role of oxidative stress is provided by the association between survival after onset and a coding SNP in ALAD (rs1800435; p-value = 0.003). The ALAD enzyme influences susceptibility to lead exposure, which may contribute to MND risk; although studies published thus far are insufficient for a definitive conclusion [25–27].Interestingly, we also found a significant association between a functional SNP in GRN (rs5848; 3’-untranslated region [UTR]) and survival after onset in our overall group. It has already been reported that carriers homozygous for the minor allele of rs5848 demonstrate an increased FTD risk as compared to homozygous major allele carriers [28], but no associations with either FTD risk or age at onset were observed in other studies [21, 29–32]. Thus, although the contribution of GRN SNPs to neurodegenerative diseases has not been elucidated, our present finding suggests that GRN is associated with survival after onset in carriers of C9ORF72 repeat expansions (p-value = 0.001).We also examined two variants near ELP3 (rs13268953 and rs6985069; not in LD). ELP3 is a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, and as such, is involved in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 to make DNA accessible for transcription [33, 34]. Importantly, another type of histone modification has already been implicated in C9ORF72 expansion carriers: a recent report demonstrated that trimethylation of lysine residues within histones H3 and H4 might reduce C9ORF72 expression in expansion carriers [35]. An association study and mutagenesis screen have also exposed associations between ELP3 and MND susceptibility [36], representing one of many FTD and/or MND-associated genes that function in RNA-processing pathways [37]. Our present findings are in agreement with these studies, as shown by the combined effects of these ELP3 SNPs in our overall group (p-value = 0.001), and one ELP3 SNP (rs13268953) in our FTD subgroup (p-value = 0.003).In addition, we assessed APOE, a gene that has been carefully investigated, particularly in patients with dementia. A recent meta-analysis included 28 case–control studies, and demonstrated that the epsilon 4 allele increases susceptibility to FTD [38]. Interestingly, we discovered that the APOE epsilon 4 allele was associated with a decline in survival after onset in our FTD subgroup (p-value = 0.004).Our last potential modifier (rs12608932), an intronic SNP in UNC13A, has been identified through a genome-wide association study in MND patients [39]. This finding was strengthened by an analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that demonstrated genome-wide significance for UNC13A[40]. UNC13A is involved in neurotransmitter release [41], a tightly regulated process that is thought to be disrupted in MND patients. Our results show that variants in UNC13A are also associated with survival after onset in the presence of a C9ORF72 repeat expansion: we detected an association in our MND subgroup (p-value = 0.003).We would like to reiterate that we performed a systematic study of variants reported in the literature. For many variants, however, previous findings were inconclusive and based on our current discoveries we speculate that some of the seemingly conflicting results are due to differences in the composition (and size) of study cohorts, most importantly: (1) the number of patients with predominant FTD, predominant MND or a mixture of both diseases, (2) the percentage of subjects with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis, and (3) the subset of individuals with pathogenic mutations in particular FTD and/or MND-associated genes (such as C9ORF72). Hence, because of our present findings and results of aforementioned studies, reinvestigation of previously published data after exclusion of certain subgroups seems warranted, and new well-sized studies should be performed concentrating on these subgroups, in order to determine the specificity of results.In our study, we used an FDR rather than a family-wise error rate (FWER)-controlling procedure for multiple testing adjustments. The FDR procedure is relatively new, and controlling the FDR is a valid method to adjust for multiple comparisons [42]. An FDR correction, however, is less conservative than an FWER correction and its interpretation is different (Methods). We used an FDR of 10%, which means that for each group of statistically significant associations we would expect the vast majority (90%) to be real (i.e. for each group only 1 out of 10 significant findings is expected to be false). Naturally, there is always a balance between the two different types of statistical error that can occur for any given conclusion – a type I error (i.e. a false-positive association) and a type II error (i.e. a false-negative association), both of which are undesirable. Because the balance tips more in the direction of type I error for the FDR than for the FWER procedures, it is important to highlight that our results, though promising, do require validation.Additionally, it should be noted that we focused our article on those associations that remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing. Future studies could investigate nominally significant associations (Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 1: Table S3) in larger cohorts and/or meta-analyses, to determine whether any of these potential associations contribute to the pleiotropy detected in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Other studies could also concentrate on variants not included in our present study (i.e. recently published variants); especially since it seems plausible that more variants (either known or unknown) modify the phenotype of C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Furthermore, our study was designed to investigate associations with disease risk (i.e. by comparing patients and controls) and to identify factors that could modify age at onset or survival after onset. Interestingly, some of the associations we observed were only significant in the phenotypic subgroup for which the risk variant was originally reported; for example, APOE genotypes only affected survival after onset in our subgroup of C9ORF72 expansion carriers with FTD, whereas the UNC13A variant only affected survival after onset in our MND subgroup. To further investigate the clinical phenotype, a larger number of expansion carriers with either FTD or MND is needed (e.g. international genome-wide association study), so that direct comparisons of expansion carriers with FTD and MND could be performed.","Our present study reveals eight variants that may account for the phenotypic variability reported in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. These variants strongly emphasize the importance of proper protein degradation, antioxidant defense, and processing of RNA. Although identified genes (and their corresponding pathways) have already been linked to FTD and/or MND, it was unclear whether they were able to act as disease modifiers on the background of a C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Our findings, thus, underscore the complex interplay between many factors that influence the occurrence and prognosis of these destructive diseases, particularly in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Though large for a study of C9ORF72 expansion carriers, our findings result from a relatively small sample size, and therefore, repeated replication and meta-analyses will be necessary to increase our understanding of these potential genetic disease modifiers. With that said, the factors identified in this study may represent excellent targets for novel treatments, including preventative treatment strategies, and for the development of predictive tests aiming at the continuum of FTD and MND."
6,Genetic susceptibility to psoriasis: an emerging picture,"Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease that affects approximately 2% of the population worldwide [1]. Most cases (75%) of chronic plaque psoriasis first present before the age of 40 years - known as early-onset or type I psoriasis - and late-onset cases presenting after the age of 40 years are classified as type II psoriasis [2]. The higher concordance rate in monozygotic twins (65 to 73% compared with 15 to 30% for dizygotic twins) suggests that psoriasis is a typical complex disease in which both genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility [3–6]. Family-based analyses of patients with psoriasis and numerous population-based epidemiological studies have also confirmed the genetic basis of the disease [5, 7–12]. From such studies, the heritability of psoriasis (a measure of the proportion of variability of a trait that is due to genetic factors) has been estimated to be 60 to 90% in the Caucasian population [10] and as high as 90 to 100% among Danish twins [13].The importance of genes in psoriasis has long been recognized, and traditional approaches of family-based linkage studies and population-based candidate gene association studies have had some success in identifying genetic risk factors. Although psoriasis was not in the first wave of ground-breaking single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which have signaled a new era in the identification of common variants determining susceptibility to common diseases, this approach is now being applied and it is timely to review current knowledge of psoriasis genetics. As evidenced by studies in other conditions, such as Crohn's disease, for which the key role of autophagy has been discovered using GWASs [14–16], advances in our understanding of the genetic markers involved in the phenotypic expression of this complex disorder will be crucial in providing the next generation of therapeutic targets for psoriasis.","More than 35 years ago, associations with markers within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 were first identified for psoriasis [17] and, to this day, this locus remains the major susceptibility locus for psoriasis, accounting for 35 to 50% of Caucasian genetic susceptibility to early-onset psoriasis [18–20]. Strong associations have been found between familial psoriasis and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes, predominately HLA-Cw6, with a prevalence of up to 85% in early-onset patients compared with 15% in late-onset psoriasis and approximately 10% in the general population [2]. A consistent finding of linkage studies carried out in families with psoriasis was a broad peak over the MHC, designated PSORS1, leading to speculation that the locus could harbor effects additional to those already identified for HLA-Cw6. The strong linkage disequilibrium across this region adds to the difficulties of fine mapping and determination of causal effects. Uncertainty remains as to whether HLA-Cw6 is the causal variant, with other studies implicating different genes [21–24]. Recent evidence seems again to favor a role for HLA-Cw6 in both Caucasians [25] and Chinese families [26], but conditional analysis demonstrated that, although HLA-Cw6 was a major risk allele, it does not fully account for the PSORS1 linkage evidence.Whole-genome linkage screens of psoriasis [27–36] identified many potential susceptibility loci but, with the possible exception of PSORS1, fine mapping of these loci did not reveal convincing evidence for disease susceptibility genes, almost certainly because the studies were under-powered and many of the linkages were false positives. In contrast, recent well powered candidate gene association studies have been more fruitful. Notable successes include the replication of SNPs identified in the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 (rs3789604) [37], the asthma susceptibility gene ADAM33 (rs597980) [38, 39] and in the kinase-associated protein CDKAL1 (rs6908425) [40] in a large US Caucasian cohort of 1,448 psoriasis patients and 1,385 controls [41]. Furthermore, strong association has also been reported between the interleukin gene IL15 and the disease in the Chinese Han population (g.596516, P = 5 × 10-6) [42]. Interestingly, this polymorphism is not associated with psoriasis in any of the UK [43], German [44] or US Caucasian populations [41] investigated, and the minor allele frequency (MAF) for this SNP and others across IL15 differs quite strikingly between the populations, suggesting heterogeneity in the genetic susceptibility to psoriasis.As well as being investigated for any potential functional role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, candidates are increasingly targeted following association with related diseases. Although the MHC locus has long been known to harbor the major susceptibility region for many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, it is increasingly becoming apparent that psoriasis shares other non-MHC susceptibility loci with diseases such as type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis [45]. Of particular interest for psoriasis because of its co-morbidity with the disease are the regions of susceptibility shared with Crohn's disease. The prevalence of psoriasis is reported to be 9.6% among those affected with the chronic inflammatory bowel disease, compared with 2.2% of the controls [46]. Some recent candidate gene studies of psoriasis have adopted the approach of targeting reported Crohn's disease associations and have revealed many overlapping genetic loci common in both diseases [15, 40]. One of these studies investigated 15 established Crohn's disease susceptibility loci in 1,256 psoriasis patients and 2,938 unrelated healthy controls. The same SNPs at three of these loci, 1q24, 6p22 (the CDKAL1 gene also associated with type II diabetes) and 21q22 [40], were significantly associated with psoriasis, with very similar effect sizes and the same risk alleles as those with Crohn's disease [14, 47].In addition to the well validated findings described above, there have been many conflicting reports of association and a frequent failure in replicating initial observations from candidate gene studies, probably reflecting low sample sizes and, therefore, low power to detect what are likely be relatively modest or weak effects. Candidate gene studies may also be considered to be limited as they tend to be hypothesis driven and based on existing knowledge of the disease and its pathogenesis. More recently, the technological advances that allow the high-throughput, accurate, simultaneous genotyping of hundreds of thousands of SNPs has bought a new era of genetic studies in which the whole genome can be systematically screened in a hypothesis-free manner, with the potential to uncover novel susceptibility markers in GWASs.","The GWAS has recently become an extensively used approach as a result of advances in affordable high-throughput SNP genotyping technology and the availability of large patient cohorts and information on over four million validated SNPs with MAFs of at least 1%, which are all publicly available on the HapMap database [48]. The HapMap Project also describes patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between common polymorphisms across the genome, which crucially allows subsets of tagSNPs to be designed, ensuring that common variants will either be directly assayed or strongly correlated with an allele of a single tagSNP or tagSNP haplotype.So far, four psoriasis GWASs have been reported in Caucasian populations [49–52], which have all identified novel psoriasis loci and validated established associations, with MHC-based SNPs in the proximity of the HLA-C region proving most significant. The main findings of the first psoriasis GWAS, involving 1,446 US patients and 1,432 controls, reported association with four variants mapping to two non-MHC genes from the genotyping of 25,215 gene-centric SNPs: IL12B on chromosome 5q and IL23R, a gene encoding an interleukin receptor, on chromosome 1p of the broad PSORS7 locus, identified in early studies [30, 50].Subsequent replication studies and more recent GWASs [49–53] have confirmed IL12B and IL23R as non-MHC genes associated with psoriasis risk. Furthermore, these polymorphisms have been investigated in studies of other diseases, with positive associations reported for inflammatory bowel disease [49, 54], psoriatic arthritis [51], atopic dermatitis [55], asthma [51, 56] and ankylosing spondylitis [57, 58] but no association found with others, such as multiple sclerosis [59] and rheumatoid arthritis [60, 61]. Indeed, the association of IL12B and IL23R with psoriasis has been strongly supported by the observation of increased IL23 in plaques of psoriasis and induction of psoriatic hyperplasia by injection of IL23 into mouse skin. The potential benefits of blocking the effects of the IL12 and IL23 cytokines have been clearly demonstrated, with the human monoclonal antibody ustekinumab found to be an effective treatment for severe psoriasis [62]. Two recently completed large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (PHOENIX I and II) of ustekinumab have demonstrated its effectiveness for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients for up to 52 weeks [63] and 72 weeks of treatment [64]. Although the precise mechanism by which polymorphisms in IL12B and IL23R influence the disease process still requires further clarification, the associations and functional evidence suggest that the IL12/IL23 pathway has a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.The UK GWAS of 408,000 SNPs in an initial 318 psoriasis patients and 288 controls, followed by a validation stage using a further 519 patients and 528 controls, detected a novel association with a cluster of six correlated variants on chromosome 20q13 encompassing the transcription factor gene ZNF313 [65]. One of these variants, rs495337, was subsequently validated in two independent replication sets of German and UK populations [65] with functional evidence supporting a role for ZNF313 as a novel psoriasis susceptibility gene [65]. An independent GWAS of both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis patients also reported novel susceptibility loci for psoriasis [51]. Genotyping 311,398 SNPs in an initial 223 US psoriasis patients and 519 Northern European controls, several novel associations were detected and validated in 577 US psoriasis patients and 737 controls. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the Golgi complex protein COG6, the epidermal differentiation complex region of PSORS4, and a region on chromosome 15q21 all demonstrated strong evidence of association with psoriasis [51]. Recently, a US GWAS of 1,409 psoriasis cases and 1,436 controls, followed up in 5,048 patients and 5,041 controls, has reported further novel loci at IL23A, the zinc finger protein gene TNFAIP3, the TNFAIP3-interacting protein gene TNIP1, IL13 and IL4, suggesting a key role for NF-κB regulation and T-helper2 cells in psoriasis [52].Further to these studies, the first large GWAS undertaken in a Chinese cohort (initial cohort: 1,139 cases and 1,132 controls; validation cohort: 5,182 cases and 6,516 controls) replicated the associations with MHC and IL12B and detected a novel signal within the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster on chromosome 1q21, which encodes key proteins implicated in epidermal terminal differentiation [66]. In conclusion, GWASs have been key in identifying common novel variants and validating existing polymorphisms of large or modest effect size that have been associated with psoriasis. With a large psoriasis cohort forming part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [67] Phase II program, and results expected later this year, it is anticipated that further novel and validated associations will be reported for the disease.","Following on from the abundance of GWAS data generated by SNP-based analysis, recent attention has switched to the variation of gene copy number across the genome, as it is increasingly becoming apparent that associations with common SNPs are unlikely to fully account for genetic susceptibility to complex diseases. Measuring the differences in copy number is complex, with many different types of variation possible, such as insertions and deletions. Consequently, much work is currently focused on refining this technology and characterizing the probes for these variants, so that they can be accurately detected and analyzed. Despite this, psoriasis is one disease in which associations have already been established with copy number variants. One study reported that an increased copy number of the β-defensin-some 8, targeted because of its function of encoding antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune response - a key component of psoriasis pathogenesis - was associated with a significantly increased risk of the disease. This was demonstrated in independent Dutch and German psoriasis cohorts [68]. Furthermore, a linear regression conducted by the authors [68] on the combined cohorts used in the study suggested that each additional copy of the β-defensin gene cluster above two copies significantly increased relative risk by 34%.Another association between copy number variation and the disease has very recently been reported on chromosome 1q21, within the defined PSORS4 locus encompassing the late cornified envelope genes LCE3B and LCE3C. A deletion of a region containing these genes was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of psoriasis. This finding was further supported by single-point analysis of SNP rs4112788, which is in strong LD with the deletion and which also showed strong evidence of association with the disease [69]."
