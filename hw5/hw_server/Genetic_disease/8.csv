0,TRAPPED - an insight into two sisters’ struggle to access treatment for a rare genetic disease,"As a medical student, I have often considered my future career with rose-tinted spectacles. Studying countless diseases and their management, I have imagined that when I gain those magical two letters in front of my name, I will be able to treat whichever patients come my way. I did not appreciate the extent of this naivety until I observed one particular consultation during my rheumatology attachment.“The next patient has TRAPS,” my consultant informed me. I had no knowledge of this disease. “It’s incredibly rare,” she added, explaining that managing this patient had been extremely difficult. I presumed this was due to a lack of effective treatment, as is often the case for rare diseases. The patient, a young lady called Sophia, was called in.It became immediately clear that this was not a “normal” clinic appointment. Instead of discussing symptoms, they talked about funding applications. Listening intently, I gathered that there was a treatment for TRAPS, but instead of the usual recommendations about adherence, Sophia was advised to “make it last”. I was burning with questions.Afterwards, I found out that Sophia would soon have her treatment completely withdrawn, despite desperately needing it. This left me even more bewildered. This was not a side of medicine I had seen before. To make matters worse, her half-sister, Lucy, was in the same situation. I decided to pursue TRAPS further to understand how this could be possible.","Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) is an autosomal dominant auto-inflammatory disorder. It is incredibly rare, with an estimated prevalence of one in a million [1]. Left untreated, patients run the risk of amyloidosis and renal failure [2], a risk magnified by the particular TRAPS mutation the sisters possess.Its rarity, along with its vague and varying clinical presentation, meant that the two sisters suffered with TRAPS for years before they were diagnosed. Recurrent attacks of fever, joint pain and rash led to an initial misdiagnosis of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Sophia. However, years of unsuccessful treatment left her feeling disillusioned, and she eventually stopped attending clinic appointments.The breakthrough moment came when Sophia’s sister, Lucy, was referred to the rheumatology department during a disease flare-up. This was, in fact, the first time a rheumatologist had seen the symptoms in their active state, and the nature of the rash finally became clear. Having met Sophia previously, the consultant was the first to consider a genetic cause, allowing all the pieces of the puzzle to fit together, over a decade after it began.This delay is a common occurrence for TRAPS patients, who often remain “enigmas” for years on end, passed between clinicians at an unsettling rate. However, this was just the beginning for the two sisters, who had unfortunately received a diagnosis with an acronym well suited to their subsequent predicament regarding access to treatment.Unlike many rare diseases, TRAPS does have a licenced treatment. Studies have demonstrated that the IL-1 receptor blocker Anakinra reliably induces and maintains disease remission [2,3,4]. For Sophia and Lucy, Anakinra can truly be described as a wonder drug. However, obtaining it has been an immense struggle for all involved, exposing fundamental flaws in resource allocation for rare diseases.","Funding for rare diseases falls within the remit of NHS England’s Specialised Services (NESS), who publish commissioning policies allowing specialist centres to prescribe drugs and receive reimbursement [5]. Until recently, this meant that patients with TRAPS could receive Anakinra through the National Amyloidosis Centre. After April 2016, however, the policy and funding were withdrawn.With no commissioning policy in place at the time the sisters were diagnosed, the National Amyloidosis Centre submitted several individual funding requests on their behalf. However, these requests were rejected repeatedly by NESS on spurious and inconsistent grounds, including one assertion that TRAPS is too rare, followed by another stating that it is not rare enough. Inadequate trial data was also cited as justification for rejection, despite the evidence base being strong enough for the drug to be licensed, and the rarity of the disease leaving little scope for Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). Adding to the inconsistency was the short-sighted nature of this funding refusal, as Anakinra costs far less than the dialysis that the sisters will almost certainly require if untreated.Repeated rejections from NESS left the sisters and their doctors feeling helpless. Although their nearly life-long mystery had been solved, there appeared to be nothing anybody could do about it, simply because of the rarity of the diagnosis. Had they been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Anakinra would have been funded without question. I can scarcely imagine the sisters’ frustration.At this point, there was, in fact, a peculiar turn of events, as the consultant’s refusal to give up and inspiring dedication to help the sisters led to a small breakthrough. Approaching the producers of Anakinra directly at a conference and ardently describing the sisters’ predicament, she convinced the pharmaceutical company to provide a “compassionate supply” of six months-worth of treatment.For Sophia and Lucy, this was life-changing. For the first time, they were finally able to have a taste of the normal life denied to them by TRAPS. With Anakinra, their disease completely remitted. Sadly, this relief was short-lived. With no clear exit strategy for the end of the six months, the sisters continued to live in uncertainty, with the knowledge that their lifeline would soon be taken away. Adding a more sinister dimension to the situation was the knowledge of the potentially lethal consequences of discontinuing Anakinra once it had been initiated. It was towards the end of these six months that the consultation I saw took place, and it was for this reason that the sisters were advised to take their medication sparingly.Meanwhile, in another turn of events, the treatment has allowed Sophia to be well enough to become pregnant, after unsuccessfully conceiving for over seven years due to active disease. This led to a flurry of requests to the hospital trust, who eventually agreed to fund Anakinra temporarily – for Sophia, until the end of her pregnancy, and for Lucy, until January. This brings us up to today, with these seemingly arbitrary dates looming, and no word of what will happen afterwards. With untiring commitment, the professor at the National Amyloidosis Centre has personally worked on a commissioning policy for TRAPS, hoping to get it approved in time to prevent any need for treatment discontinuation. For now, however, the sisters’ future remains uncertain.","This essay identifies two barriers to treatment for patients with TRAPS. The first is the difficulty making a diagnosis. One way to address this is by advocating a better approach to autoinflammatory disorders. In particular, in the case of intermittent signs and symptoms, enabling patients to initiate follow-up appointments during flares will allow for better assessments. This is a system already in place in some areas, but needs expansion and effective utilisation. Patients should also be advised to photograph intermittent signs; with modern smart phones, this simple piece of advice could have a significant impact.The second barrier described has been that of funding. Taking a wider view, I believe that the commissioning policy model for rare diseases requires reconsideration. Rare diseases are already disadvantaged through lack of awareness and difficulty recruiting patients for trials; a fair approach to resource allocation is required to offset these issues. Resources are, of course, limited, and decisions may unfortunately be partly fuelled by politics. However, this is all the more reason to appeal for sensible, consistent and less short-sighted funding decisions, to ensure that patients do not get caught up in a political crossfire. This approach would be facilitated by further trial data, and so researchers should be encouraged to persevere in this field.This essay also highlights the significant impact that clinicians can have on an individual level. The commitment of dedicated doctors is the only reason the sisters were ever able to obtain treatment. Until policies are changed nationally, this case should encourage doctors to persevere for their patients, however time-consuming and frustrating it may be. For the two sisters, it has resulted in some months of much needed relief. Although the future is uncertain, the relentless work of the clinicians involved means that there is hope for future funding."
1,Inference of disease associations with unmeasured genetic variants by combining results from genome-wide association studies with linkage disequilibrium patterns in a reference data set,"The HLA allele DRB1*04 has been shown to be more strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis than nearby tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [1]. We propose here a method of inferring the effects of an unmeasured genetic variant (such as DRB1*04) using linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures from an independent reference data set (the British 1958 Birth Cohort) to scale and weight the associations of rheumatoid arthritis with tagSNPs in the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) data set, supplied as Problem 1 for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16.","The British 1958 Birth Cohort (B58C) compromises all infants in England, Wales, and Scotland born in one week in 1958. During a follow-up in 2002 to 2004 [2], a cell-line-backed DNA collection was established as a nationally representative reference set for genetic case-control studies. Field protocols and consent forms were approved by the South East England Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee. Genome-wide data from the Illumina HumanHap550 Beadarray on 1430 members of the B58C was deposited by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [3]. In addition, data on HLA typing using Dynal technologies were deposited by the Diabetes & Inflammation Laboratory, Cambridge [4]. Further details about these deposits and the B58C DNA Collection are published online [5].The NARAC data set [6], provided as Problem 1 for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16, consists of individual-level genotype data for 550,000 SNPs tested on the Illumina HumanHap550 Bead Array linked to case/control status for rheumatoid arthritis as well as the HLA alleles at the DRB1 locus. We derived a numerical score to represent the number of DRB1*04 alleles for each individual in both the NARAC and B58C data sets. Association tests between the rheumatoid arthritis case/control status and each tagSNP in the MHC region (chromosome 6; 27-33 Mb [7]) were generated using Stata™ 9.2.We tested whether combining the LD patterns from the B58C and the association patterns from NARAC provide an unbiased estimate the effect of the DRB1*04 allele, using only neighboring tagSNPs (± 300 kb) that are common to both data sets. This application has the advantage that the DRB1*04 allele (our target variant) has been measured directly in both data sets, permitting validity checks between our inferred relative risk estimate and the observed effect in the NARAC case-control study.We define Φobs = q(Robs-1)/[1 + q(Robs-1)], where Robs is the relative risk of disease associated with each copy of a measured allele of frequency q. The expression for Φ is similar to that for the population-attributable risk fraction (PARF) in epidemiological studies. However, in this genetic application, because each individual has two chromosomes, the PARF of a variant is Φ(2-Φ). In the Appendix we show that when the tagSNP is more common than the target variant, Φobs/D' is an unbiased estimator of Φtrue, where Φtrue is the equivalent parameter at the unmeasured target locus and D' is the conventional measure of LD between the measured tagSNP and the target variant in an undiseased population. We also show (see Appendix) that, for any given target variant and study design, the variance of Φobs for each tagSNP under the null hypothesis is inversely proportional to the LD measure r2, relating the measured tagSNP to the unmeasured target variant in the undiseased population.We calculated a weighted average of the values of Φinfer = Φobs/D' across all tagSNPs in the selected 600-kb region, and derived an inferred relative risk from this pooled estimate of Φ. In this paper we explore the effect of different assumptions about the generalizability of LD measures and selection of tagSNPs upon this point estimate. An empirical variance of this pooled estimate under the null hypothesis was derived from multiple random permutations of the B58C data set.","Individually linked HLA-DRB1 diplotypes and Illumina HumanHap550 genotypes were available for 1217 members of B58C and for 1187 controls and 799 cases from NARAC. The frequency of DRB1*04 was 21.1% in the B58C reference set, 16.5% in the NARAC controls and 52.2% in the NARAC cases. Counting chromosomes among cases and controls, the observed odds ratio of rheumatoid arthritis per copy of the DRB1*04 variant was 5.54 (95%CI 4.78-6.41) corresponding to a Φ of 0.4280.All subsequent data relates to 156 SNPs common to both data sets where the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the tag is greater than that of DRB1*04, also less than 44% in the reference data set and |D| > 0.01, where D is the covariance measure of LD. These restrictions are imposed to remove SNPs where the effect allele could be inconsistent between the B58C data and the NARAC controls data.For general application, the method needs to apply measures of LD derived from a reference data set to the observed data set where the target variant has not been measured. Figure 1 shows good correspondence for all measures of LD between B58C and NARAC controls. Our inference method assumes that the s measure of LD (see Appendix for definition) is constant between cases and controls. In this example, even where there is a strong association between the target variant and disease, this assumption appears valid, as shown in Figure 2. In most situations, the association of the target variant with tagSNPs in the observed case-control data would be unknown and estimated from the reference data set (e.g., B58C). Using D' and r2 from the B58C data, the pooled estimate of Φ is 0.4530, which is very close to the value of 0.4280 derived directly in the NARAC case-control data.Figure 1LD measures in NARAC controls versus B58C. Clockwise from top left: a) r2, b) D', c) s, and d) t. See Appendix for description of s and t.Full size imageFigure 2LD measures in NARAC controls versus case. Clockwise from top left: a) r2, b) D', c) s, and d) t. See Appendix for description of s and t.Full size imageThe variance of the pooled estimate of Φ is greater than the sum of the weights, because many of the neighboring tagSNPs are intercorrelated. The precision of this pooled estimate was estimated by performing 1000 random permutations of the B58C data set to derive the variance of the pooled estimate under the null hypothesis. These results are summarized in Table 1. Inclusion of all 156 SNPs generated a pooled estimate of similar magnitude and precision to that from the three most closely associated SNPs. On the other hand, if no closely associated tagSNPs had been available, results with similar magnitude and only slight loss of precision could be obtained from the majority of SNPs with r2 < 0.3. Indeed, in this example, from a region of high LD (D' > 0.5), useful information could be derived even from tagSNPs with r2 < 0.1.Table 1 Effect of different choices of tagSNP inclusion criteria on estimation of ΦFull size table","Comparing B58C to the NARAC controls, there was close correspondence in LD patterns. Within the NARAC data, however, the LD measures r2 and t in the region of interest were markedly different in cases and controls, reflecting the strong association between the target variant (DRB1*04) and rheumatoid arthritis. When compared with imputation approaches, the inference method has the advantage of working only with the LD pattern among controls, although it does assume generalizability of the sensitivity parameter s from controls to cases. This latter assumption was supported in the NARAC data. The inference approach that we describe can, with modification, be applied to continuous outcomes and offers an alternative to imputation methods that will be particularly attractive for target variants that are not part of standard panels such as HapMap, and for exploring further genome-wide sets of association measures that have been derived from meta-analysis of a particular disease or quantitative trait."
2,Association of genetic polymorphisms related to Johne’s disease with estimated breeding values of Holstein sires for milk ELISA test scores,"Johne’s disease (JD), also known as paratuberculosis, manifests as chronic enteritis in cattle and is caused by infection with the Gram-positive bacteria Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). With its worldwide prevalence, the disease is responsible for significant economic losses to the dairy industry [1]. Albeit controversial and debatable, JD etiological agent MAP is also viewed as a pathogen with zoonotic effects. Report of isolation of MAP from intestines of human patients suffering from Crohn’s disease has raised public health concerns [2]. Factors like non-availability of an efficacious vaccine to combat MAP infection, issues associated with currently available JD diagnostic assays such as long turnaround time associated with MAP culture tests, low sensitivity of ELISA tests during early stages of JD, and absence of efficient treatment options have limited JD control around the world [3]. Heritability estimates using different phenotypes of JD have been reported and are found to range from 0.06 to 0.27 [4,5,6,7] suggesting that there is enough genetic variation to enable selection for reduced susceptibility to MAP infection [8]. Given the low-to-moderate heritability estimates of JD resistance, the difficulty to collect accurate phenotypes on a large number of animals, and the fact that that animals are tested for MAP infection at a later life stage (i.e., do not have own record at selection stage), the use of genomic information is a promising way to make genetic progress for JD resistance.Genome-wide association (GWAS) and candidate gene studies concerning JD have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the bovine genome which are significantly associated with JD status in dairy cattle [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. The identification of JD associated SNPs and the heritable nature of MAP infection reflect the genetic variation in susceptibility and resistance to JD. These identified SNPs could be used in JD resistance breeding programs based on marker-enhanced selection (MES) once they are included in genotyping platforms. However, before this can occur there is a need to validate them, especially using independent cattle populations.In a recent study by Brito et al. [18], the authors reported genetic parameters such as heritability for MAP-specific antibody response and estimated breeding values (EBVs) for Holstein cattle based on milk ELISA test records along with their correlation with other economically important trait like milk yield; and other routinely evaluated traits such as somatic cell score (SCS); reproduction traits (calving to first service, 56-d non-return rate, Number of services, cows, First service to conception, cows, Days open; longevity trait (Direct herd life); and confirmation traits (Overall feet and legs, Overall conformation). Milk ELISA is a JD diagnostic method that detects MAP-specific antibodies in animals exposed to MAP and is therefore an indirect indicator of MAP infection status in cattle [19]. Unlike direct diagnostic tests based on MAP culture tests, MAP ELISA test have a quick turnaround time and can be easily used at the herd level. As studies concerning validation of JD SNPs are lacking, sires with highly accurate EBVs for milk ELISA testing can be used to validate previously identified JD SNPs. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to validate some of the previously associated JD SNPs in literature by testing their association with sire EBVs for milk ELISA test score.","A total of 141 SNPs passed the quality control test for MAF threshold and were included in the association analyses. After the General Quasi Likelihood Scoring (GQLS) association analysis, the SNPs rs41810662 (P-value = 0.00011), rs41617133 (P-value = 4.5E-06) and rs110225854 (P-value = 6.4E-19) were found to be significantly associated with Holstein sire EBVs for milk ELISA test scores at a FDR of 1%, and no other SNPs were found to be significant at a FDR of 5%. Table 1 lists the significant SNPs based on GQLS analysis. The Manhattan plot of GQLS analysis is shown in Fig. 1. A total of four SNPs were found to be significantly associated with sire EBVs by single-SNP regression analysis. This included the SNPs rs41810662 (P-value = 0.00062) and rs41617133 (P-value = 0.00050) that were also identified in the GQLS analysis; and two other SNPs, rs110494981 (P-value = 9.0E-05) and rs136182707 (P-value = 0.00088), which are located on BTA9 and BTA16, respectively. Table 2 lists all the significant SNPs along with their estimated SNP effect based on single-SNP regression analysis. The Manhattan plot of single SNP regression analysis is shown in Fig. 2.

Annual production losses due to JD on US dairy industry alone is estimated to be to $200–$250 millions dollars [1]. The losses associated with JD are mainly due to reduction in milk production, premature culling of JD positive animals, the management costs associated with JD control programs to limit MAP spread within and across the herds [21]. The role of host genetics in influencing JD infection status in cattle has been extensively studied, which resulted in the identification of several impactful genetic markers across the cattle genome [18]. However, studies concerning validation of genetic markers are still lacking. In this study, we validated some SNPs previously associated with JD by testing their association with breeding values estimated for JD milk ELISA test scores. A total of 498 bulls were classified into high (n = 248) and low (n = 250) groups based on their EBVs for milk ELISA test scores. Both groups were then genotyped using a customized SNP panel comprising 155 of the most prominent JD SNPs reported in the literature, including SNP from studies that used phenotypes other than milk ELISA test to define the case-control populations. Two association analyses were used to carry out SNP validation: a) General Quasi Likelihood Scoring (GQLS) analysis based on logistic regression, and, b) single-SNP regression.Three SNPs rs41810662, rs41617133 and rs110225854 were found to be significantly associated with Holstein sire EBVs using GQLS analysis at 1% FDR. The association of these three SNPs with sire EBVs in the current study confirmed their association with JD. The SNP rs41810662 is located on BTA16 and was previously found to be associated with MAP antibody response in Holstein cows [22]. The other two SNPs (rs41617133 and rs110225854) are located on BTA23 and BTA26, respectively, and were previously reported to be associated with JD susceptibility in Holsteins [14]. These last two SNPs were selected from a GWAS study that used fecal culture along with blood ELISA to define MAP infection status. This may be indicative of the shared genomic region in Holstein cattle that influences both JD fecal culture and ELISA positivity and a stronger evidence of these SNPs’ role towards resistance to MAP infection.A total of four SNPs were found to be significantly associated with sire EBVs by single-SNP regression analysis at 5% FDR. This included the SNPs rs41810662 and rs41617133 that were also identified in the GQLS analysis; and two other SNPs, rs110494981 and rs136182707, which are located on BTA9 and BTA16, respectively. The SNP rs110494981 was previously found to be associated with serum ELISA positivity for MAP antibodies in Italian Holsteins [13], whereas rs136182707 was previously identified by Mallikarjunappa et al. [22] and was found to be associated with MAP antibody ELISA positivity.One main result from this study is that most of the SNPs (137 out of 141) were not found to be significant in the population under study. This is not uncommon and may have multiple causes. While several GWAS studies have enabled identification of many SNPs associated with MAP infection status in cattle, there seems to be little congruence among them, which confirms the complex polygenic nature of the disease [8, 18]. Among other factors, the choice of phenotype (e.g., milk or blood ELISA, fecal MAP culture, tissue MAP culture) used to define infection status in case-control studies is shown to impact results [23]. Each test differs in their specificity and sensitivity in accurately diagnosing MAP infection and results are often dictated by the stage of disease progression in the tested animal [24]. As a result, precise phenotyping of infected versus non-infected animals remains a challenge.Milk ELISA is an indirect test for diagnosing MAP infection status that is based on identification of MAP-specific antibodies in MAP exposed animals. Unlike MAP culture techniques that take weeks to diagnose MAP infection, ELISA tests are more feasible at the herd level because of their rapid turn-around time and measurement cost. The objective of this study was to validate the previously reported JD SNPs reported in the literature. For this, we utilized sire EBVs estimated for milk ELISA test score to validate JD SNPs and confirm their association. As the sire EBVs used here were estimated using a large dataset of milk ELISA records, testing the association of JD SNPs with sire EBVs allows their validation at a large population level, while reducing the costs associated with genotyping large number of daughters. Genome-wide studies using EBVs to estimate SNP effects have been previously reported [25]. We adapted selective genotyping approach in our study where sires with EBVs estimated for milk ELISA results were classified into high and low groups and were subsequently genotyped. This approach of genotyping animals with extreme phenotypes reduces the need to genotype large number of animals and also increases power in determining the association of variants/SNPs in customized genotyping study like ours [26, 27].Only few SNPs were validated while using EBVs estimated for milk ELISA test results. The specificity of milk ELISA test is high (99%); however, it lacks sensitivity during early stages of MAP infection [28]. This could perhaps have influenced the results of this study. Kirkpatrick et al. [8] reported that combining fecal culture and ELISA tests is more suitable in defining MAP infection status. Future studies could aim at determining EBVs for both tests combined to validate other JD SNPs. Two SNPs (rs41810662 and rs136182707) that were validated in this study were previously reported in a GWAS we conducted with Canadian Holstein cows for which no pedigree information was available [22]. Since no pedigree information was available for these Canadian Holsteins cows, their relatedness with the Canadian sires used in the current study could not be explained.To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that considered validation of SNPs associated with JD reported in the literature using sire EBVs for milk ELISA test score. A follow-up study will consider search for gene variants in the same chromosomal areas as the identified SNP, which could play a role in JD resistance. One of the limitations associated with the current study is that validation was limited to a relatively small number of selected JD SNPs from GWAS and candidate gene studies from the literature. Future studies could consider validation of a larger number of reported JD SNPs using different (and ideally independent) dairy cattle populations.The problems related with JD control, and the economic and welfare implications of the disease on the dairy industry, warrant extensive exploration of genetic selection as an alternative option to control JD. This begins with the validation of associated genetic markers. Validation of some of the SNPs in this study is a step in this direction and has prompted future consideration of similar validation studies using different phenotypes. It is a critical step before genetic marker-based selection can be implemented to breed for JD resistance in cattle.","Using sire EBVs estimated for milk ELISA test scores, a total of four previously reported JD related SNPs were validated in this study which can be used to optimize genomic selection schemes. Future studies will consider exploring the genomic regions surrounding the validated SNPs for the presence of any candidate genes and genetic variants with relevance to JD."
