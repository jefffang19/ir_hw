0,Association of HLA DRB variants to genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis,"Genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis related to the presence of specific polymorphic HLA sequences has been frequently reported [1, 2]. HLA class II is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DRA) and a beta (DRB) chain. Within the DR molecule the beta chain contains all the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities. Association studies have provided evidence that a sequence of amino acids, termed the shared epitope, are involved in the disease process [3].",In order to understand the influence of variation in HLA DRB genes on rheumatoid arthritis sequence comparison of 21 allelic variants of HLA DRB gene was carried out.,"Although a lot of variation was observed in the 5’ ends, almost all sequences showed alignment scores of above 200 for 30-40% of the sequence towards the 3’ end. High levels of variations were however observed in two alleles; HLA-DRB1- 1318 and HLA-B*5904. Both these alleles have been recently reported as novel variants of HLA [4, 5].","Our results strongly support the shared epitope hypothesis presenting an explanation for the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. Yet considering the length of similar sequence at the 3’ end and the hyper variable region at the 5’ end, we conclude the hypothesis may not completely explain the course of disease severity and emphasize the need to develop superior biomarkers to predict the course of the disease."
1,Mapping a shared genetic basis for neurodevelopmental disorders,"Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, are characterized by strong clinical comorbidity, which suggests a common genetic etiology across the diverse group of disorders. Recent studies have found that inheritance of one neurodevelopmental disorder also confers an increased risk for other disorders within the same family. For example, monozygotic twins were found to have a higher propensity to develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or a learning disability if their co-twin had autism [1], whereas individuals whose relatives had schizophrenia were more likely to develop bipolar disorder, depression, and autism compared to the general population [2]. Therefore, it is increasingly clear that the genetic underpinnings for these disorders conform to neither the nosological “models” nor the diagnostic criteria for disease classification according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [1]. Major sources for the shared heritability of these disorders include single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), with rare recurrent CNVs having an especially large effect size for neurodevelopmental disorders. Many rare CNVs and SNVs have been implicated in different neurodevelopmental disorders, but examination of multiple disease cohorts in a single study allows for a more robust identification of the shared genetic basis of these disorders.","Given the large contribution of CNVs towards neurodevelopmental disorders, a study of rare CNVs in multiple disease cohorts would be a natural starting place to identify genes shared among the disorders. In this issue of Genome Medicine, Hakonarson and colleagues [3] examined CNVs present in 7849 patients from five neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disease cohorts, which included schizophrenia, bipolar disease, autism, ADHD, and depression, in the first large scale meta-analysis of CNVs across these diseases. Given that the genetic basis of depression and bipolar disorder have been elusive, the inclusion of cohorts of individuals with these two disorders is especially informative. The authors processed microarray data from the five cohorts and performed a gene-by-gene assessment for enrichment of CNVs in each cohort. Using this gene-based analysis, the authors identified two loci, ZNF280A and DOCK8, which were significantly enriched in affected individuals for at least two of the disease cohorts. Deletions in the zinc-finger protein ZNF280A were enriched in the ADHD and autism cohorts, whereas duplications that encompassed DOCK8 and the adjacent gene KANK1 were enriched in all five cohorts, which represents the first novel shared locus on chromosome 9p24.3 for these disorders. Neither DOCK8 nor KANK1 have been previously identified as candidate disease loci, but these genes have roles in intracellular signaling and neural growth/migration, respectively, that indicate a possible role for these genes in neurodevelopment. As this is the first study to identify 9p24.3 as a candidate disease locus, follow-up studies and functional experiments are important steps to delineate the roles of DOCK8 and KANK1 in specific disorders.Identification of the same rare CNV across several disorders should come as no surprise, as several rare CNVs are already implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (Fig. 1a). For example, the 15q11.2 deletion has been identified in individuals with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and ADHD, whereas the 16p11.2 deletion is a strong risk candidate for autism and also contributes to intellectual disability, epilepsy, and obesity at varying degrees of penetrance [4,5,6,7]. Mutations and structural variations that affect individual genes also appear to contribute towards multiple disorders (Fig. 1b). DISC1 is a classic example of genetic pleiotropy, in which balanced translocations of the gene are associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in multiple members of a large family [8]. In these instances, the varied clinical outcomes associated with the same causal variant are likely to be determined by disease-specific modifier variants in the genetic background.Fig. 1Shared genetic etiology in neurodevelopmental disorders. a Venn diagram showing associations for 16 rare pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) identified in disease cohorts for four neurodevelopmental disorders: intellectual disability/developmental delay (ID/DD) [4], autism [5], schizophrenia [6], and epilepsy [7]. Odds ratios for each disorder were calculated for each CNV based on the study data, with an odds ratio > 2 used to assign a CNV to a particular neurodevelopmental disorder. The grey scale bars next to the highlighted CNVs represent odds ratios (in order from left to right) for intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. b Venn diagram showing associations for 242 genes with at least one identified de novo loss-of-function variant or single-gene deletion found in neurodevelopmental disease cohorts [10]. c A model for the contributions of genetic variants with different effect sizes towards various neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants with larger effect sizes are likely to be primary causal variants, while variants with smaller effect sizes indicate modifiers that modulate the phenotype in concert with other variantsFull size image
","The novel duplication at 9p24.3 identified by Hakonarson and colleagues [3] could be a causative variant, but it is also possible that the duplication is a modifier for multiple neurodevelopmental outcomes (Fig. 1c). Modifier variants can be present in unaffected individuals but frequently co-occur with other known variants in affected individuals. These variants are usually just below the threshold for causation and have a lower effect size compared to causative variants. For example, deletions in LRRC4C were found to co-occur with other known pathogenic CNVs in individuals with autism, even though the variant by itself was not causal for the disease [9]. Combinations of variants of moderate or low effect size might be responsible for psychiatric phenotypes without known causative variants, such as bipolar disorder or depression, but variants of high effect size and potential causal nature are more likely to be associated with overt developmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. As the 9p24.3 duplication is enriched in individuals with both classes of neurodevelopmental disorders, the duplication could represent a novel modifier variant that interacts with causative variants in autism and schizophrenia and other low-effect variants in bipolar disorder and depression. Large-scale genomic studies such as that described by Hakonarson and colleagues [3], along with high-resolution phenotyping that evaluates multiple features of neurodevelopment, would be necessary to accurately determine whether a variant causes or modifies disease in specific contexts.","The meta-analysis of five disorders presented by Hakonarson and colleagues [3] identified a novel causative or modifier locus associated with multiple disorders. Recognizing the pleiotropic effects of variants such as the 9p24.3 deletion, it is clear that there is a larger degree of shared heritability among neurodevelopmental diseases than that suggested by their diverse clinical features. Identification of shared genes would be useful to uncover common molecular pathways for these distinct disorders. Discovery of shared genes and pathways will enable researchers to more accurately diagnose individuals with multiple disorders, assess the risk of developing co-morbid features, and ultimately design therapeutic targets that can be used to treat multiple disorders in these individuals."
2,Genetic aspects of Sjögren's syndrome,"Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune exocrinopathy of unknown aetiology. It is a member of the group of inflammatory rheumatic disorders classified as connective tissue diseases. Clinical experience indicates not only an overlap among these disorders but also a close relationship of, for example, autoantibody profiles [1]. The genetic implications of this overlap has not been extensively explored, and the genetics behind Sjögren's syndrome per se are not well characterized.There is no single disease-specific diagnostic criterion for Sjögren's syndrome. For diagnosis, the most functional criteria are the recently modified European classification criteria, which include a list of exclusions [2]. In addition to the subjective symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, the following objective signs should be present: ocular signs by Schirmer's I test and/or Rose Bengal score; focal sialadenitis by histopathology; salivary gland involvement by either salivary scintigraphy, parotid sialography or unstimulated salivary flow; and autoantibodies of Ro/ Sjögren syndrome antigen A (SSA) and/or La/Sjögren syndrome antigen B (SSB) specificity.Sjögren's syndrome occurs worldwide and in all ages. However, the peak incidence is in the fourth and fifth decades of life, with a female:male ratio of 9:1. A number of studies have shown great variation in the frequency of Sjögren's syndrome (for review [3]). Prevalence studies have demonstrated that sicca symptoms and primary Sjögren's syndrome affects a considerable percentage of the population, with precise numbers dependent on the age group studied and on the criteria used [4]. A cautious but realistic estimate from the studies presented thus far is that primary Sjögren's syndrome is a disease with a prevalence not exceeding 0.6% of the general population (6/1000).Although generally considered a T-cell-mediated disease, potential mechanisms underlying Sjögren's syndrome range from disturbances in apoptosis [5, 6] to circulating autoantibodies against the ribonucleoproteins Ro and La [7, 8] or cholinergic muscarinic receptors [9–11] in salivary and lacrimal glands in genetically predisposed individuals. Others relate reduced salivary and tear flow to aberrant glandular aquaporin-5 water channel proteins [12–14], although this is not unambiguous [15]. Possibly of greater importance is the recently described selective downregulation of aquaporin-1 expression in myoepithelial cells in salivary glands in primary Sjögren's syndrome [16].","A genetic predisposition to Sjögren's syndrome appears to exist, and several families involving two or more cases of Sjögren's syndrome have been described [17–23]. However, the level of genetic contribution is not known. Because large twin studies in Sjögren's syndrome are lacking, the twin concordance rate cannot be estimated. Only a few case reports describing twins with primary Sjögren's syndrome are available [24–27]. Twins exhibited a very similar phenotype with almost identical clinical presentation, including dry eyes and dry mouth; similar serological data (IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB, rheumatoid factor), with identical fine specificity in their immune responses to 60kDa Ro/SSA; and identical labial salivary gland focus scores [24, 27].Familial clustering of different autoimmune diseases and co-association of multiple autoimmune diseases in individuals have frequently been reported [28]. Interestingly, it is common for a Sjögren's syndrome proband to have relatives with other autoimmune diseases (approximately 30–35%) [17, 29, 30]. Furthermore, Sjögren's syndrome exists in two forms – primary and secondary; the form that is present depends on whether it occurs alone or together with other connective diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis [31]. Clustering of non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility candidate loci in human autoimmune diseases supports a hypothesis that, in some cases, clinically distinct autoimmune diseases may be controlled by a common set of susceptibility genes [32].Sjögren's syndrome is considered a complex disorder. Susceptibility to the disease can be ascribed to an interplay between genetic factors and the environment. In complex diseases, one specific gene is neither necessary nor sufficient for disease expression. This makes the genetics behind these diseases more complicated than those of diseases with a simple Mendelian character.","The polymorphic MHC genes are the best documented genetic risk factors for the development of autoimmune diseases overall [33–35]. With regard to Sjögren's syndrome, the most relevant MHC complex genes are the class II genes, specifically the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and HLA-DQ alleles [36]. Patients of different ethnic origins exhibit different HLA gene associations [37]. In Caucasians of northern and western European backgrounds, including North American Caucasians, Sjögren's syndrome is among several autoimmune diseases that are associated with the haplotypes B8, DRw52 and DR3. The increased frequency of HLA-B8 was presumably due to an association with the HLA class II allele HLA-DRB1*03. However, a novel association of HLA class I alleles (i.e. HLA-A24) to susceptibility to primary Sjögren's syndrome was recently reported [38]. Beyond that, an association with DR2 has been found in Scandinavians [39] and with DR5 in Greeks [40]. All of the haplotypes are in strong linkage disequilibrium, resulting in certain difficulties in establishing which of the genes contains the locus that confers the risk. DQCAR is a very polymorphic CA repeat microsatellite located between the HLA DQA1 and DQB1 gene and specific DQCAR alleles have been found to be in tight linkage disequilibrium with known HLA DR-DQ haplotypes. HLA-DQB1 CAR1/CAR2 allele frequencies were found to be significantly different in patients with Sjögren's syndrome as compared with healthy control individuals in a study in which the Kaplan criteria were used to classify Sjögren's syndrome [41].Apparently, the HLA haplotype may influence the severity of autoimmune disease. It has been claimed that Sjögren's syndrome patients with DQ1/DQ2 alleles have a more severe autoimmune disease than do patients with any other allelic combination at HLA-DQ [42], and the DR3-DQ2 haplotype has been indicated as a possible marker for a more active immune response in Finnish patients with Sjögren's disease [43].","Distinct HLA haplotypes have been associated with certain degrees of autoantibody diversification in Sjögren's syndrome [44]. Autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB have been found to be associated with DR3, DQA and DQB alleles [45–47]. A dose-dependent contribution of DQα-34Q and DQβ-26L, in addition to the DRB1*03-DQB1*02-DQA1*0501 haplotype encompassing the transethnically associated DQβ-DI motif, represented the strongest contributors to the formation of an anti-Ro/La response in Norwegian patients with Sjögren's syndrome [45]. A stronger correlation has been found between anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies and DR3/DR2 than that with the disease itself [45, 48–50]. In Japanese persons, HLA class II allele association has been reported to differ among anti-Ro/SSA-positive individuals according to the presence or absence of coexisting anti-La/SSB [51]."
3,From DNA to RNA to disease and back: The 'central dogma' of regulatory disease variation,"Understanding the causes of human disease is one of the most fundamental goals of modern medicine. Individuals differ with respect to disease susceptibility, disease progression and effectiveness of treatment. Identifying the factors contributing to these differences, and elucidating their interactions as they contribute to aspects of disease phenotype, is a precursor to improved prevention, detection and treatment of disease.Much of the understanding of human disease derives from the study of those diseases that segregate in families in a Mendelian fashion, where the causative variants and the genes in which they reside have been identified through classical family linkage approaches [1] and through studies in large pedigrees and in isolated populations based on founder effects [2]. The vast majority of common diseases exhibit a more complex mode of inheritance, however, aggregating in families but rarely exhibiting Mendelian inheritance. Examples of diseases of this type include diabetes, obesity, schizophrenia and asthma. Understanding of these 'complex' diseases is improving, although still limited, but it is clear that genetic variation plays an important role in susceptibility to disease, for example in autoimmune and infectious diseases [3]. Most complex disease is thought to be caused by the combined effect of genetic variants at a few loci or multiple loci, each with only modest functional effects on susceptibility. Additional roles are played by environmental factors and their interactions. Mapping the genomic regions contributing to disease creates new directions for disease research and is an important step towards improving human health.Approaches to identifying the genes involved in complex disease can be generally grouped into two categories: candidate gene studies and linkage/association studies. Candidate gene studies use knowledge about the biology of a disease, and about genes in physiologically or biochemically relevant pathways, and attempt to correlate genetic variation at these 'candidate genes' with disease phenotype. Unfortunately, for most diseases, this type of information is not available or complete enough to prove widely useful, and including them in some of the analyses is more likely to increase the noise than it is to reduce the search space for the disease. Genome-wide linkage studies and association analyses serve as alternative approaches to surveying the contribution to disease of genetic variants located anywhere in the genome. The genome-wide aspect means that these studies do not require any a priori hypothesis that a particular region is involved, although predictions about the potential effect of specific variants (eg non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) can be incorporated in the models. In this respect, these approaches are unbiased. Family-based linkage studies entail identifying genetic variants in families that co-segregate with disease more often than would be expected by chance. In general, linkage studies have achieved limited success in identifying genomic regions involved in complex disease, in part because they are underpowered to detect moderate genetic effects. Furthermore, because identification of a region or regions associated with the disease or trait requires identifying those alleles that segregate with the disease in families, which in turn depends on recombination within the families, it can be difficult to narrow a region exhibiting significant linkage. An alternative methodology is to perform association analysis, which looks for correlation of genetic variants with aspects of phenotype, but does not require a pedigree structure for the individuals. Association analyses are more powerful for the detection of common disease alleles with small to modest effects [4, 5], and increasingly are being used successfully in studies to identify genes contributing to disease [6, 7].Although many phenotypic differences among individuals are attributable to variants in coding DNA [8], variants in noncoding DNA can have profound effects on phenotypes, including disease phenotypes. For example, regulatory variants affecting transcription initiation, splicing, RNA stability and translational efficiency are known to play roles in conditions including autoimmune disease (CTLA4[9]), malaria (DARC[10]), various cancers (SMYD3[11]) and other examples (shown in Table 1). In studies of such diseases, gene expression may serve as an intermediate phenotype between disease phenotype and genotype [30, 31]. Gene expression, or mRNA levels, can be modulated by variants in coding or non-coding DNA (eg transcription factors or binding sites within promoters). Whole-genome association studies of gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] mapping) may generate hypotheses for disease susceptibility by identifying those regions of the genome with functional effects on gene expression. These might then serve as candidate regions for evaluating for association with disease phenotypes, as is discussed below.Table 1 Genes with non-coding variants affecting diseaseFull size table","An efficient approach to the study of human disease benefits from the use of shared resources. For example, in order to perform genome-wide linkage or association analyses, suitable DNA markers are required. The human genome is estimated to harbour more than 10 million SNPs, present at > 1 per cent frequency [32], and these SNPs are located throughout the genome in regions of coding and non-coding DNA. Publicly available databases of SNP alleles, assays and genotypes are accessible online (eg dbSNP [33] and HapMap [34]). High-throughput genotyping platforms and reductions in genotyping costs now make whole-genome genotyping feasible for large numbers of samples. Gene expression can also be quantified in a high-throughput manner using commercially available microarrays, permitting the detection of small differences in expression levels among samples.The establishment of cell lines creates resources that can be used by multiple research groups from around the world to survey various cellular phenotypes. With respect to the study of gene expression, it is desirable to establish cell lines from different tissues because gene expression is highly dependent on developmental and cellular context and, indeed, some diseases manifest their phenotypes only in specific tissues. In addition, the cell perturbations that accompany the establishment of cell lines suggest the study of gene expression in primary tissues, although, clearly, the choice of sample depends on the purpose, stage and feasibility of a study, the sample size required and its availability. Despite some shortcomings of cell lines as perfect proxies for the complete set of human tissues, data can be collected on a large scale with respect to sample size and reproducibility and can provide candidates for further study in other samples. Currently, there are relatively few data on gene expression across the diversity of healthy human tissues or across multiple individuals from different populations. These data from healthy individuals will provide important information on the range of naturally occurring gene expression variation and will serve as a baseline against which to compare disease-associated molecular phenotypes.","Although genome-wide association studies are thought to have more power than family-based linkage studies, they present strong challenges in the form of statistical interpretation. For example, a simple genome-wide association study may test hundreds of thousands of SNPs for association to a phenotype (or, more typically, multiple phenotypes), and more complicated models allowing for SNP - SNP interactions vastly increase the already large number of statistical tests. With such a large number of tests, the significance threshold must be adjusted to control for the number of false-positive associations. Although procedures for multiple test correction exist -- for example, Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate [35, 36] and permutations of phenotypes relative to genotypes [37] -- it remains unclear which is the best method to apply in this context. It is also not trivial to infer the biological significance of an association from statistical significance, because allele frequencies, variance of the phenotype, density of markers and linkage disequilibrium (LD) can have a tremendous impact on the statistical significance inferred.Human genetic variation is structured into haplotypes, such that alleles at nearby loci often show strong statistical association with one another. Because of this association, known as LD, a large region may contain multiple SNPs exhibiting a significant association with a given phenotype. Although this structure of human genetic variation facilitates association mapping, it can complicate subsequent fine-scale mapping to narrow the associated region and locate the causal variant, as discussed below. Another concern in association studies is the potential for false associations caused by population stratification [38], so care must be taken to reduce these effects through appropriate experimental design and data analysis [39, 40].","The interrogation of gene expression to facilitate the design and interpretation of disease association studies can be a powerful tool for the identification of biologically functional variants and the interpretation of biological effects [41]. By introducing a quantifiable and easily measurable biological outcome, it is possible to assess the relevance of statistical significance and eliminate some of the issues raised above. The use of gene expression variation in the context of disease mapping can be viewed in two ways (Figure 1). On the one hand, hypotheses can be generated by discovering functional variation using eQTL mapping and subsequently testing those functional variants in large case-control samples. On the other hand, following a disease association study that has identified several signals located within regions of non-coding DNA, eQTL mapping can be used to interpret and dissect the functional effect of the candidate disease variants. Below, the two directions will be explored in more detail.Figure 1Flow charts demonstrating the use of genome-wide gene expression studies in relation to disease studies. (A) Generating hypotheses for disease studies. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies identify variable regions of the genome with functional effects on gene expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within these functional regions can be candidates for involvement in disease. (B) Supporting disease association studies. Disease mapping studies often identify non-coding regions of the genome exhibiting significant association with disease. eQTL studies can provide a link to an associated gene by providing annotation of the function of that non-coding region.Full size imageGenerating functional candidates using eQTL mappingRegions with functional effects on gene expression can be localised through the use of association mapping. Gene expression, or mRNA level, is a quantitative phenotype that can be assayed in multiple individuals. When the same individuals are surveyed for genetic variation at marker loci, for example SNPs, association analysis tests whether variation at each SNP can explain the observed phenotypic variation. The rationale behind this analysis is that markers themselves are either the causal variant or are highly correlated (in LD) with the causal variant.Association mapping of gene expression variation has been successful in many species, including human [42–45], yeast [46–48], mouse [49–52], rat [53], fish [54, 55] and maize [52]. Together, these studies provide several striking observations related to the nature of functional variation influencing gene expression. First, variation in gene expression levels among individuals is common -- and much of that phenotypic variation has a genetic basis. Much of the association signal is located cis- to the gene of interest [45, 52, 56], although trans-acting variants have also been observed. Hotspots of gene regulation (ie regions of the genome influencing expression of several genes) have been observed in some [44], but not all, studies.There are several ways in which the study of the regulation of gene expression can enhance disease studies as well as narrow the choice of candidate regions for disease association studies. Where information exists about the contribution of particular genes to a disease phenotype or susceptibility, understanding the regulatory control of those genes may assist in elucidating the complete set of effects. In addition, understanding the regulation of categories of genes, or genes of a particular pathway, may provide targets for further follow-up in disease studies. It may prove more time-efficient and cost-effective to have a list of many potential functional variants located throughout the genome, however, and test them against a large number of diseases. Whole-genome eQTL studies can provide a list of regions of the genome with functional effects on the expression of known genes (Figure 1a). SNPs located within these regions can then serve as candidates for disease association studies, much in the same way that non-synonymous SNPs are often considered because of their potential functional effect. There are several advantages to this type of targeted approach over a whole-genome scan. First, because the number of SNPs to be genotyped in each individual is reduced, many more individuals can be surveyed in a disease study without vastly increasing costs. The reduction in the number of markers tested can eliminate some of the problems of multiple test correction, more sensible thresholds can be used and smaller effect variants can be detected. Secondly, any significant associations detected between SNP and disease phenotype provide both a mechanism (gene regulation) and the identity of the affected gene. Finally, the fact that potential causal regulatory variants were initially discovered in healthy individuals and subsequently have been associated with disease means that such variants are common and are likely to contribute significantly to the disease risk of the population.The methodology above carries the risk of focusing only on certain types of genomic variants, while it is known that much of genome function is still missing. A way to circumvent this problem is to enhance disease studies by incorporating the data on functional regulatory regions while using commercially available whole-genome SNP genotyping chips in disease studies, in order to perform the association analysis using Bayesian methods that assign different prior probabilities to SNPs on the array. Under such a scenario, SNPs located in regions with known functional effects on expression of specific genes -- as identified through eQTL studies -- would be assigned a higher prior probability of being associated with a phenotype. In addition, one might assign a higher prior probability to SNPs in known promoters, enhancers or transcription factors. Thus, one could focus on the effects of candidate variants without missing other important signals. Another substantial advance of knowing regulatory variants before performing a genome-wide association study is that one can correlate phenotypes and regulatory networks and utilise such information in the statistical modelling of the disease."
