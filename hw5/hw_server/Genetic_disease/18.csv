0,"Clinical, morphological and genetic features of a cohort of late onset GSD II patients: typical and atypical presentations","GSDII (Pompe disease) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease due to alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency that presents with infantile and late-onset forms. Herein, we describe a cohort of 29 late-onset patients (15 males and 14 females, aged 9 to 76), and discuss some unusual clinical features seen in 4 of them.","Clinical evaluations were performed in all patients using the Walton and Gardner-Medwin, MRC and GSGC scales, and the 6MWT. Respiratory function was assessed using FVC% in upright and supine positions. All patients underwent morphological and biochemical examinations, muscle MRI, neurophysiological studies, and molecular genetic analysis.","Out of 29 patients, 15 received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). 57% initially had limb-girdle involvement, 29% an isolated hyperCKemia, and 14% respiratory insufficiency. Neurophysiological studies revealed a myopathic pattern in 48% of patients, neurogenic or mixed in 28%, whereas 24% of patients did not show any electrical abnormality. In the examined patients, muscle MRI showed early involvement of ileopsoas, gluteus and posterior thigh muscles. Morphological studies revealed vacuolar myopathy in 68% of patients, and biochemical analysis showed residual alpha-glucosidase activity ranging from 0.01% to 25%. Molecular genetic analysis confirmed IVS13T>G as the most common mutation, but we also identified three novel point mutations. Atypical clinical features were observed in 4 out of 29 patients: a 66-year-old female with disease onset involving distal upper limbs muscles; a 70-year-old male with mesial temporal sclerosis without epileptic or cognitive disorders; a 46-year-old male with severe neurosensory hearing loss (with very early hearing difficulties); and a 51-year-old female with a congenital absence of a thyroid lobe.","Our study confirms the clinical, morphological and molecular genetic heterogeneity of late-onset GSDII. Muscle MRI is a very useful tool for muscle damage evaluation, especially at the early stages of the disease. Based on our experience with some atypical cases, we suggest always performing a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients in order to highlight unusual muscular (e.g. distal involvement) and/or CNS presentations. These cases reinforce the hypothesis that modifier genes and/or epigenetic factors may contribute to clinical presentations of Pompe disease."
1,“Too much guts and not enough brains”: (epi)genetic mechanisms and future therapies of Hirschsprung disease — a review,"Epigenetics and epitranscriptomics (i.e., modifications of macromolecules like DNA and RNA) are known to be of crucial importance in the development of a central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about the role of these mechanisms in the differentiation of neural crest derivatives and development of a functional enteric nervous system. In the following, we describe how modulation of epigenetic and epitranscriptomic pathways may open for novel treatment of human neurocristopathies by targeting these mechanisms.","Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital anomaly and the most common enteric neuropathy. It affects about 1.43/10,000 [1] and is characterized by lack of ganglion cells (aganglionosis) in a segment of the distal bowel. The aganglionic segment invariably involves the internal anal sphincter and extends proximally to affect a variable extent of the colon. The absence of enteric neurons leads to a tonic contraction of the affected segment, resulting in gastrointestinal obstruction. The condition is usually symptomatic in the neonatal period. The treatment of HSCR is surgical excision of the aganglionic bowel and a coloanal anastomosis. However, even with the best available therapy, there is significant long-term morbidity associated with the condition [2, 3]. Fecal incontinence and constipation are common [4].The genetic background of HSCR is complex. The majority of HSCR cases are sporadic (80%) while the rest are familial. Furthermore, there is a 4:1 predominance in males, with the estimated RET mutation penetrance of 72% in males and 51% in females [5]. The male to female ratio is significantly higher for short-segment HSCR disease in comparison with long-segment HSCR disease [5, 6]. Although most cases occur as an isolated trait (70%), 12% of patients have an associated chromosomal abnormality, and the majority of those have trisomy 21. In addition to trisomy 21, HSCR disease is associated with a wide range of congenital anomalies and syndromes such as distal limb, craniofacial, central nervous system, genital, kidney, and cardiac malformations; Mowat-Wilson; Goldberg-Shprintzen; Shah-Waardenburg; and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Syndromic HSCR shows a Mendelian inheritance, while non-syndromic HSCR displays a non-Mendelian inheritance with a low sex-dependent penetrance and variable expression [7]. This is supportive of the hypothesis of HSCR being a multigenic disorder, implicating that one or more genes with low penetrance are involved. In addition, mutations in more of the HSCR-associated genes are hypothesized to result in a more severe phenotype, i.e., a longer length of the intestine is affected.The ganglion cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) are entirely derived from the neural crest which is a transient, multipotent cell population originating from the neural tube [8, 9]. Neural crest cells originate at different axial levels (cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral) and migrate extensively throughout the embryo to colonize multiple organ primordia and differentiate into a variety of cell types and tissues [10]. The ENS is mainly derived from vagal neural crest cells, with a minor contribution from the sacral neural crest. Around the third week of human pregnancy, the vagal neural crest cells proliferate and invade the anterior foregut at which point they are referred to as enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs). During the following weeks, the ENCDCs migrate in a rostral to caudal direction eventually colonizing the entire length of the gut around week 7. Simultaneously, the migrating ENCDCs differentiate into defined enteric neurons and glia [11, 12]. The exact mechanisms orchestrating this journey of the vagal neural crest cells are not well characterized. However, it is known that signaling pathways, particularly the RET/GFRα1/GDNF and EDNRB/ECE1/EDN3 pathways, the transcription factors SOX10 and PHOX2B, and a number of morphogens such as netrin, sonic hedgehog, or semasphorins are of crucial importance [12,13,14,15,16] (Figs. 1 and 2).

Fig. 2ENS development. In mice, ENS development has been studied thoroughly. Vagal NCCs migrate in a rostral to caudal direction eventually colonizing the entire length of the gut. Vagal NCCs invade the anterior foregut and continue along the midgut and hindgut. On embryonic day 11.5, there is a small wave of NCCs that cross over from the foregut to the hindgut. There is also a minor contribution of anterior trunk NCCs to the foregut and of sacral NCCs to the hindgutFull size imageSeveral genes are associated with ENS development, thereby also in the pathogenesis of HSCR disease. RET is identified as the main HSCR gene as the RET mutation is found in 50% of familial and 15–20% of sporadic HSCR cases [5]. RET is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase which, upon binding of its ligand, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), activates a variety of downstream pathways. Extensive reviews summarize the genes that have been associated with HSCR, and new genes are added to this list constantly [5, 17,18,19,20,21]. Recently, four de novo mutations were identified by whole exome sequencing: DENND3, NCLN, NUP96, and TBATA [22]. Even if it seems likely that somatic mutations that occur during ENS development contribute to HSCR pathogenesis, the evidence so far is inconclusive. Hence, the exact contribution of ENS-specific genes and their interplay in the pathogenesis of HSCR remains elusive.","All nuclear cells of the human body contain the same sequence of DNA, the genome, yet they display very diverse cell-specific functions. To achieve differentially expressed genes without altering the genome sequence, nature has evolved an intricate system of epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation and histone modifications are most studied. These two epigenetic processes are partly linked and have critical roles for embryonic development and neurogenesis [23]. Various RNA molecules make up a third, and more heterogeneous group of epigenetic modifiers. Such RNA modifications are referred to as epitranscriptomics. Hence, epigenetics refers to functional alterations of the genome without a change in the nucleotide sequence, and epitranscriptomics refers specifically to functional alterations in the transcriptome without a change in the ribonucleotide sequence. Recently, the reversible nature of regulatory RNA modifications was discovered, and due to its recent discovery, this has not yet been extensively studied [24, 25]. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that such modifications play important roles in neurogenesis and embryonic development [26,27,28]. Here, we review the current knowledge of epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation in the development of the ENS and its potential significance for the pathogenesis of HSCR. We also discuss possible future therapies and how targeting of epigenetic and epitranscriptomic mechanisms may open new approaches for novel treatment.","DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA strand (Fig. 4). This addition is performed by methyltransferases (DNMTs) and recruits methyl-binding proteins, e.g., MeCP2. Hence, DNMTs and MeCP2 are essential for normal mammalian development as they regulate gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and genomic stability by determining the methylation degree of the genome [29, 30]. Hypermethylation silences genes, while hypomethylation increases transcription (Fig. 3). Some DNMTs establish the initial DNA methylation patterns (DNMT1), and others maintain DNA methylation over cell generations (DNMT2 and DNMT3). MeCP2 is necessary to bind methyl groups on the DNA strand. Hence, DNMTs and MeCP2 regulate ENS development through the DNA methylation of genes involved in neurogenesis. This suggests that an aberrant methylation pattern may lead to an unfavorable increase or decrease of gene expression, which may contribute to HSCR [31, 32].
Fig. 3a, b DNA methylation. In the promoter area of genes, hypomethylation of the CpG island increases gene expression, while hypermethylation of the CpG island reduces gene expression. Hence, DNA hypomethylation activates genes while hypermethylation silences themFull size imageBoth DNMT3B and MeCP2 expression are decreased in neural stem cells obtained from HSCR patients, which result in a decrease of global DNA methylation. This may contribute to an aberrant expression pattern of HSCR-associated genes [32, 33]. Target genes of DNMT3B have been identified, and their expression patterns analyzed and compared in HSCR patients versus controls. These target genes were upregulated in HSCR patients, which is consistent with the lower global DNA methylation due to downregulation of DNMT3B described in these patients [34]. Moreover, knockdown of DNMT3B in human embryonic stem cells leads to hypomethylation that consequently increases the expression of neural crest-specific genes (Pax3, Pax7, FoxD3, Snail2, and Sox10), and accelerates neural crest differentiation [35]. In addition, the expression of MeCP2 is lower in HSCR patients compared with controls [33]. This demonstrates that both DNMTs and MeCP2 contribute to HSCR pathogenesis by regulating gene expression [34].Several HSCR-associated genes are regulated by the methylation degree of their promoter areas. One of these genes is RET, and it has been suggested that the level of RET expression determines the length of the aganglionic segment [36]. The RET-promoter has a 5′CpG3′ rich region highly susceptible for methylation, and its methylation degree regulates RET expression. Epigenetic inactivation by promoter hypermethylation of RET has been demonstrated [32]. In addition, the expression of GDNF (the ligand of RET) is decreased in some HSCR patients due to a promoter area hypermethylation [37]. Interestingly, demethylation of GDNF promotes cell proliferation and viability, cell cycle progression, and cell invasion in studies in vitro of cells derived from HSCR tissues [37]. EDNRB, another important gene in HSCR pathogenesis, is overexpressed in some HSCR patients when compared with controls, and it has a hypomethylated promotor area [38]. Furthermore, an aberrant methylation pattern has been found in the promoter area of PHOX2B in patients with neuroblastoma tumors, tumors that originate from neural crest cells [32]. This finding supports the hypothesis that the methylation degree of PHOX2B may also play a role in the pathogenesis of neurocristopathies, such as HSCR. Thus, aberrant methylation patterns resulting in epigenetic inactivation or overactivation of HSCR-associated genes are implicated in the development of HSCR [32]."
