0,Large family with both parents affected by distinct BRCA1 mutations: implications for genetic testing,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations occur in approximately 0.2–1% healthy subjects, 5% non-selected breast cancer (BC) patients, 15% consecutive ovarian cancer (OC) cases, and 25% females with clinical features of hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome [1–8]. Given low populational frequency and high penetrance of deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, only one of the parent of the affected proband is usually suspected to contain this genetic lesion. Nevertheless, the probability of both parents being a carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is not negligible. If we consider random healthy couples, this estimate would be equal to 0.2–1% × 0.2–1% = 0.0004–0.01% (i.e., 1:250000 - 1:10000). This probability is significantly increased if we deal with already affected females. Indeed, the most conservative calculation would imply that the chance to detect a mutation in one of the parents of the patient is the same as in the patient herself, whereas the probability for the remaining parent to be affected by BRCA1 or BRCA2 defect is similar to the populational frequency of the latter. Therefore, approximately 0.01–0.05% (i.e., 1:10000 - 1:2000) of BC patients, 0.03 – 0.15% (i.e., 1:3333-1:667) of OC patients, and 0.05–0.25% (i.e., 1:2000 - 1:400) of women with HOBC have both parents carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Coincident occurrence of BRCA1 heterozygosity in mother and father is particularly likely if both parents of the patient report a strong family history of the breast-ovarian cancer disease, however these situations are exceptionally rare due to gender-specific penetrance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations and lack of explicit information in the most of pedigrees.Here we report an unique family with multiple affected members and 2 distinct BRCA1 mutations identified. Breast cancer patient III.9 was forwarded to a genetic counselor in the year 2002 because of pronounced family history (Fig. 1). She underwent DNA testing for Russian founder mutations [8], however no genetic lesion has been identified. DNA sequencing was not accessible to us at that time, however, given an unusually strong family history of breast-ovarian cancer and large number of yet healthy female relatives, we desperately attempted to find a facility who would agree to perform a full-length BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis for this particular patient. Unfortunately, this effort failed to succeed. The patient and her only sister who accepted the invitation for genetic counseling (III.5, healthy by then) were informed that their family is likely to suffer from hereditary cancer syndrome, and the failure to identify a causative mutation may be related to current technical limitations. Therefore, we recommended tight diagnostic monitoring for BC and OC, as well as consideration of comprehensive analysis of breast cancer genes as soon as it becomes available. In the year 2007, healthy female III.2 was forwarded to DNA testing by her mammologist because of cancer family history concerns. ""Founder"" test-panel [8] revealed the presence of BRCA1 5382insC mutation, therefore she was advised to consult with a cancer geneticist. Conversation with this women revealed that she belonged to the same family as the patient III.9, however she was unaware about genetic counseling applied to her sisters III.9 and III.5. Then, BRCA1 5382insC mutation testing was performed for her affected mother (II.6, BC at age 66), her sisters (III.4, healthy; III.5, affected by BC at age 52, i.e. after the initial counseling in the year 2002; III.6, BC at age 35), and her healthy 31-years-old nephew whose mother (III.11) survived BC at age 35 but died from OC at 50. All these relatives were found to carry BRCA1 5382insC mutation, with the exception of BC patient III.6. Since III.6 was already a second family member, who acquired cancer disease but was negative for founder mutation test, sequencing analysis was applied to DNA samples III.6 and III.9; it identified second BRCA1 mutation, 1629delC.Figure 1
Pedigree of the breast-ovarian cancer family with 2 BRCA1 mutations. Circles and squares indicate females and males, respectively. Crossed symbols are used for deceased subjects; age at death is given after the letter ""d"", otherwise current age is provided. Black circles correspond to females affected by breast or ovarian cancer; half-filled circles are used for yet healthy BRCA1 mutation carriers; gray symbols depict subjects with unknown or non-breast-ovarian tumors. BC – breast cancer; OC – ovarian cancer; age at cancer diagnosis is given in brackets. All tested subjects carried either BRCA1 5382insC or BRCA1 1629delC allele, i.e. missing information on the BRCA1 status indicates that DNA from this family member has not been analyzed. Index cases are designated by arrows (see the text).Full size image
Since 2 sisters from this family carry BRCA1 1629delC, it is highly unlikely that these mutations appeared de novo; instead, it is nearly certain that the father of these sisters (II.5) was a carrier of this allele. We could not validate this assumption, because this man died a long time ago. Similarly, patient III.11 was likely to carry BRCA1 5382insC mutation, but this could not be confirmed.Homozygosity for BRCA1 inactivation was reported previously in a single human [9], although this observation was later suggested to be a technical artifact [10]. We conducted testing for both BRCA1 5382insC and 1629delC alleles in all available DNA samples, and failed to detect any biallelic defect. Taken together with the only available publication on BRCA1 mutation occurring in both parents [11] and a large body of evidence for early embryonic lethality of BRCA1 knockout mice [12–14], our data provide additional support to the common statement on the lack of viability of BRCA1-null homozygotes. This contrasts to the situation with another breast-ovarian cancer gene, BRCA2, whose homozygous inactivation leads to Fanconi anemia but is not absolutely lethal [15].","While families harboring both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been repeatedly presented in the literature [16], there is no systematic analysis of the pedigrees with both parents carrying distinct alterations in the BRCA1 gene [11]. Our observation calls for the same caution as was formulated in a series of articles describing double mutations for BRCA1 and BRCA2 [16]. First, in the communities with strong founder effect, relaxed criteria for subjects selection should be used when considering the administration of appropriate non-expensive PCR tests; it is highly recommended that all BC and OC patients, and perhaps even healthy middle-aged females, have to be offered the opportunity of the DNA analysis [3, 6, 8, 16]. Secondly, the possibility of existence of disease phenocopies within the same family has to be always remembered; therefore, failure to identify breast-ovarian cancer gene mutation in the index case does not exclude the possibility of identification of BRCA defect in other affected members of a given pedigree. Ideally, all affected members of the family have to undergo DNA testing at least for the presence of founder mutations [16].",Written informed consent was obtained from the alive memebrs of the described family for the publication of this case report. Copies of the written consent are available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.,"Below are the links to the authors’ original submitted files for images.

1,Genome-based prediction of common diseases: methodological considerations for future research,"The past decade has seen rapid developments in our understanding of the genetic etiology of various common multifactorial diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Crohn's disease and various cancers [1]. Further developments in genomic research, such as the growing number of genome-wide association studies, the large-scale consortia that are pooling data from various studies, and the advances in statistical genomics and genotype technology, are drastically improving the chances of identifying common low risk variants and rare high risk variants. It is beyond doubt that many more genetic susceptibility variants will be discovered in the next few years.Expectations are high that increasing knowledge of the genetic bases of disease will eventually lead to personalized medicine, that is, to preventive and therapeutic interventions for complex diseases that are tailored to individuals on the basis of their genetic profiles [2, 3]. Genome-based personalized medicine already exists for monogenic disorders. For example, female carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are offered biannual mammography screening or provided the opportunity of preventive surgery. Potential applications of genetic profiling in multifactorial diseases include tailoring of prevention programs to at-risk individuals, determining the starting age of participation in screening programs [4] and, when profiles predict treatment success, tailoring treatment modalities and starting doses.As we have reviewed recently [5], the predictive value of genetic profiling is still limited at present, with a few promising exceptions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) gives an assessment of the discriminative accuracy of a prediction model, that is, the degree to which the test results can discriminate between persons who will develop the disease and those who will not. AUC ranges from 0.50 (equal to tossing a coin) to 1.00 (perfect prediction). We found that the AUC was low for the genetic prediction of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease and high for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia and AMD [5]. Table 1 illustrates that the high AUC of 0.80 for hypertriglyceridemia resulted from very strong individual genetic factors, with odds ratios ranging from 2.0 to 7.4, and the low AUC of 0.55 for coronary heart disease from genetic variants with low odds ratios. Note that the strongest genetic predictor by far for coronary heart disease had a weaker effect than the weakest predictor for hypertriglyceridemia. In order to achieve appreciable predictive value, genetic profiles need to include a few strong genetic risk factors or a large number of weak susceptibility variants [6].Table 1 AUC and effect estimates of susceptibility variants for the prediction of three diseasesFull size tableAlthough the predictive value of genetic profiling is still limited, an increasing number of companies already offer personalized lifestyle health recommendations and nutritional supplements on the basis of clients' genetic profiles [7]. Despite the limited predictive value of genetic testing in multifactorial diseases, these commercial developments will yield ongoing interest from consumers, from health care professionals confronted with questions from patients who underwent testing, and from policy makers who search for novel strategies to improve health care and population health. These developments ask for a solid evidence base for genomics applications. One of the major challenges for the coming decades will be to investigate the translation of this emerging genomic knowledge into public health and medical care [8, 9].In this article, we review recent studies on the predictive value of genetic profiling from a methodological perspective. We address five issues: the choice of the study population, the construction of genetic profiles, the measurement of the predictive value, calibration and validation of the predictive value, and finally assessment of the clinical utility of genetic profiles. These issues are illustrated using examples from recent studies on the predictive value of genetic profiling in common diseases. Methodological characteristics of these studies are listed in Table 2.Table 2 Methodological characteristics of recent studies on the prediction of complex diseases using multiple genes*Full size table","In the gene discovery phase, researchers often make use of highly selected series of patients and controls. Patients are selected for severe pathology, early onset and familial clustering of disease, and controls for the absence of pathology. This procedure substantially improves the statistical power of gene discovery research without creating any bias. But hyperselection of cases and controls can be a problem for evaluating the usefulness of genetic testing, as it typically leads to an overestimation of the effect sizes and, thus, to an overestimation of the predictive value. Effect sizes are inflated because frequencies of the risk genotypes are particularly increased in enriched patient populations and particularly decreased in controls that have no pathology related to the disease of interest.Table 2 shows that many studies on the predictive value of genetic profiling were conducted in hyperselected case-control series, comparing, for example, type 2 diabetes patients with normoglycemic individuals [10, 11], patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia with normolipidemic controls [12], or patients with end-stage AMD with individuals who have no eye pathology [13]. By excluding individuals with modestly elevated glucose or lipid levels, these case-control series largely lose their relevance for investigating predictive potential in clinical practice, where persons with such levels are part of the population. Predicting progression to disease is most difficult in individuals with early symptoms or mild pathology, but prediction in this population is clinically highly relevant. One could argue that if the predictive value of genetic profiling is low in the samples used in these studies [10–13], it will be even poorer in unselected cohorts. Thus, hyperselected case-control studies can be useful to demonstrate that predictive genetic testing is not informative and, given the commercial interest in genome-based applications, this is an important message to get across.Another consideration is the use of case-control studies in general, as illustrated by the recent findings on type 2 diabetes. Lango et al. [11] investigated the predictive value of 18 polymorphisms in a case-control study, comparing patients with normoglycemic controls, and van Hoek et al. [14] looked at the same polymorphisms in a prospective cohort of individuals aged 55 years and older. In both studies [11, 14], the AUC of the 18 polymorphisms was 0.60 and the improvement in AUC beyond prediction from age, sex and body mass index (BMI) was limited (ΔAUC = 0.02). But a more detailed analysis of the results reveals that even though the AUC was 0.60 in both studies, it was mainly contributed by different genetic variants in the two studies (Table 3). Moreover, the 0.02 improvement increased the AUC to 0.80 in the case-control study but to only 0.68 in the prospective cohort study. This difference is mostly explained by the difference in BMI. Mean BMI in the case-control study was 31.5 kg/m2 in patients and 26.9 kg/m2 in controls compared with 28.0 kg/m2 and 26.0 kg/m2 in the prospective cohort study, indicating that BMI was a stronger predictor of type 2 diabetes in the case-control study.Table 3 Effect estimates of 18 established susceptibility variants on type 2 diabetes risk in two studiesFull size tableCase-control studies tend to overestimate odds ratios and this may be related to selection bias (most likely the case in the example above) or information bias (patients may attribute a disease to a known risk factor and they over-report this exposure). An issue that is often ignored in gene discovery studies but that is extremely relevant in studies evaluating the predictive value is that of survival bias. If genes increase the risk of disease, they may also increase the risk of (early) mortality. Therefore, there are strong arguments that show the necessity that predictive testing in preventive medicine should be investigated in cohort studies consisting of individuals who do not have the disease of interest, and predictive testing for prognosis and therapy response should be evaluated prospectively in clinically relevant patient series.There is no single golden standard by which study population and study design should be selected, other than that predictive genetic tests need to be evaluated in populations representative for their intended use. The choice of the target population is not arbitrary, but rather is a trade-off of the effectiveness, costs and harmful side effects of available interventions, among other factors. Table 2 shows three prospective cohort studies evaluating the prediction of coronary heart disease, one in Caucasian men of European ancestry aged 50-64 years [15], one in a general population of 45-64 years [16] and one in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia [17]. These different study populations assume different target populations for genetic profiling, and the predictive value will differ between these populations when disease risks, genotype frequencies and effect sizes are different.","When the predictive value of a limited number of variants is investigated in a large population-based study, disease risks can be calculated as the percentage of patients for each combination of genotypes. However, the number of genotype combinations increases exponentially with the number of variants tested. For example, combining 18 variants that have three possible genotypes, as did two studies of type 2 diabetes, theoretically yields 387,420,489 (318) unique profiles. To deal with such a large number, researchers adopt one of two approaches for the calculation of disease risks. First, they may calculate risk allele scores or genotype scores obtained by counting the number of risk alleles across all variants [10, 11, 14–23]. This approach assumes that the differences between the effects of the individual variants can be ignored, which may be a realistic assumption for multifactorial disorders given that the effect sizes are generally small [24]. Second, researchers may use logistic or Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for risk prediction, which do account for differences in effects sizes between individual variants. Risk predictions from regression analysis can be regarded as weighted risk scores. Table 2 shows that all studies applied either logistic or Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, some in addition to the simpler risk allele scores.In addition to the question of how to combine genetic variants into profiles, the question arises as to which of the variants to include. Several studies include variants that were already established risk factors (Table 2) [11, 12, 14, 19, 21–23, 25]. Others include polymorphisms from candidate genes or regions that have been associated with disease risk in at least one other study or that are likely to be functionally implicated (for example, [13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 26, 27]). And again others include polymorphisms identified in their own genome-wide association study [10, 28]. Although the distinction between candidate and established variants is not crystal clear and findings from genome-wide association studies may be robust, we can expect that the predictive value of variants that are less convincingly established is less likely to be replicated in independent populations.Another important issue in obtaining accurate estimates of the genetic predisposition at the individual level is how to handle gene-gene and gene-environment interaction in the prediction of common diseases. It is frequently argued that strong effects can be seen from the interaction of a gene with other genetic variants or environmental factors. Several studies reported in Table 2 investigated the presence of gene-gene interaction [19, 23, 26], but none included interaction effects in the regression models. The reported effect sizes for interaction terms were very modest, implying that the influence on the predictive value of risk profiles would have been limited [19]. When future studies give robust evidence for interaction, these interaction effects should be taken into account in the risk prediction.Last but not least, we can anticipate improvement in the predictive value when we can identify the exact causal variants. Most variants that are included in the genetic profiles shown in Table 2 are derived directly from genome-wide association studies. There is a growing awareness that these might not be the causal variants and that the causal variants may have a very different allele distribution in patients and controls. It is anticipated that the causal variants will have stronger effects on disease risk. The large deep-sequencing efforts that are ongoing may shed light on this question.","The question of how well genetic profiles can predict disease can be answered by many different performance measures, which all are related but which highlight different features. Which measure is of interest depends on the question addressed. Individuals who undergo genetic testing will be most interested in their absolute risks of disease conditional on their genetic profile. Only a few empirical studies have presented absolute risks [14, 17, 18], most likely because these cannot be calculated from case-control data without assumptions on the incidence of disease. Many other studies have reported used risk ratios (odds ratios, relative risks or hazard ratios), which each compare the risks of disease with a reference risk, namely that of individuals who carry no risk alleles. Here, also, evaluation studies diverge from gene discovery studies. Although the comparison with those with the lowest number of risk alleles is a valid approach and the recommended strategy in gene-discovery studies, it is less relevant in translational studies. Individuals who undergo genetic testing and receive their results are not interested in learning their risk compared with individuals who have an extremely low risk of disease [29] but rather compared with the average risk of disease, that is, the risk before testing, which for a common disease such as type 2 diabetes may be as high as 10%. Thus, comparing the risk or odds of disease with those with the average risk is more appropriate [29].When deciding about whether or not to perform a test from a clinical perspective, physicians need to know to what extent a test can make a difference. This makes them more interested in the distribution of risk allele scores and, related to that, the distribution of risks and risk ratios. Many empirical studies do present distributions of risk allele scores [10, 11, 16, 18–22], and several others do present risks associated with the risk allele scores but do not show their distribution (Table 2) [13, 14, 17, 23, 25, 27, 30]. These distributions are all different presentations of the discriminative accuracy of a test, generally measured as the AUC (see earlier). All but two [23, 30] of the studies shown in Table 2 evaluated the AUC of genetic profiling. Despite reported shortcomings [31–33], AUC is very suitable as a first screening indication of predictive value. Further evaluation of clinical validity and utility is warranted only if a reasonable AUC is demonstrated at first. This further evaluation can include evaluation of absolute risks, reclassification [31], net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement [32]. The value of reclassification should not be overestimated, as illustrated by the study of Kathiresan and colleagues [18], who studied the addition of genetic factors to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In this study, adding genetic variants did not improve the AUC, but 26% of the individuals in the intermediate risk group (absolute risks 10-20%) were reclassified into the lower and higher risk groups. A closer look at the findings shows that the observed risk of those who were reclassified to the lower risk group was 8.2%, only slightly lower than the cut-off value of 10%, and the observed risk of those reclassified to the highest risk category was 14.7%, which was similar to the observed risk among those who remained in the intermediate category (14.5%). Reclassification may thus not lead to better classification when no improvement in AUC is seen."
2,Genetic and Preventive Services for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in the Czech Republic,"The incidence of breast cancer has doubled over the past twenty years in the Czech Republic. In 5-10% of breast cancers, hereditary factors may be a cause of young onset, bilateral breast or ovarian cancer and familial accumulation of the disease. Genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 predisposition genes has been available in the Czech Republic since 1997 in two major molecular genetic laboratories - one in Brno (Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, MMCI) and the other in Prague (Department of Biochemistry and Experimental Oncology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University).Genetic counselling services for hereditary cancer were started at MMCI in Brno in 1997. Currently the department comprises a genetic clinic and a molecular genetic laboratory. The laboratory provides testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for about 65% of high-risk patients tested in the Czech Republic. Counselling and genetic testing is covered by health insurance and the laboratory is accredited within the institute and undergoes EMQN quality testing annually. Eighty percent of tested patients are from the Moravian region (eastern) of the Czech Republic and 20% from the Bohemian (western) region. The second major laboratory in Prague is part of the First Faculty of Medicine in Charles University. The testing in this setting is covered by grants and the laboratory undergoes EMQN quality assessment every year. All patients tested are from the Bohemian region (mostly from in and around Prague) of the Czech Republic. Recently, molecular genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 has begun in two private laboratories where individual cases are analysed.Genetic counselling of high-risk patients or their families is now offered by medical geneticists working in 10 public genetic centres and in several private centres (Fig. 1). For persons wishing to be tested a counselling session prior to testing is provided and each patient who proceeds with testing must sign an informed consent document. Each patient receives a second counselling session at the time of being told their results and receives a very detailed genetic report.Figure 1The network of genetic centers offering oncology counselling in the Czech Republic.Full size image","The inclusion criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing are similar in both the Brno and Prague centres: i) families with three or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age; ii) families with only two cases of breast cancer, one at the age <50 years, with ovarian cancer at any age; iii) sporadic unilateral breast cancer <40 years (in Prague <35 years of age), sporadic unilateral ovarian cancer <40 years, breast and ovarian cancer at any age, male breast cancer iv) sporadic bilateral breast or ovarian cancer <50 years of age. In most families the testing is performed using DNA from a proband with breast or ovarian cancer having the highest probability of hereditary disease. In a small proportion of cases where no patient is living in a family the testing is performed on DNA from a high-risk healthy individual.Genetic testing is based on genomic DNA in Brno and the analysis of DNA and RNA in the Prague laboratory. Mutation detection methods have been described previously by Foretova et al., 2004, and Pohlreich et al., 2005 [1, 2]. All positive results from the screening tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were analysed by automated sequencing and were confirmed on a second sample of independently isolated DNA. All positive and negative predictive testing results are also confirmed on a second sample.","The spectrum of mutations found in the BRCA1 gene is similar in the Brno and Prague centres. The three most frequent mutations in the BRCA1 gene, which are responsible for about 69% of BRCA1 positive cases in Brno and 70.4% in Prague, are c.5385dupC, c.300T>G and c.3819_3823delGTAAA according to the BIC information database http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/. Other BRCA1 mutations were found to be scattered throughout the whole coding region of the gene. Three novel mutations were detected in the BRCA1 gene in patients from Brno (c.2607_2616dup10, c.2881delA and c.3761_3762delGA) and one in Prague (c.1866A>T) [1–3].The results of BRCA2 testing show significant differences between the two centres. In Brno, two mutations, c.8138_8142delCCTTT and c.8765_8766delAG, were detected in 41.5% of all BRCA2 positive cases. These two mutations were not observed in patients from the Prague region. In Brno individual mutations in the BRCA2 gene were scattered between exons 3 and 25 (most were frame-shift or nonsense changes) whereas all mutations detected in patients in the Prague laboratory were located in exon 10 and 11. Five novel mutations in BRCA2 were detected in Brno (c.5073_5074delCT, c.6677_6678de-lAA, c.6866delC, c.6982dupT, c.8397_8400dupTGGG) and two in Prague (c.4167delC, c.5991dupT) [1–3]. The spectrum of the five most frequent mutations in both genes is shown in fig. 2.Figure 2Frequencies of the five most frequent mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes detected in Brno and Prague centres (% of all detected mutations).Full size imageThe mutation detection rate was similar in both centres. Overall mutations were discovered in 28.9% of all tested index cases from Brno and in 26.9% from Prague. Thus far 700 index cases have been tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Brno and 245 patients in Prague.",Predictive testing is offered to relatives at risk and includes all men and women older than 18 years of age. All relatives have a genetic counselling session before and after testing. Predictive testing was offered to 445 relatives in Brno and 120 relatives in Prague.
