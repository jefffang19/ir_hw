0,Shedding new light on genetic dark matter,"The past three decades of studies have unveiled some of the genetic underpinnings of human disease. For complex diseases, those with obscure genetic roots, discoveries have accelerated recently owing to a bloom of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [1]. Nevertheless, even for the most successful cases (such as inflammatory and ulcerative bowel disease [2, 3]), discoveries account for only a fraction, often small, of the disease's heritability. These yet to be discovered genetic variants comprise the 'missing heritability' or the genetic 'dark matter' for disease.","Heritability, the proportion of trait variability explained by genetic factors, has two somewhat different meanings. Narrow-sense heritability involves only the additive effects of genes. Broad-sense heritability involves both additive and non-additive effects. The difference between the two makes a difference when hunting for dark matter. If genetic variation were all to act additively, the best predictor of an offspring's trait value would be the average of his/her parents' values. Human height is an excellent example, after adjusting for gender. Hunting for dark matter for a trait such as human height will be more straightforward than for a disease such as schizophrenia, for which the evidence for substantial gene-gene interaction is compelling [4]. Yet when researchers refer to heritability of human height, they implicitly mean narrow-sense heritability; for schizophrenia, it is heritability in a much broader sense.Why should we care about the genetic basis of disease? Greater understanding of the genetics equals greater understanding of molecular etiology and, with it, eventually more cogent treatments. However, the origins of some human diseases, especially those of the mind, can be mysterious. For diseases of the mind, few environmental or genetic risk factors are understood; instead the hope is that identified genetic factors will lead to a subtler understanding of why diseases such as schizophrenia arise and how they can be treated effectively. Even for cardiovascular disease, for which environmental risk factors are well characterized, new insights into its genetics could produce more targeted treatment. This leads to the other expectation - that greater genetic knowledge will pave the way for 'personalized' medicine. The rapid technological advances in genomics will soon make it feasible to sequence whole genomes at relatively low cost. The idea that each individual will have meaningful sequence variation in their medical records and will have interventions tailored to their risk profile and likely treatment response is quite appealing. The goal of personalized medicine, however, is hindered because so much molecular etiology remains in the dark.One way to explain more of the dark matter is to develop more efficient ways to use existing data. Naukkarinen et al. [5] develop an innovative approach that integrates gene expression and genotype data. They apply these ideas to a GWAS of obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI). Studies estimate BMI's heritability at 45 to 85%, but identified genetic variants explain about 1% of the total variance [6]. To discover more variants, the authors [5] examined gene expression of adipose tissue in a sample of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for BMI and in a sample of unrelated individuals. Because MZ twins are genetically identical, or nearly so, the authors reasoned that genes showing expression differences between twins are 'reactive' genes with differences that are due to regulatory or epigenetic changes in response to environmental factors. By contrast, genes uncovered in unrelated individuals are a combination of reactive and genetically 'causal' genes. By contrasting results from the unrelated sample and discordant MZ twins, the authors identified 27 causal genes that were differentially regulated. They then tested 197 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) falling in and around these genes in a sample of 21,000 subjects. They discovered a significant excess of small P-values in this set of SNPs. Neither the set of SNPs defined by reactive genes nor the individual SNPs in the reactive set were associated with BMI. Notably, this work identifies a new gene, F13A1, which encodes the coagulation factor XIII A chain, with variation that affects BMI. This gene has also been identified by meta-analysis of 12 studies of venous thromboembolism [7]. Obesity is well known to predispose to vein thromboses; however, the study of Naukkarinen et al. [5] reveals a potential biological pathway for the relationship between obesity, thrombosis and cardiovascular risk.The methods advanced by Naukkarinen and colleagues [5] require discordant MZ twins, which were available for BMI. This experimental design could prove highly informative for similar quantitative traits, for which extremes are easily identified and by which the pathology or phenotype of interest is defined. For some diseases, especially diseases of the brain, quantitative traits that map precisely onto risk are not yet available. In addition, because reactive genes are environment-dependent, successful implementation of this design might require a sample exposed to a homogeneous environment, limiting its generality. Regardless, this study shows how innovative research can cast more light on dark matter. Moreover, the study design could also inform us about pathways of correlated gene expression and how much these correlations are influenced by genetic and environmental variation.Many other methods and designs are available to illuminate dark matter [8â€“15]. One appealing approach teams gene-expression results with genome-wide association data to produce targeted hypothesis tests [8]. One possibility is to organize tests by expression quantitative trait loci affecting genes in pathways meaningful for the disease. Statistical methods for targeted testing are available, whether on the basis of prior information of the likelihood of an association between a SNP and the phenotype or on the basis of plausible disease pathways [9, 10]. Genetic variants with parental origin effects, or whose effects depend on the parent from whom they were inherited, could be part of the dark matter; methods are now available to determine the parental origin of alleles and haplotypes even in the absence of genotyped parents [13]. Studies of copy number variants and their inheritance in families could also reveal insight into plausible biological pathways for disease [14, 15]. It is also safe to say that rare variants account for some of the dark matter [16], possibly the majority of it in some cases. Next-generation sequencing promises to fill some of our void in knowledge by identifying more penetrant but rarer variants.Other approaches are less illuminating. Let's reconsider human height. We know numerous rare variants and about 50 common variants that have an impact on height. Thus far, known genetics account for roughly 5% of the variance. Using many SNPs from GWAS analysis that are not significantly associated with height, Yang et al. [17] estimated the proportion of variance in height explained by SNPs as 0.45 and even got close to the heritability estimate of 0.84 after correcting for incomplete linkage disequilibrium between SNPs genotyped and causal variants. In spirit, this approach [17] is similar to the allele score method [18], which seeks a predictive model for disease status on the basis of thousands of SNPs with modest evidence for association. If their results are correct, both studies [17, 18] suggest that the effects of SNPs are small and will be difficult or impossible to detect from simple analyses of GWASs, at least for current sample sizes [19]. These intriguing approaches have some drawbacks: they shed no new light on the molecular etiology of phenotype; and inherent in the calculations are assumptions that could prove difficult to validate.We all recognize the hidden biases that inflate estimates of heritability. There are other complex pathways for the transmission of a phenotype across generations without the transmission of a specific common or rare variant, namely through epigenetic factors that can result in the inheritance of gene expression patterns without an alteration of the DNA sequence [20]. Gene-environment interactions could also affect the estimates of heritability and when they are in play, they can explain as much of the variance in the phenotype as genetic factors [21].","Concerted effort will almost surely be required to understand the genetic architecture of most complex diseases. Naukkarinen et al.'s [5] novel study design illustrates the impact that concerted effort can have in advancing our knowledge of the genetic etiology of such diseases. There remains ample room for novel analytic methods and study designs to shed light on the genetic dark matter of disease. It is entirely possible, 10 years hence, that we will realize that much of the missing heritability was hiding in plain sight in common variants.","BD is Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Human Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh.

1,Clinical utility of genetic tests for inherited hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies,"The success of the Human Genome Project and the recent discoveries in the area of genetics promise to significantly change the clinical practice of cardiology, providing new tools for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis of disease as well as for a better prediction about health risks for the family [1, 2].Rapid advances in the technology and reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing have led to increasingly rapid translation of genomic information into clinical applications [3]. As a consequence the number of genetic tests is growing, and becoming currently available for clinical testing [4]. However, genetic tests are generally time-consuming and expensive, and they should be used with sufficient consideration of their necessity and value in managing the patient's condition. Therefore, it is imperative that cardiologists know the basis for genetic cardiovascular disorders and the medical implications of these defects in order to improve their expertise as well as to ensure an appropriate practical use of genetic tests in the clinical setting. The purpose of this paper is to provide a concise overview of the genetic etiology as well as the clinical utilities and limitations of genetic testing for the heritable form of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies.","Diseases identified as ""genetic"" can be typically classified into two categories: Mendelian diseases and multifactorial diseases. Mendelian diseases or monogenic diseases are rare, and only one mutation in a given gene is responsible for inheritance of the disease in a given family. Genetic diseases, in the second group, occur more commonly in the population and are often recognized as ""running in families"" [5]. The genetic model underlying a multifactorial disease is often complex since it may be related to the interaction or additive effect of multiple genes as well as to the presence or absence of environmental factors (Figure 1). Congenital heart disease, coronary heart disease, venous thrombosis, and diabetes mellitus fall into this category.Figure 1
Single gene disorders or complex traits. A single rare mutation can fully account for a Mendelian disease; clinical variability can be, however, observed even for determined monogenic disease, and this variability may itself involve genetic factors, the so-called modifier genes. In contrast to monogenic traits, complex traits have many contributing genes and non-genetic influences.Full size image
Heritable hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies are monogenic diseases, caused by mutations in key genes that lead to the absence or abnormality of myocardial proteins [5].Disease-causing gene mutations have been identified in approximately two-thirds of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and about 50% of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).Various types of mutations can occur in DNA, including non-sense (stop codons), missense mutations (causing aminoacid substitution) and splice-site. Mostly, newly detected mutations for heritable cardiovascular disorders are missense. For these mutations, it is difficult to establish their pathogenicity, unless specific functional test are available. Presently, pathogenicity is presumed when the substitution affects a very conserved sequence through evolution, or it was reportedly associated to disease in independent patients.The accurate reconstruction of family history is crucial element for diagnosis of genetic cardiomyopathy [6].The family history should encompass at least 3 generations with a careful and complete history about the family members, including demographic and medical information [7].The family history may provide additional relevant information, such as age of onset and penetrance, and help to identify the patterns of inheritance (Figure 2).Figure 2
Autosomal and X-linked patterns of inheritance. In autosomal dominant inheritance, family history typically reveals that the disorder is usually present in every generation, and there is a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. In autosomal recessive inheritance, the condition appears to ""skip"" generations. Parents of an affected have a 25% chance of having an affected child and a 50% chance of having a carrier child in each pregnancy. In X-linked dominant inheritance, all daughters of an affected man are affected, sons and daughters of carrier women have a 50% risk of being affected. In X-linked recessive inheritance, there is a 50% chance that each son of a carrier woman will also be affected. No male-male transmission is observed.Full size image
In addition, information of cardiovascular tests and procedures (echocardiography, electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplant) should always be recorded as part of the family history [6].However, inherited cardiomyopathies show a wide range of clinical presentation within the same family, with incomplete and age-dependent penetrance. Genotype-phenotype relations are complex and not yet completely understood. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists even among individuals who have identical mutations at the disease-causing locus.Conversely, mutations in different genes can result in a similar phenotype. The incompleteness of genotype-phenotype correlations has limited the use of genetic testing in clinical practice. In selected cases, DNA target analysis has, however, potential clinical value, and genetic testing should be done in patients and families.","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common and autosomal dominant genetic heart disease (1:500 of the general population), typically diagnosed by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy with 2-dimensional echocardiography (or alternatively with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) [8, 9]. Left ventricular hypertrophy, often disproportionately affecting the ventricular septum, can range from mild (~13â€“15 mm) to severe (30â€“60 mm). The clinical spectrum of HCM is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those with disabling symptoms of heart failure, exercise intolerance, arrhythmias and chest pain [9].Moreover, HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young (including trained athletes), who are often unaware of their underlying condition. Early diagnosis of HCM is important, since at-risk individuals may be advised not to participate in competitive sports and should undergo regular cardiac screening to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death [10].HCM is caused by a variety of mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, especially in cardiac myosin heavy chain beta (MYH7), myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) [8â€“11]. To date, over 700 individual mutations have been identified (for a list of gene mutations see http://cardiogenomics.med.harvard.edu/project-detail?project_id=230.Mutations in the genes coding for 3 sarcomeric proteins (MYH7; MYBPC3; TNNT2), most commonly are estimated to account for about 60% of all familial cases of HCM (Table 1). Clinical testing for variants in most of these genes is available and can provide valuable therapeutic and prognostic information.Table 1 Gene mutations in sarcomere-related genes in HCM.Full size table
Overall, clinical diversity of HCM can reflect the broad spectrum of underlying molecular cause.Some specific mutations have been recognized to be associated with strong clinical effect [10â€“15]. In particular, some missense mutations in the gene of the MYH7 (R403Q, R453C, G716R and R719W) were associated with early onset and poor clinical prognosis, including sudden death. Moreover, mutations in the TNNT2 gene (R92Q and Î”E160) have been associated with high incidence of cardiac sudden death in young men, even with mild hypertrophy. In contrast, patients with mutations in the MYBPC3 can have a late onset and a relatively good prognosis [8â€“11].Nevertheless, defining precise genotype-phenotype correlations has been limited by the low frequency of each mutation. Studies of HCM families have also shown the presence of clinical variability among individual with identical mutations. Moreover, the clinical presentation within a given kindred may vary between family members, with mild clinical symptoms manifested in one relative and early-onset heart disease in another. Such interfamilial variable expressivity may be explained by genetic and environmental modifying factors. The identification of other genetic alterations that might play a role in modulating the presentation of disease is, thus, crucial in order to improve gene-based diagnosis.Recently, nonsarcomeric protein mutations in 2 genes (gamma-2 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase, PRKAG2, and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, LAMP2) involved in glycogen accumulation in cardiac myocytes have also been reported to be responsible for a less common type of HCM, known as metabolic HCM [13]. Clinical features of metabolic HCM are also the high prevalence of electrical abnormalities (ventricular pre-excitation and atrial fibrillation) and faster progression from hypertrophy to dilation and severe heart failure with respect to HCM. Mutations in the PRKAG2 or in LAMP2 genes are believed to account for about 1% of all HCM and for up to 50% of HCM with ventricular preexcitation [16â€“18].Genetic testing for mutant genes is the most definitive method for establishing the diagnosis of HCM, and some genotype-phenotype correlations can be useful to address DNA analyses in specific genes. For example, HCM with late onset, good prognosis and mild hypertrophy can help to target DNA analysis for MYBPC3 mutations. Conversely, the presence a more malignant phenotype with a high risk of SCD, may guide genetic screening for MYH7 mutations in the presence of severe hypertrophy or TNNT2 mutations if the degree of hypertrophy is mild (Figure 3).Figure 3

However, caution is required because genotype-phenotype correlations are based on a small population. In addition, the coinheritance of compound mutations (more than 1 mutation in a single gene, or mutations in 2 different genes) is more common than might be expected and can explain why different families that appear to have the same mutation can behave differently.","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common (estimated 1:2500 persons) and largely irreversible form of heart muscle disease; it is the third most common cause of heart failure in the young and a major cause of heart transplantation [9].DCM, diagnosed by 2-dimensional echocardiography, is characterized by left ventricular dilation and impaired left ventricular systolic function, often with involvement of the right ventricle, which then lead to ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, conduction system abnormalities, thromboembolism, and sudden or heart failure-related death.DCM may derive from a particularly broad range of primary causes, including infectious agents, toxins, chronic excessive consumption of alcohol, chemotherapeutic agents, autoimmune, neuromuscular disorders, mitochondrial, metabolic and endocrine disorders.Approximately one half of patients with the disease are found to have ""idiopathic"" DCM, indicating that the cause for the condition cannot be determined. About one-third to one-half of ""idiopathic"" DCM cases has a positive family history in â‰¥ 2 closely related relatives. These patients are considered to have familial dilated cardiomyopathy [19].It is noteworthy that familial DCM is clinically and diagnostically the same as other forms of DCM, so careful attention to family history is essential.Inheritance patterns of familial DCM include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked. The autosomal dominant forms are the most common inheritance accounting for about 85â€“90% of cases.DCM exhibits high genetic heterogeneity as mutations in > 20 genes have been associated with the disease, such as desmin, tafazzin, Î´-sarcoglycan, dystrophin, and metavinculin, and nuclear envelope proteins such as emerin and lamin A/C [20].Mutations in the sarcomere genes, which are responsible for causing HCM, are also associated with DCM. To date, sarcomere gene mutations (MYBPC3; MYH7;TNNT2; cardiac troponin I, TNNI3; Î±-tropomyosin,TPM1; cardiac actin, ACTC) account for approximately 10â€“16% of familial DCM [21, 22].At the present time, genetic screening in all known disease genes is not possible. However, lamin A/C (LMNA) is the most frequent disease associated gene for familial DCM with conduction system disease.The LMNA gene encodes the two differentially spliced proteins lamin A and lamin C, the major components of the nuclear lamina, which localizes at the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane as a meshwork structure (Figure 4) [23, 24]. Lamin interacts directly with the chromatin and also with the integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, thereby playing a role in maintaining the structural integrity and spatial organization of other inner nuclear membrane. During the last years, clinically distinct disease phenotypes have been attributed to LMNA mutations-termed ""laminopathies""-ranging from accelerated aging disorders to striated muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy [24, 25].Figure 4

Exon 11 and part of exon 12 encode for lamin A (664 aminoacids) while the alternatively spliced part of exon 10 encodes for the lamin C (572 aminoacids) isoform.Full size image
Indeed, the LMNA gene is involved in up to 30â€“50% of patients with cardiac conduction disorders and DCM [25â€“32]. Although mutations causing DCM can occur almost anywhere in LMNA, the domain coil 1B seems to be most frequently affected (Figure 5).Figure 5

The most prevalent LMNA mutation hot spot in familial DCM in Europe is codon 190 [32], a missense mutation (R190W) initially described by Arbustini and colleagues in an Italian family with severe DCM and SCD [30]. Subsequently, this variant was identified in DCM patients from other European countries, and even from Korea [33â€“35].A complete list for LMNA mutations causing DCM is available in: the Human Gene Mutation Database http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php, the locus specific LMNA database http://www.umd.be, and the Leiden Muscular Dystrophy pages http://www.dmd.nl.A meta-analysis of clinical characteristics of LMNA mutation carriers revealed that LMNA mutations carry a high risk of sudden death, and that this risk does not differ between subjects with predominantly cardiac or neuromuscular disease [36].Pasotti et al. have recently shown that dilated cardiomyopathies caused by LMNA gene defects are highly penetrant, adult onset, malignant diseases characterized by a high rate of heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias, predicted by New York Heart Association functional class, competitive sport activity, and type of mutation [37].All these studies indicate that DCM patients with LMNA mutations show remarkable homogenous clinical phenotypes with sinoatrial and atrioventricular node dysfunction, heart block commonly requiring pacemakers, atrial fibrillation, other supraventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and a malignant course with heart failure necessitating heart transplantation.Therefore, it is highly recommended to screen LMNA for genetic variants when such clinical features are present in a DCM patient.The LMNA genetic testing may allow useful diagnosis of mutations clearly correlated with a worse prognosis as well as identify early ""presymptomatic"" relatives at greatest risk for developing DCM (Figure 5)."
2,Influence of ethnicity on the distribution of genetic polymorphisms associated with risk of chronic liver disease in South American populations,"The global health and economic burden of chronic liver disease is substantial and on the rise, due in part to the growing incidence of hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis [1, 2]. The increase in cirrhosis, along with a surge in the prevalence of its risk factors such as alcohol abuse and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), has resulted in a growing incidence of primary liver cancer [3]. The major histological subtype of primary liver malignancies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), represents the end stage of the natural history of chronic liver disease and has become the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and the major indication for liver transplant in Europe and USA [4].Hepatic steatosis is the most common pathological finding in liver biopsies around the world [5]. Although its association with liver inflammation is an evidence suggestive of alcohol-induced liver injury, it has also been described in individuals with no significant history of alcohol ingestion [6, 7]. The term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been adopted to cover the full spectrum of metabolic fatty liver disorders, as it ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis with severe disruption of the normal architecture and function of the liver leading to cirrhosis [6, 7]. Increasing rates of NAFLD and NASH -the most common forms of chronic liver disease in Western countries- have been reported as the worldwide prevalence of obesity continues to rise [5â€“7]. In turn, obesity, NAFLD and NASH are increasingly recognized triggers involved in the development of both cirrhosis and HCC [8].There is consistent evidence that the burden of chronic liver disease is greater among certain ethnic groups, particularly in areas characterized by high rates of chronic infection with hepatitis viruses [9]. Moreover, racial disparities in the prevalence and clinical presentation of chronic liver disorders have frequently been reported. In fact, Hispanics have a higher prevalence of steatohepatitis, NAFLD and cirrhosis, whereas African-Americans are less prone to develop liver failure [10â€“12].Besides viral, environmental, behavioral, and metabolic features, genetic factors have also been implicated in the different susceptibility to develop HCC [13]. In the last few years, several studies have established the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different genes -such as the patatin-like phospholipase-3 (PNPLA3), vitamin D receptor (VDR), transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), beta-parvin (PARVB) and sorting and assembly machinery component 50 (SAMM50) genes- as causal variants for chronic liver diseases and their progression towards HCC [14â€“17]. This study will focus only on the PNPLA3 and VDR polymorphisms.A genome-wide association study in a population comprising Hispanic, African-American and Caucasian subjects revealed that the SNP rs738409Câ€‰>â€‰G, which encodes an isoleucine-to-methionine substitution at position 148 (I148M) in the PNPLA3 gene, is the strongest determinant of hepatic steatosis [18]. Many other studies in Asian, European and Latin American populations have since confirmed this association and shown the implication of this genetic variant in chronic liver disorders ranging from NAFLD and NASH to cirrhosis and HCC [19â€“22].Moreover, the progression of chronic liver diseases is related to the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the VDR gene. In fact, decreased vitamin D levels have increasingly been recognized in various forms of chronic liver disease and associated with advanced fibrosis [23, 24]. Patients with NAFLD were found to present with reduced vitamin D levels, which were closely related to the histological severity of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis [25, 26].Several polymorphic sites -such as the bAt (CCA) haplotype consisting of the combination of SNPs rs1544410C (formerly BsmI), rs7975232C (ApaI) and rs731236A (TaqI)- have been described in the VDR gene [27]. These combined variants showed a significant association with the fibrosis progression rate and the occurrence of cirrhosis and HCC in Caucasian and Asian patients diagnosed with alcohol-induced liver injury as well as in those chronically infected with HCV [28â€“30].The prevalence of these polymorphisms differs among ethnic groups [18, 27]. However, there is a paucity of information about South American populations, whose genetic background is highly admixed as a result of generations of intermixing between various groups, including Native Americans, Spanish conquistadores, Africans and a large European immigrant population that arrived between 1870 and 1950. In the Argentinean population, for example, further sources of admixture have been introduced by local migration from the rural areas to the cities between 1930 and 1980, as well as by immigration from other South American countries [31, 32]. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of these genetic polymorphisms and their association with the genetic ancestry of South American populations, which may provide useful knowledge for establishing public health policies aimed at high risk ethnic populations.","The SNPs in PNPLA3 and VDR genes, associated to the development of chronic liver disease and progression towards liver cancer, have been characterized in 258 healthy unrelated male volunteers. The allele and genotype frequencies of these SNPs are presented in TableÂ 1. No significant differences in age were observed among the individuals carrying the different alleles. The distribution of homozygous and heterozygous carriers was consistent with the expectations of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square goodness-of-fit test: pâ€‰>â€‰0.05 for all SNPs in all groups).Table 1 Allele and genotype frequencies of SNPs rs738409 (PNPLA3), rs1544410, rs7975232, rs731236 and bAt (CCA) haplotype (VDR)Full size table
The molecular evaluation of maternal ancestry reveals that 74.4Â % of the 258 individuals exhibited Native American lineages (haplogroups A2, B2, C and D1; Fig.Â 1a); whereas, as regards paternal ancestry, only 23.6Â % of the samples showed the Native American Q1a3a haplogroup (Fig.Â 1b). Moreover, the combined analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) in each of the 258 recruited individuals revealed that more than half of them (57.8Â %) exhibited maternal Native American haplogroups and paternal Non-native American ancestry (admixed samples); whereas 17.8Â % and 24.4Â % of the studied samples showed Native American and Non-native American ancestry, respectively.Fig. 1Genetic ancestry of the study population.

The four studied SNPs were unevenly distributed among individuals with Non-native American ancestry compared with those with Native American ancestry (maternal or paternal lineages). In fact, the frequencies of bAt (CCA) haplotype (VDR gene) and the GG genotype of rs738409 polymorphism (PNPLA3 gene) were significantly higher among samples with Native American maternal ancestry (63.4Â % and 65.4Â %, respectively) compared with those with Non-native American maternal haplogroups (32.2Â % and 38.4Â %, respectively) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0005 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.0008, respectively; Fig.Â 2). In addition, these frequencies were unevenly distributed among individuals with Native American paternal ancestry compared with those with Non-native American paternal ancestry, being significantly higher in those with Native American haplogroups (54.9Â % and 53.1Â %, respectively) compared with those with Non-native American haplogroups (39.8Â % and 30.9Â %, respectively) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0424 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.0388, respectively; Fig.Â 3). Similar results were observed when examining the relationship between polymorphisms in VDR gene and ancestry (Additional files 1 and 2).Fig. 2Influence of maternal ethnic components on the genotype distribution.

When the prevalence of the SNP rs738409 (PNPLA3) was determined according to the combined ancestry of the samples (maternal and paternal lineages), the unfavorable genotype GG was significantly higher among samples with Native American lineages (63.7Â %), intermediate among admixed samples (45.1Â %, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and the lowest for samples with Non-native American ancestry (30.1Â %, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001; Fig.Â 4).Fig. 4Influence of maternal and paternal ethnic components on the genotype distribution.

Similar results were found when the three polymorphisms in VDR gene were examined (Additional file 3). As a consequence, the frequency of the bAt (CCA) haplotype -which is a result of the combination of the three SNPs- was significantly higher among samples with maternal and paternal Native American haplogroups (64.6Â %), intermediate among admixed samples (44.9Â %, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and the lowest for samples with Non-native American ancestry (29.6Â %, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0008; Fig.Â 4).","Chronic liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. The ethnic disparities reported in its burden, prevalence and clinical presentation are likely attributed to the interaction between environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors [1, 9]. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze ethnicity and polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to chronic liver disease and progression towards HCC in South American populations.The results presented herein reveal that the distribution of polymorphisms related to the development of chronic liver disease and progression towards liver cancer exhibits statistical significant differences according to ethnicity. In fact, the prevalence of host genetic factors associated with risk of liver steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis is significantly lower in individuals with Non-native American ancestry.In addition to ethnicity, other risk factors have been associated with the development of chronic liver disease, such as older age, male gender, alcohol abuse and HBV and/or HCV infection [1]. To ensure a representative sample of the general population in the region, 258 unrelated male volunteers were enrolled by two blood banks in Buenos Aires city. The exclusion of HBV and/or HCV infected subjects did not affect sampleâ€™s representativeness as prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in Argentina is lower than 1Â % [33].Moreover, the proportion of each ancestry pattern in the collected sample was consistent with previously reported frequencies in the general population [32], and therefore, no ethnic group was over or underrepresented in the sample. In this area of Argentina, the more prevalent ancestry components for maternal and paternal lineages are the European and the Native American, followed -to a lesser extent- by African haplogroups [32]. Therefore, these data suggest that the samples with Non-native American maternal and/or paternal haplogroups analyzed in this study would predominantly exhibit the European component. In addition, the process of admixture was -as in the rest of South America- sex-biased, generally involving a Native American maternal lineage and a Non-native American paternal lineage [32]. This finding is consistent with fact that the admixed group included in this study was characterized by Native American maternal ancestry and Non-native American paternal haplogroups.In general, men are 2-fold more likely to die from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis than are women. Liver transplant occurs less commonly in women than in men, with variable disease outcomes based on etiology [34]. A prospective study which analyzed epidemiological aspects of HCC in South America revealed that the situation in this region is no different from that in the rest of the world [35]. In this study, only male subjects were enrolled to assess both maternal and paternal lineages and determine the frequency of admixture in the studied population. In spite of this, the genotype prevalence of the studied SNPs must be considered as representative of the general population as it could not be modified by the lack of women in the recruited sample. However, it must be acknowledged that the interpretation of the results presented in this study may be affected by the possibility of sex difference in the genetic association of these polymorphisms and disease susceptibility. In fact, a negative correlation between male sex and the effect of rs738409 on liver fat content has been reported in NAFLD patients [36].In this report, the prevalence of the genetic polymorphisms associated with risk of chronic liver disease in Non-native and Native American samples is in agreement with previously described frequencies in European and South American populations [18, 20, 37].Regarding the GG genotype of SNP rs738409 in PNPLA3 gene, its frequency was significantly higher in individuals with Native American ancestry when compared with those exhibiting Non-native American haplogroups. In consistency with our results, a high prevalence of the unfavorable genotype was reported in Hispanics and in Argentinean patients with NALFD [18, 20]; but unfortunately, the ancestry components of these previously studied populations remain unknown.Furthermore, the analysis of VDR polymorphisms carried out in our study revealed intermediate frequencies between those reported for European and Asian samples, but similar to those previously published for Hispanics [37]. This result could be related to the high admixture levels observed in these populations, which could be explained by the combined ancestry of mestizos and the fact that Native American populations are descendants of nomadic Asian communities [37].In different populations, haplotype structure analysis of VDR gene has shown high genetic heterogeneity involving different haplotype blocks [37, 38]. In fact, studies carried out in admixed populations has revealed the importance of genetic heterogeneity since linkage disequilibrium increases or breaks down differently in different populations [39, 40]. Considering the recent admixture of Latin American people, the variation in the patterns of linkage disequilibrium is not surprising in view of demographic events and genetic factors such as drift and recombination during the process of admixture.From the genetic perspective, Hispanics or Latinos generally represent an intricate mixture of European, Native American, and African lineages, with the proportion of each ancestry component typically depending on country or area of origin [41]. Recent studies that have examined the relationships between self-identified ethnicity, self-estimated admixture proportions and genetic marker estimated admixture proportions revealed that Hispanics underestimate their degree of Native American admixture, confirming that ethnic self-identification is likely to be complex due to the heterogeneity in individual admixture proportions and social environments within this group [32, 42]. Due to its complex diversity, data obtained from relatively well-defined ethnic groups cannot be extrapolated to the majority of the South American population.Interethnic admixture is either common or rapidly increasing in many -if not most- populations as a result of human migrations. Therefore, in agreement with our results, molecular evaluation of ancestry is strongly recommended in studies including this type of multi-ethnic populations [43]. From this point of view, the South American population, with Native American, European and African ancestral roots, and five centuries of vast interethnic admixing, offers a unique model for examining the impact of admixture on the conceptual development and clinical implementation of the results obtained from genomics medicine studies.The results presented in this study intended to shed some light on the influence of ethnicity on the distribution of genetic polymorphisms associated with chronic liver disease in multi-ethnic and admixed populations. However, due to the multifactorial aspect of chronic liver diseases, the high prevalence of PNPLA3 and VDR genetic factors in Native Americans cannot be considered as the sole reason for the higher susceptibility of this ethnic group. Therefore, for the proper interpretation of the results presented herein, it must be taken into consideration that other genetic (e.g., SAMM50, PARVB, TM6SF2), environmental and behavioral factors may -as a whole- contribute to the higher risk of chronic liver disease in Native Americans [1â€“6, 16, 17]. In fact, the Hispanic population has high rates of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome [44] which suggest that other nutritional and genetic factors exert a role in the increased risk for chronic liver disease in this population, as well. Unfortunately, the prevalence of chronic liver disease in subjects with Native American ethnic components in the studied area remains unknown to clarify this hypothesis.In future decades, the prevalence of risk factors for chronic liver diseases, such as obesity, alcohol abuse and HCV chronic infection, is expected to rise [1, 2]. Hence, the identification of effective genetic markers for chronic liver disorders would be priceless as it would allow us to stratify populations according to susceptibility [45]. As a consequence, in areas exhibiting a highly admixed genetic background with a significant contribution of Native American ancestry components -and, therefore, less favorable genetic variants-, the results presented in this study are of substantial relevance for the regional public health.","In conclusion, this study shows -for the first time- that more than 60Â % of individuals with Native American ancestry are carriers of high risk genetic polymorphisms related to chronic liver disease and progression towards liver cancer. These data not only support the molecular evaluation of ancestry in multi-ethnic population studies, but also suggest that the characterization of these variants among the healthy South American population may be useful for establishing public health policies aimed at the organization of awareness-raising campaigns for high risk ethnic communities."
