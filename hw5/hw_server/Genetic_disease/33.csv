0,Public health in the genomic era: will Public Health Genomics contribute to major changes in the prevention of common diseases?,"Only 50 years after the discovery of the DNA structure by James Watson and Francis Crick, the scientific world completed the sequencing of the entire human genome, the Human Genome Project. As a consequence, the field of human genome research knew a rapid discovery phase with international initiatives like the ""1000 Genomes project"" or the ""Personal Genome Project"" and the development of the necessary technological tools [1]. Furthermore, there was a rise in the research field of the -omics: (epi)genomics, proteomics, interactomics, metabolomics, nutrinomics... These domains of systems biology gave rise to a better understanding of the human physiology and pathophysiology [2].Although the terms 'genetics' and 'genomics' are sometimes used interchangeably, they have a different meaning. Genetics is the science of inheritance and focuses on Mendelian inherited traits where mostly a mutation in one gene causes the disease. Genomics is the study of a complex set of genes, their expression and how they interact with other genes and the environment to affect how a condition develops.Classically, there is a distinction between environmental and genetic diseases. However, this point of view has changed. There is hardly any disease without a possible genetic contribution. The common diseases, or the complex diseases, are caused by an interplay of different genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. In 2006 the Institute of Medicine published a report in which it pointed out a critical need for transdisciplinary research that would integrate genomics and the biological sciences with the behavioural and social sciences, thus joining 'nature' and 'nurture' [3].Public health interventions have so far focussed on environmental-specific factors principally due to scientific and technological limits. The advances brought about by genomics are changing these perceptions. Exogenous influences will remain of vital importance for public health, but focussing merely on these influences may never equal the triumphs of the past [4]. To stay successful in promoting health and preventing disease, the effectiveness of public health interventions must be strengthened by incorporating all determinants of disease: the internal host-specific factors and their interactions with the environment [5].In 2005, a multidisciplinary group of eighteen experts form Canada, France, Germany, the UK and the US reached a consensus about how to develop genomics optimally for the benefit of population health [6]. An agreed concept for the enterprise of translating genome-based science and technology into improvements in population health was developed and is extensively discussed elsewhere [6, 7]. The experts defined Public Health Genomics (PHG) as ""the responsible, effective integration of genome-based knowledge and technologies into health services and public policy for the benefit of population health"". This article aims at giving an overview of the concepts of PHG, based on the elements of this definition. Thus, it will start to give an overview of the proposed steps to be taken to implement the results of basic science into public health benefits, followed by the role of epidemiology and the necessary epidemiological tools. Then it will continue by describing the use of genomics in current and future medical and public health practices and it concludes with an outline of the multidisciplinary character of PHG. The key issues of this article are highlighted in Table 1.Table 1 Challenges in Public Health Genomics and what public health authorities can do about them?Full size table
","The relation between a DNA sequence and a phenotype is far from simple. This means that the information about genes and DNA sequences must be translated into facts about genetic susceptibility to disease, the interaction between these susceptibilities and modifiable risk factors and the impact of this knowledge on population health. Khoury and co-workers presented a framework for the continuum of multidisciplinary translation research in genomic medicine [8]. The purpose is to move promising genomic applications to clinical and public health practice for population health benefit and consists of four phases: T1: gene discovery to candidate health application; T2: health application to evidence-based practice guidelines; T3: practice guidelines to health practice and T4: practice to population health impact [8].T1 research starts with gene discovery. However, this discovery alone is not enough, it has to be evaluated how genomic discoveries can be used to develop promising health applications. These are used either in clinical evaluation or in selection of effective therapeutic options. An emerging example of T1 research is the construction of ""genomic profiles"", testing combinations of genetic variants to predict increased risk of common diseases and potentially guide interventions [9]. T1 research in genomics comprises both observational studies and clinical trials. Human genetic epidemiology plays a fundamental role in this kind of knowledge integration. The Human Genome Epidemiology Network (HuGENet) is a global collaboration of individuals and organisations to assess population health impact of human genomics variation and how it can be used to improve health and prevent disease in populations [10]. This means that, before clinical applications can be considered, all the accumulated knowledge about a set of gene variants must be carefully assessed, including prevalence in different populations, the strength of the association with different disease endpoints, and interactions between gene variants and social and environmental determinants of risk. This results in rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of genetic associations, the HuGE reviews [11]. HuGENet further maintains a continuously updated knowledge base, called the HuGE Navigator which lists all the reported genetic associations with certain traits [12].An important application of HuGE research is the evaluation of clinical validity of complex genetic tests which is embraced as T2 research [8]. Nowadays the development and evaluation of genomic applications for use in practice is an unregulated process. Translation of a genetic test from research into practice starts with the identification of the disorder to be tested for, the specific test to be used, and the clinical scenario in which the test will be used (e.g. for diagnostic versus predictive purposes and the population to be tested). The genetic test can then be evaluated in a four-step process represented by the acronym ACCE: analytic validity, clinical validity, clinical utility and ethical, legal and social implications [8]. Analytic validity is the ability to accurately and reliably measure the genotype of interest [13]. Genetic tests should have high sensitivity, specificity and predictive values which are measured by the clinical validity. For complex genotypes the clinical validity of genetic tests is not clear and is likely to be poor for individual genetic variants. This is due to the lack of identification of all susceptibility-associated variants, their modes of interaction with each other and the environment. Clinical utility measures the risks and benefits of the genetic test for the management and control of the concerned disease [13]. Population and clinical-based studies are required to evaluate these criteria for a test in diverse populations. T2 research also comprises the evaluation of benefits and risks in a wide range of ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI). As genetics moves into the direction of genomics, and as a genetic test moves into the direction of genome-based health information, it becomes obvious that the ACCE framework is of limited use for evaluation. Instead, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) approach is already used and has been established as an evaluation tool within the European Member States in the last ten years [5]. This means that the end result of such research is a systematic review and synthesis of pieces of evidence that will support the development of evidence-based policy and practice guidelines [8, 14]. The translation of genomics into guidelines requires a novel type of action. New models of HTA are needed that can account for the unique types of evidence inherent to individualised targeted therapies [15]. CTA (constructive technology assessment), for example, is a means to guide early implementation of new developments in society and has been used to evaluate the introduction of a new diagnostic test in The Netherlands, the 70-gene prognosis indicator (MamaprintÂ®) for node-negative breast cancer patients [16].Phase 3 research, the translation of evidence-based guidelines to health practice is one of the most challenging problems in healthcare and disease prevention [8]. It comprises issues such as increasing the spread of knowledge about evidence-based interventions (dissemination research), integrating these interventions into existing programs and structures (implementation and health services research), and widespread adoption of these interventions by the whole range of stakeholders (diffusion research) [8]. Additional challenges include workforce training, public health literacy, information systems and public participation [17].The last phase of the continuum of translation research assesses how the adoption of evidence-based recommendations and guidelines can make an impact on real-world health outcomes [8]. T4 research often focusses on clinical and public health outcomes. Additionally, the population health impact should be monitored constantly. Therefore, in different populations there has to be a systematic evaluation of the added value of using genetic information on health outcomes (in terms of attributable risks); the scope and the purpose of using genome-based services; and the quality of the genetic information and counselling services [4, 5, 8].Nowadays, there are more than 350,000 published human genetics and genomics articles, but it is estimated that less than 3% deals with translation research T2 and beyond [8]. This means that evidence-based guidelines are very uncommon, and T4 research is even hardly done. Although moving scientific discoveries into policy and practice and the delivery of population-level health benefit has always been slow and difficult at best, many believe that this is a doable project when all relevant stakeholders on all levels are involved [5, 18].","One of the main contributions of genetic epidemiology is to have a more thorough understanding of the causes of complex diseases by taking notice of the genetic contribution to those disorders [4]. To date, many of the proposed advances resulted from genetic epidemiological research made use of methods like the investigation of familial clustering, twin, adoption and migration studies. The specific genetic determinants have been identified through linkage analysis and, more recently, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The national institutes of health defined a GWAS as a study of common genetic variation across the entire human genome designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits [19]. These studies use high-throughput genotyping technologies to assay hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and relate these genetic variants to diseases or health-related traits [19]. The molecular and cellular processes, which are encoded by the DNA sequence and thus possibly by the considered SNPs, are susceptible to influences from the external environment. Therefore, besides establishing the gene-disease association, studies on the gene-environment interaction must be addressed. Recently, the Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) consortium was initiated to address these issues [20]. One important disadvantage of GWAS is the occurrence of false-positive and false-negative associations. Therefore, the last part of a GWAS should be the replication of identified associations in an independent population sample [19]. Additionally, knowledge of genetic variants can be used to establish the causal nature of environmentally modifiable risk factors, through the application of ""Mendelian randomisation"" [18]. The basic principle in such studies is that if genetic variants either alter the level of or mirror the biological effects of a modifiable environmental exposure that itself alters disease risk, then these genetic variants should be related to disease risk to the extent predicted by their effect on exposure to the risk factor [18]. Because observational studies are prone to confounding, this can be a more reliable way to address environmental risk factors of disease. Furthermore, molecular epidemiology and systems epidemiology based on basic genomics research, epigenomic patterns and genome-environmental interactions are promising new developments in the field of epidemiology [21].Although the GWAS often offer robust associations between certain SNPs and complex diseases, the population implication of findings from many such studies are unclear because basic population-based genetic prevalence data are often unavailable [22]. Population-based research is essential to quantify the population prevalence of genetic variants, the magnitude of disease risk associated with these variants (in relative and absolute terms), the contribution of these variants to the occurrence of disease in different populations (attributable risk), the existence of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions and the validity of genetic tests based on such variants in predicting disease risk [10, 23]. One of the aims of the HuGE reviews is to promote the completion of reviews, which are peer-reviewed, systematic synopses of the epidemiological aspects of variation in particular genetic variants and health outcomes [11]. A major future challenge is to rethink these approaches in the light of personalised medicine and healthcare: the more evidence is provided on the individual (personal) level, the less evidence can be expected on the population level due to interindividual genomic variation including individual epigenomic effects.Genetic epidemiology research relies heavily on routine health records such as electronic patient records or disease registries for the identification of disease cases, controls or risk factor information and risk patterns. Whereas the use of routine datasets for genetic research is well established the opposite has not taken place; that is, the contribution of routinely collected data to translate findings from research into population health activities such as surveillance, needs assessment, health promotion and disease prevention programmes and evaluation [24]. Anyhow, epidemiological approaches are fundamental to the population-based biobanks being proposed for gene discoveries and characterisation, as well as to large case-control studies of common diseases using whole genome association analyses [25, 26].The discussion about the relevance of integrating genome-based information into biobanks and about the role of genome-based biobanking for epidemiological research and public health is still in its early stages [26]. In the meantime, various cancer registries and neonatal screening programmes have expanded their existing databases with genotyping to study disease incidence and prevalence, natural history and risk factors. In addition, huge amounts of biological materials are collected to quantify disease incidences in various populations and subpopulations and to gain an insight into the risk factors, including genome-environment interactions. These biobanks are based on large cohort studies (for example in the UK [27]), or even concerned a whole population (for example in Iceland [28]). Nevertheless, the majority of existing biobanks are still relatively small collections of tissue samples related to specific diseases such as cancer.The future challenges for biobanks with respect to epidemiological research and public health are numerous. They include the incorporation of genomics into existing public health programmes and the integration of genome-based knowledge into future surveillance systems [26, 29]. Thus we can explore the use of existing data sources to enhance the contribution of genomics to population health [24]. Possibilities are abundant. One plain example is disease surveillance. Genomics forms an essential part of public health work to combat infectious diseases. Sequencing of pathogens, for example, can allow rapid diagnosis and control of disease. To understand the host response to pathogens and the association of genetic variants with susceptibility or resistance to disease, human genomics research is of great value. But routine datasets are also central to the surveillance of non-infectious disease and here too, the understanding of genomic health determinants as a factor in disease development will be essential. Screening for genetic disease, although by biochemical methods, was already initiated in the early 1960s with phenylketonuria testing and application of the Guthrie test in newborns [30]. Most genetic screening programmes today are limited to single gene and chromosomal disorders and entail different aims like the identification of affected individuals through neonatal or antenatal screening or pre-conceptual testing of couples. Routine databases could also play a role in personalised disease prevention programmes by assisting the identification and targeting of patients in the various screening groups and the management and evaluation of programmes [24]. In the future it could be interesting to link the individual information during the whole life span, with the aid of the electronic patient records [26].","Concrete applications of genomics in public health, especially based on GWAS, are most pronounced in the field of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics [31]. These themes originated by the notion of the existence of large interindividual differences on drug reaction. A certain drug can have a therapeutic effect on some, but can be ineffective in others and certain people show adverse drug effects on a dose which is subeffective by others. Pharmacogenetics is based on the principle that it is time to use the right drug in the right dose in the right patient at the right time using integrated clinical and genomics parameters [32]. One well-known therapeutic example is the selected use of Trastuzumab, only in patients whose breast tumour expresses the her2/neu gene [33]. The recommendation of the FDA to select the starting dose of Warfarin to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms is another example of a well-introduced application of genomics into clinical practice [34]. Apart from these, the number of examples based on GWAS in pharmacogenomics are increasing (see the recent review of Wang et al [31]). However, although pharmacogenomics acknowledges the central role of the genetic constitution of a patient to drug metabolism, numerous other factors alter drug response including other drugs, environmental and physiological factors such as nutrition, ageing, liver and kidney function and patient compliance, which in the end results in the understanding of individual pathways in systems biomedicine.Personalised medicine is the translation of the science of pharmacogenomics and other individualised interventions into clinical practice [35]. Personalised medicine involves preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions, with risk defined through genetics as well as clinical and family histories. An example is genetic testing to determine the risk of breast cancer. Women carrying a certain BRCA1 mutation have a cumulative risk of 65% by the age of 70 years to develop breast cancer [36]. However, currently there are no standard criteria for recommending or referring someone for BRCA mutation testing. Candidates for BRCA genetic testing are identified through careful analysis of the family history, the patient's ethnic group and the pathologic features of the breast cancer [37, 38]. Further studies on the genetic hallmarks of breast tumours indicated that early and inherent genetic properties of the tumour entail the tumours' ability to metastasise [39]. A Dutch research group identified a gene-expression profile, based on 70 genes, that turns out to be a powerful predictor of disease outcome in young patients [40]. This will allow clinicians to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant systemic treatment, reducing the rate of both overtreatment and undertreatment [40].Expectations about the future impact of the discoveries through the GWAS on preventive and clinical health care practice are high. Despite the current euphoria, the predictive value of genetic profiling is still limited for most complex disorders [41]. This is because most individual gene variants associated with common diseases will have low positive predictive value and associated attributable risk [7]. Also, for some known markers much remains to be learned about their contribution to the incidence of disease [42]. For example, homozygotes for the APOE Îµ4 gene variant suffer from an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, but many people who test positive for this allele will not develop Alzheimer's disease [7]. In fact, fewer than 30% of people with the APOE Îµ4 polymorphism develop Alzheimer's disease [43]. Thus, notwithstanding the growing availability of commercial, direct-to-consumer genetic testing via the internet, evidence-based applications of genetic profiling in clinical and public health care practice are still a far future prospect. Nevertheless, current dynamic developments such as in systems biology, epigenomics and the Personal Genome Project (PGP) ask for different approaches having the potential for personalised medicine and healthcare, since they provide insights and evidence on the individual level [2]. Most of the scientific attention should, therefore, be focussed on basic genomic research, unravelling the understanding of common diseases in all its complexity and all its interactions [41]."
1,Locally weighted transmission/disequilibrium test for genetic association analysis,"High-dimensional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data have become increasingly available due to the advancement of high throughput genotyping technologies. These data enable researchers unprecedented capabilities for localizing regions that may be associated with the disease. An often-used strategy for searching for disease-causing genes is to first perform linkage analyses using genome-wide microsatellite or SNP markers to identify a rough candidate region that may harbor the latent disease susceptible gene. In the second stage, dense SNP markers in this candidate region are genotyped so that the location of the disease gene can be further refined. The advantages of this mapping strategy are that it is cost-effective and avoids an untargeted fishing expedition.In this paper, we focus on the second stage, where a large number of dense markers are genotyped on the study participants. Note that the markers at this stage have already been shown to be closely linked to the disease loci, in other words, linkage analysis has reached its resolution in locating the genes. One may need to rely on the linkage disequilibrium (LD), which measures the allelic association, for further refinement. The LD between a marker locus and the disease locus is thought to decay at a rate of (1-Î¸)N, where N is the number of generations since the introduction of the disease-causing mutation and Î¸ is the genetic distance between the two loci. The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) [1] that aims to assess the linkage and LD between a marker locus and disease loci has become popular. The TDT has since been extended to multiple tightly linked markers [2] by constructing haplotypes statistically to account for local dependency in the presence of phase ambiguity.As an alternative to haplotype-based approaches, we proposed an approach that weights the contribution of multiple SNPs according to their association with the locus of interest. This approach does not require determination of haplotypes. The idea is similar to kernel smoothing in nonparametric regression methods [3], where the kernel function is like a sliding window and markers that fall in the window all contribute to the test statistic but with differential weights. The weight here is determined by the distance and correlation of the markers to the locus of interest.Kofendrerd Personality Disorder (KPD) is a psychiatric syndrome characterized by an overwhelming concern with the meaning of the patient's inner emotions and world view and at the same time subsuming the emotions of others into the self. Nosology for KPD falls into three different groups: 1) ""communally shared emotions"" symptoms such as joining/founding cults and fear or discomfort with strangers; 2) behavior-related symptoms such as fascination with automobiles and aversion to walking; 3) anxiety-related symptoms such as morbid anger/fear/terror concerning rain/snow and reluctance to wear clothing appropriate for subjective temperature. All three or combination thereof have been used for diagnosis of KPD. The condition is thought to be genetic in origin, possibly exacerbated by prevailing social conditions.In this paper we analyzed the data collected from the Aipotu country, a populous semi-tropical, semi-desert country with a high prevalence of KPD. The cases were classified as anyone with ""notable clusters"" of symptoms from any of the three groups as KPD. The families in this dataset were ascertained when at least two siblings could be classified under any of the diagnostic groups or any combination.","Consider K case-parent trios in which each individual is genotyped with the same M autosomal markers at {t1, ..., t
M
}. Using Liang et al.'s [4] notation, denote Î¦ the disease status of the kth offspring for k = 1, ..., K. Let H(t) and h(t) be the two alleles at marker locus t. For simplicity, we use h to denote the rare alleles among the affected offspring. This, however, is neither necessary nor consequential. For the kth trio, the transmission status Y
k
(t) for paternal alleles at locus t can be described as:

Similarly, one can define the maternal transmission status X
k
(t). Assuming that there is only one disease locus at t0 in the region framed by these M markers, the expectation of the transmission status [4] is

where d(t, t0) = Pr{H(t)|H(t0)} - Pr{H(t)|h(t0)}, a measure for linkage disequilibrium and Î¸ is the recombination fraction. We further assume that there is no imprinting in this dataset, that is, E {X(t)} = E{Y(t)}. Denote C = E{Y(t0)|Î¦ = 1}. One can see that the value of C is determined by the penetrance function and the allele frequencies of disease locus t0 [4]. Under the assumptions of initial complete LD, random mating, and constant Pr{H(t0)} over time, d(t, t0) can be expressed as [5]. Here N is the number of generations since the introduction of a disease-causing mutation at location t0. The parameters of interest in the mean function Î¼(t, t0) are C for penetrance, N for the number of generations, and t0 the location of disease locus. Because Y(t) and X(t) are potentially correlated over M markers, Liang et al. [4] proposed a generalized estimating equation approach to estimate these parameters. An appealing feature of this approach is that the derived parameter estimates remain valid as long as Î¼(t, t0) is correctly specified. Liang et al. [4] also proposed to test the null hypothesis of no linkage or LD to the region framed by the observed M markers by testing C = 0. The test statistic is based on a Wald-type statistic, that is, , requiring a simultaneous estimation of (t0, N, C) under the assumption that there is a disease locus in the region. However, this approach has several limitations: 1) t0 is unidentifiable under the null hypothesis; 2) there is a lack of robustness ifthe assumption of constant Pr{H(t0)} over time is not met; and 3) in testing C = 0, one would still need to estimate all parameters.With this consideration we propose to derive a score test statistic for testing C = 0 at locus t0, that is, t0 is not a disease locus. Based on Equation 10 in Liang et al. [4], a test statistic can be derived as

where and superscript T indicates the transpose. Under the independence working assumption among M marker loci, the test statistic can be further simplified to

One could insert  for d(t
m
, t0), but it would require a good estimate of N as well as the probability of h(t
m
) conditional on h(t0). Instead of estimating d(t
m
, t0) under a population genetic model, which is often unverifiable, an empirical estimate can be used to quantify the concordance between the two marker loci in the affected offspring. Devlin and Risch [5] provided a comparison of various measures for estimating the LD. Upon a close examination the weight in Equation (1) essentially determines how close marker locus t
m
is to locus t0. In other words, if marker locus t
m
is closer to locus t0, it is expected that the transmission status at t
m
would contribute more information to the test statistic at t0. It then seems logical that one should estimate directly the concordance of the transmission status at locus t
m
and at locus t0. Since both X(t) and Y(t) take discrete values, a natural measure for concordance is the kappa statistic, which is defined as the ratio of the difference between the probabilities of expected and observed disagreements to the probability of expected disagreement. Here, the disagreement between the two marker loci would be the probability of one marker locus transmitting the rare allele, h, whereas the other marker has transmitted the common allele, H. Specifically, let Z
k
(t) take value -1 if X
k
(t)+Y
k
(t) is negative, i.e., either both parents transmitting h allele but not H, or one parent transmitting h allele but not H and the other parent is non-informative. Similarly, Z
k
(t) takes value 1 if X
k
(t)+Y
k
(t) is positive. Then one can form a 2 Ã 2 table for Z(t
m
) and Z(t0) at loci t
m
and t0 as follows

Define 

Then A nice feature of kappa is that the proportion of agreements is calculated after excluding chance agreement. The value of kappa statistic ranges from -1 (negative complete linkage disequilibrium) to 1 (positive complete linkage disequilibrium). Clearly, each term in the sum of Equation (1) remains unchanged if the allele designation, H versus h, is switched.It is easy to generalize the test statistic T2 in a couple of ways. For example, rather than summing over the total M markers in the test statistic, one can also use the markers within a prespecified neighborhood of t0. In addition, the test statistic T2 can be extended to accommodate multiple affected siblings. The following statistic describes these extensions:

where n
k
is the number of affected in the kth family and B is a pre-specified neighborhood around marker locus t0. We name test statistic T as the locally weighted TDT. The choice of the size of a neighborhood depends on many factors such as the nature of the disease mutation and population under study and the marker density. An examination of inter-marker linkage disequilibrium may help determine the window size. By the central limit theorem, K-1/2T is asymptotically normal with a variance that can be empirically estimated by . To account for the multiple comparisons in the tests, one may combine test statistics of all the markers by taking the maximum and determine its critical values by a simulation-based procedure in that the transmission status for each affected offspring are randomly assigned for a large number of times.","The data that we analyzed in this paper consisted of all affected offspring and their parents from the first replicate of Aipotu study. There were a total of 100 nuclear families with 283 affected offspring. We had no knowledge of the ""answers"" at the time when we performed the following analyses.We performed a single-point linkage analysis using the microsatellite markers genotyped on the affected sibpairs (see the companion paper by Houwing-Duistermaat et al. [6]). The microsatellite markers were on average about 7.5 cM apart. We found that the LOD scores for marker D3S0124 and D3S0127 on chromosome 3 were 4.51 and 3.06, respectively. Both exceeded the cut-off threshold of LOD score 3 for IBD testing. Marker D3S0124 was even beyond 3.6, a critical value suggested by Lander and Kruglyak [7] for genome-wide significance. Based on these results, we subsequently purchased 7 packets of basic SNP markers in this region flanked by microsatellite markers D3S0123 and D3S0127. This covers all available SNP markers for the telomere end of chromosome 3. Excluding the microsatellite markers, there were a total of 134 SNP markers covering about 35 cM in genetic distance.We applied our proposed test statistics to these 134 SNP markers using all affected-parent trios. We used 2 markers on each side as a pre-determined neighborhood within which the marker contributions to the test statistic are considered. Figure 1 shows the Ï2 values for the TDT (left panel) and locally weighted TDT (right panel). The lower two plots are the enlarged plots for the 10 markers toward the telomere, some of which showed significant associations with the disease occurrence. The critical values corresponding to level 0.05, indicated by the horizontal lines in the plots, were obtained from the permutation procedure described in ""Methods."" They were 11.2 and 11.0 for the TDT and locally weighted TDT test statistics, respectively. SNP marker B03T3056 was the only marker that exceeded the threshold for the TDT. Using the locally weighted test statistic both markers B03T3056 and B03T3057 showed significant associations with the disease occurrence in the affected offspring. We have also analyzed the data using larger size windows up to all markers. Although the peak at marker B03T3056 remains significant for all window sizes, the magnitude of the peak decreases with increasing window size (results not shown). Further examination of the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) using HAPLOVIEW (Mark Daly's laboratory, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) indicated an overall very weak inter-marker LD with exception for marker B03T3056 and B03T3057. The LD measure D' between these two markers is 0.60 and the 95% confidence interval is (0.53, 0.67).Figure 1Ï2 for TDT (left) and smoothed TDT (right).Full size imageTo study whether SNP B03T3056 and B03T3057 partly explain the linkage peaks at microsatellite markers D3S0124 and D3S0127, we then included SNP B03T3056 and B03T3057 each and both as covariate(s) in the single-point linkage analysis using the same affected sib pairs as in the initial linkage analysis scan (see Table 1 from Houwing-Duistermaat et al. [6]). The overall LOD score for microsatellite marker D3S0127 and SNP B03T3056 was increased compared to the LOD score for the microsatellite marker only (p = 0.02). But the increase in overall LOD score was fairly minimal when SNP B03T3057 was considered. For microsatellite marker D3S0124, only a moderate improvement was observed in the overall LOD scores after including the SNPs. Based on these results, we postulate that SNP B03T3056 only partially explains the linkage signal at microsatellite markers D3S0124 and D3S0127 and other unknown genes may still be present in the region.","In this paper we proposed a method that accounts for the local dependencies among adjacent markers. We applied it to the simulated dataset and showed that the proposed test statistics yield a smoothed signal between marker B03T3056 and B03T3057. The proposed method did not show much more power than the conventional TDT, in part due to an overall weak inter-marker LD in this SNP dataset (results are not shown). Further work on the performance of the proposed method under a wide range of scenarios will be warranted. The choice of window size in the locally weighted test statistic depends on the nature of the disease mutation and population under study as well as marker density. One possible choice is to first examine an overall LD in the region and use it as guidance for determining the window size. A strong LD suggests a wide window size and vice versa. Another possible choice is to calculate the locally weighted test statistics for a few different window sizes and combine them into one test statistic by taking the maximum. The appropriate critical threshold value needs to be adjusted for such a combinatorial test statistic. In this manuscript, we are testing the null hypothesis C = 0. An alternative may be to construct confidence bands for , turning the testing problem into an estimation one. The region for which the confidence bands do not include 0 is likely an indication for a disease locus. An advantage of such a approach is that it provides a confidence interval for which the disease locus might reside. We will investigate methods for constructing confidence bands in the future."
2,"HLA DR phenotypic frequencies and genetic risk of Type 1 diabetes in west region of Algeria, Tlemcen","The type 1 diabetes, previously called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is the consequence of progressive and selective destruction of pancreatic Î² cells by an immune-mediated process [1], resulting in an absolute lack of insulin [2]. It is well established that this self-destruction is primarily provoked by the activation of the autoreactive T lymphocytes by the production of T-helper 1 cytokines [3, 4]. In addition, the difference of the epidemiological data from one region to another could largely explain why the release of the autoimmunity is stimulated under the influence of one or more environmental factors [5, 6], in genetically predisposed subjects. It is currently obvious that the strongest genetic susceptibility of predisposition is allotted to the IDDM1 alleles located in the HLA locus of the chromosome 6p21 [7â9], and the non-HLA alleles, particularly the IDDM2 polymorph gene located in the region 5' of the insulin gene (INS) promoter situated on the chromosome 11p15 [10, 11]. Other regions of the genome were identified as IDDM3, coding for the IGF1 receptor, IDDM4, located near the fibroblast growth factor 3 gene, IDDM5, near the estrogens receptor gene [7] etc. The majority of these regions have no possible statistical criteria allowing them to be clearly linked to the disease [11]. In all cases, it is mainly HLA alleles that present a high risk of contracting the disease compared to non-HLA alleles [6, 12]. Due to this, they are qualified as high genetic predictive markers of developing type 1 diabetes in families having a type 1 diabetic member. Interestingly, the disease prediction offered with success the possibility of clinical trials to delay, or even prevent the appearance of type 1 diabetes.However, the different HLA types associated with diabetes depend also on the population. The purpose of our study is to measure HLA DR3 and/or DR4 antigen frequencies and their association in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects originating from the west-Algerian region of Tlemcen. Using a case-control retrospective study design, we attempt to determine which is the greatest HLA DR susceptibility contributing to developing type 1 diabetes. Ninety-one (91) eligible subjects (thirty-nine (39) type 1 diabetics and fifty-two (52) nondiabetics with relatives with type 1 diabetes as controls), were recruited at the Internal Medicine Board of the Medical Centre University of Tlemcen.","Table 1 summarizes HLA DR3, DR4 and DR3DR4 antigen frequencies in type 1 diabetics and their nondiabetic relatives.Table 1 HLA DR phenotypic frequencies according to p-values and Odds ratio in type 1 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects.Full size tableDR4 and DR3DR4 antigens showed an association with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (DR4; OR = 2.10, DR3DR4; OR = 1.30, that is respectively OR confidence interval 1.04â4.24 and 0.60â2.80, 95% CI), in contrast, DR3 antigens showed no association with the disease (OR = 0.95, OR confidence interval 0.48â1.87, 95% CI). It is important to notice that the strongest association is found in DR4 phenotype as indicated in Figure 1.Figure 1HLA DR antigen associations with type 1 diabetes. The block boxes represent the odds ratios (OR). The horizontal lines represent the lower and upper confidence limit of OR (confidence interval, 95 % CI).Full size imageIn addition, the phenotypic frequency of DR4 or DR3DR4 molecules is higher in diabetic group than in the control one, although the difference did not reach significance level in DR3DR4 frequencies (p = 0.0361 and p = 0.5887 respectively). On the contrary, the DR3 molecules frequency is slightly decreased in type 1 diabetic patients compared to the controls and presents no statistically significant difference (p = 1.000). Furthermore, no incidence was related to the sex criteria for the frequencies of DR3 and DR3DR4 molecules (p > 0.05). However, significant differences in HLA DR4 frequencies are linked to the female sex and present a value definitely higher in type 1 diabetic patients compared to those of nondiabetics for the same sex (p < 0.05) (Figure 2).Figure 2HLA DR antigen frequencies compared to the sex ratio. * p < 0.05, Type 1 diabetics vs. control subjects.Full size image","Type 1 diabetes is a polygenic disease which results from the interaction between environmental (viral, toxic, nutritional, socioeconomic [6]) and genetic factors. It is the form of diabetes which occurs mainly in children and young adults [13].Fortunately, molecular epidemiology offers the hope of the possibility of preventing the disease in the future, by evaluating the potential factors of risk of developing this pathology [6]. Although almost 90 % of new cases of type 1 diabetes occur sporadically, studies of individuals with a diabetic relative in their family are essential [4].It is well established that associations between type 1 diabetes and certain HLA antigens largely facilitate the identification of the subjects having a potential risk to develop the disease. Among the putative HLA molecules known to confer a high susceptibility are DQA1 (*0301)-DQB1 (*0302) (= DQ8), DQA1 (*0501)-DQB1 (*0201) (= DQ2), DRA-DRB1 (*0401) (= DR4) and DRA-DRB1 (*0301) (= DR3) [14]. However, epidemiological studies showed that the different HLA types associated with the diabetes depend also on the various populations. For instance, the risk of developing type 1 diabetes in Caucasians is greater if they are carrying the HLA A8 and B15, while DQ6 alleles are protectors [11, 14, 15]. Among Japanese, it is the association with the HLA B54 that confers a higher susceptibility to develop the disease, while the strongest association was found with HLA DR and HLA DQ locus [11].In Algeria, and especially in its western region (Tlemcen), which is known for its history of consanguineous marriage, there is a high rate of consanguinity. This fact could increase the risk of developing type 1 diabetes by favouring the transmission of HLA haplotypes and recessive genes of susceptibility except for HLA antigens that are common in both parents. For these reasons, we were interested in checking whether phenotypically DR3DR4 antigens would involve less risk to develop the disease, in comparison with DR3 or DR4 antigens, knowing the fact that the presence of a probable consanguinity could reduce the frequency of DR3DR4 polymorph phenotype compared to that of DR3 or DR4 phenotype.On a purely comparative basis, similarities seem to be found between our results and those of other investigators [5, 13, 15] with regards to HLA DR4 or DR3DR4 frequencies, which are higher in the type 1 diabetic than the nondiabetic population. On the contrary, the HLA DR3 antigens showed comparable frequencies in both groups of our sample. Consequently, these observations associating DR3 phenotype to a protector effect against type 1 diabetes in our studied population are thus do not conform with those reported in the literature [15â18]. However, DR4 and DR3DR4 antigens are obviously associated with susceptibility of developing the disease. It should also be noted that DR3DR4 antigens might represent a weaker predictive value of disease risk. We concluded from this that the non-excess of DR3DR4 antigens, or comparable frequencies of DR3 molecules between type 1 diabetic patients and ND relative controls, might be a strong indices of consanguinity in our sample. A recent study carried out in Sweden showed that HLA DR3 is associated to the development of type 1 diabetes and the incompatibility of blood group ABo [19]. One can thus note that the role of the HLA DR3 antigens in conferring risk for type 1 diabetes can be masked in the homogeneous populations. Due to the restricted size of our sample, which may influence our interpretation, we should not consider the odds ratio of HLA DR3 antigens or the eventual consanguinity of our studied population. Moreover, many evidences [20â23] incriminate DR3 and/or DR4 antigens in the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes and their association with the detected autoantibodies in this disease. Indeed, the marks of autoimmunity are much more observed in the diabetic patients carrying DR3 or DR4 antigens than in the diabetic patients where DR3 or DR4 antigens were absents [13]. Furthermore, recent research indicates that a subject with HLA DR4 or DR3 alleles has three or four times more chance of developing type 1 diabetes compared to the general population; DR3DR4 is associated with the highest risk (20 to 40 times more) [11].In Algeria, very few investigations have been undertaken to study the impact of the genetic background on the risk to develop type 1 diabetes in its population, where an annual average incidence of 4.7 per 100000 has already been listed [24]. In a similar study carried out on Algerian unrelated type 1 diabetics (n = 50) and nondiabetics controls (n = 46), the presence of DR3-DQ2 (linkage disequilibrium) in 45 % of patients and in 13 % of controls was detected by molecular genotyping method using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and SSO (sequence specific oligonucleotide). DR4-DQ8 was found in 37 % of diabetic cases and in 4 % of control groups [25]. Finally, association with type 1 diabetes attributed to DR-B1*0405 (alleles of DR4 antigens expression) susceptibility showed a match with our results; however, the DR4 antigens were found to be linked to the female sex. According to the results showed in Table 1, there is no difference between men and women patients with type 1 diabetes carrying DR4 antigens, but a significant difference was noticed in female sex, either women were contracted or not with diabetic disease.It is certain that screening of HLA class II sub-types and determination of DNA coding sequences allows more precise characterization of ethnic groups, especially, because the same coded molecules can differ by the position of few amino acids. For example, it is well established that DQA1 and DQB1 alleles (sub-types of HLA DQ) code respectively for the alpha and beta chain of the DQ molecule [6]. Thus, the combination of DQ alpha with Arg in position 52 (Arg-52) and DQ beta in position 57 without Asp (non-Asp 57) is called a diabetogenic heterodimer which is the biggest risk factor of type 1 diabetes in Caucasian. Nevertheless, among the Japanese population, type 1 diabetes is particularly associated with HLA DQ alpha Arg-52, but not with HLA DQ beta non-Asp 57 [5].Moreover, it is true that the search of an association with a candidate gene allows a better characterization for most of the frequent multifactorial diseases, because the candidate genes are directly implied in the pathological processes. Today, it is reported that the CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) allele, localised on the chromosome 2p33, former IDDM12, is largely associated with the susceptibility of numerous common complex diseases, such as the common autoimmune disorders Graves' disease, the autoimmune hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes [26]. Combined, these pertinent observations still open new perspectives for debating this crucial subject concerning the public health.","Type 1 diabetes, or youth diabetes, is a multifactorial disease occurring on a genetic ground of predisposition and starts under certain environmental conditions. The most effective preventive strategy must be designed at the pre-diabetes stage, since immune and/or genetic markers can easily indicate subjects with high risk before the clinical symptoms. Thus, the genetic analysis of HLA class II associations has allowed a screening of the contributing molecules to the type 1 diabetes development and the selection of subjects, which are likely to contract the disease.In this study, we were confronted with difficulties in interpretation of our results which are mainly due to the presence of some indices of consanguinity in our studied population, showing a non excess of DR3DR4 phenotype compared to the DR3 or DR4 phenotype, and a no link of DR3 phenotype to the disease. This result could be due to an ethnic characteristic of Tlemcen population, a history of consanguineous marriages. Nevertheless, these preliminary results made it possible to answer the asked questions. Thus, the strongest type 1 diabetes association is statistically revealed with phenotypic expression of DR4 followed by DR3DR4 phenotype. Association studies between the disease and genetic polymorphisms should be carried out on the population having more limited consanguinity to reduce confusions in result interpretations."
