0,Search for genetic variants in the p66Shc longevity gene by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism in patients with early-onset cardiovascular disease,"Increasing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may participate in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cardiovascular disorders. Support to this comes from the experimental demonstration that vessel walls of patients with atherosclerotic risk factors are characterized by a significant increase in vascular ROS production [1].It has been reported that the p66Shc longevity gene increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby affecting the rate of oxidative damage to nucleic acids [2]. The human Shc locus (Src homologous and collagen) encodes three proteins with relative molecular masses of 46K (p46Shc), 52K (p52Shc) and 66K (p66Shc). All three proteins share a Src-homology2 (SH2) domain, a collagen-homology (CH1) region and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. The p66Shc protein contains a unique amino terminal region (CH2) [3]. p46Shc, p52Shc and p66Shc are adaptor proteins in the insulin-signalling pathway, but their downstream effects differ: p46Shc and p52Shc are tyrosine-phosphorylated by a variety of growth factors, and are associated with MAPK signalling; p66Shc also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to extracellular signals but is involved in signal transduction pathways that inhibits the activation of c-fos promoter [4]. C-fos is transcriptionally activated in response to environmental stresses such as ultraviolet light (UV) or H2O2. Thus, there is in vitro evidence that p66Shc is part of a complex transduction pathway that controls oxidative stress [4].Knock out mice for the p66Shc gene locus show a higher resistance to oxidative stress and extended life span (up to 30%) [3]. Moreover, p66Shc-/- cells show a reduced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, which is restored by p66Shc over expression [3].Also, the role of p66Shc in muscle damage that follows acute hindlimb ischemia has been investigated. Results showed that p66Shc-/- mice were resistant to tissue damage induced by ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion secondary to ROS generation, demonstrating that p66Shc plays a crucial role in the cell death pathways activated by acute ischemia [5].Further studies using p66Shc-/- mice showed a significant reduction of systemic oxidative stress, plasma LDL oxidation and early atherosclerotic lesions when mice were fed a high-fat diet [6].p66Shc expression is tissue specific [7] and it is regulated by epigenetic modifications, namely histone deacetylation and cytosine methylation. In this regard, it has been reported that histone deacetylase inhibitors and demethylating agents restore p66Shc expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) that normally do not express this isoform [8].More recent studies have observed that absence of p66Shc expression might contribute to the protection of the heart from the deleterious effects of elevated Angiotensis II levels [9]. Furthermore, it was reported that inactivation of the p66Shc gene protects against age-dependent ROS-mediated endothelial dysfunction [10] in p66Shc KO mice.It appears therefore that p66Shc may play a pivotal role in controlling oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in vivo, possibly regulating the evolution of the atherosclerotic process. Based on this background, we investigated the p66Shc specific region of the Shc gene and its upstream promoter for variations in a selected group of subjects with early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD).","The possible effect of p66Shc longevity gene mutations on CAD would probably determine an early onset of the disease, and assuming that a genetic effect might be more evident in younger patients, we choose to select subjects with age of diagnosis of CAD <55 years. This age limit was based on the incidence curves of CAD and the estimates of genetic effect at various ages [11, 12]. As controls we studied 93 unrelated long-living subjects (mean age 89 ± 6 years) randomly selected from a population of individuals screened for CAD risk factors.The human Shc locus encodes three proteins (p46, p52 and p66) by using two alternative promoters that synthesize two mRNAs coding for p46/p52 and for p66 [8]. The p66Shc promoter, positioned in the first intron of the Shc locus, contains a relative high frequency of CpG dinucleotides whose methylation regulates the transcriptional activity of p66Shc promoter [8]. Considering the recent observations that alterations in expression of p66Shc gene might be one possible cause in determining life span and in controlling oxidative stress, we hypothesised that sequence variations in p66Shc promoter may contribute to both aging and early atherogenesis. PCR-SSCP analysis of the p66 specific region of the Shc locus and the p66Shc promoter (from nucleotide -637) revealed two variant bands (Figure 1). Sequencing of these variants showed two SNPs: -354T>C in the regulatory region of p66Shc locus and 92C>T in the p66 specific region (CH2). The first substitution partially modifies the binding consensus sequence of the Sp1 transcription factor, and was detected only in two heterozygous carriers (1 CAD subject and 1 control subject). The 92C>T substitution in the CH2 region consists in an amino acid substitution at codon 31 in which proline is substituted with leucine (P31L), and was detected in heterozygous status only in one CAD subject. No subjects homozygous for the two newly described SNPs were found. One family member of the subject carrying the P31L mutation, also affected by early-onset CAD (the brother, age 37 years), was screened for these new polymorphisms, but no SNPs were detected.Figure 1Mutation detection with SSCP and sequence electropherograms of p66Shc.

In the sequence electropherograms, arrows indicate the nucleotide substitution in heterozygous subjects as shown by the presence of the 2 superimposed peaks representing the normal and abnormal base.

B) SSCP analysis of the CH2 region: the 92C>T substitution consisted in an amino acid substitution P31L (C/C subjects with wild-type sequence, C/T subject heterozygous for the variant).Full size image","We screened for new DNA polymorphisms the p66 specific region of the Shc locus (CH2) and the p66Shc promoter. We identified by PCR-SSCP assay of 1167 base pairs in 4 amplified segments two segregating sites in 2 out of the 342 chromosomes examined. The two novel variants (-354T>C and 92C>T) were very rare in both populations of CAD and elderly subjects. Furthermore, no subject homozygous for the two SNPs was found.Our observations agree with a previous study performed in a sample of extreme survivors of the Leiden 85-plus Study, where no sequence variations in the p66 specific region of the Shc gene were found [13].The Shc gene contains one known non-synonymous polymorphism located in the CH1 domain which corresponds to Met300Val in the p52 isoform and to Met410Val in the p66 isoform [13]. No association of the Met300Val (the p52 isoform) variation was found with birth weight and length, impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a cohort of 360 young healthy Danish Caucasian subjects [14]. In a more recent study the Met410Val variant (the p66 isoform) was tested for association with longevity using a prospective follow-up design in two independent cohorts of 730 and 563 subjects aged 85 and over [13]. Mooijaart and co-workers observed a small increase in Val allele with increasing age of death and a decreased mortality risk of Met/Val carriers compared to Met/Met carriers; however no statistical significance was reached in the two different analyses [13]. These results suggest a possible beneficial effect of the Valine allele on longevity, but no subject homozygous for valine was found and the frequency of this allele was very low in this cohort. To date, no functional studies on the Met/Val variant of the p66Shc isoform have been performed.Finally, this Met/Val amino acid variant is present in all 3 isoform of the Shc gene, thus suggesting that this polymorphism is unlikely to specifically affect the function of p66Shc and not of p46Shc and p52Shc. For all these reasons we did not study the Met/Val variant in our cohorts, since we were looking for variants that would affect particularly the p66Shc gene.","Longevity is a complex trait, resulting from the interaction between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Before our, several studies in long-lived subjects have highlighted the role of biological factors as determinant of 'successful ageing'. For example associations between successful ageing and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) gene polymorphisms have been reported in centenarian [15–17]. However, confirmatory data is needed, and probably several other genetic factors are involved.In our study we had hypothesised that the p66Shc gene may play a pivotal role in controlling oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in vivo, possibly regulating the evolution of the atherosclerotic process. In view of its association with CAD in animal models, we assumed that sequence variations would be less frequent in elderly survivors compared to younger CAD subjects.We screened for new DNA polymorphisms the p66 specific region of the Shc locus (CH2) and the p66Shc promoter and identified two very rare novel variants with no subject homozygous for these SNPs.Our observations agree with a previous study where no sequence variations in the p66 specific region of the Shc gene were found [13]. In the rest of the Shc gene, only one nucleotide substitution (Met/Val) has been reported, located in the CH1 domain and common to all three isoforms of the Shc gene [13, 14]. These observations, together with our data, suggest that important variations in the Shc gene may not be tolerated and that evolution might have selected against their occurrence, and it appears that the role of p66Shc gene in mammalian longevity is probably more complex than previously thought."
1,Approaches for establishing the function of regulatory genetic variants involved in disease,"Regulatory genetic variation is important in human disease. The application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to common multifactorial human traits has revealed that most associations arise in non-coding DNA and implicate regulatory variants that modulate gene expression [1]. Gene expression occurs in a dynamic functional epigenomic landscape in which the majority of genomic sequence is proposed to have regulatory potential [2]. Inter-individual variation in gene expression has been found to be heritable and can be mapped as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) [3],[4]. Such mapping studies reveal that genetic associations with gene expression are common, that they often have large effect sizes, and that regulatory variants act locally and at a distance to modulate a range of regulatory epigenetic processes, often in a highly context-specific manner [5]. Indeed, the mode of action of such regulatory variants is very diverse, reflecting the complexity of mechanisms regulating gene expression and their modulation by environmental factors at the cell, tissue or whole-organism level.Identifying regulatory variants and establishing their function is of significant current research interest as we seek to use GWAS for drug discovery and clinical benefit [6],[7]. GWAS have identified pathways and molecules that were not previously thought to be involved in disease processes and that are potential therapeutic targets [8],[9]. However, for the majority of associations, the identity of the genes involved and their mechanism of action remain unknown, which limits the utility of GWAS. An integrated approach is needed, taking advantage of new genomic tools to understand the chromatin landscape, interactions and allele-specific events, and reveal detailed molecular mechanisms.Here I review approaches to understanding regulatory variation, from the viewpoint of both researchers needing to identify and establish the function of variants underlying a particular disease association, and those seeking to define the extent of regulatory variants and their mechanism of action at a genome-wide scale. I describe the importance of understanding context-specificity in resolving regulatory variants, including defining the disease-relevant epigenomic landscape in which variants operate, to enable functional annotation. I highlight the utility of eQTL studies for linking variants with altered expression of genes and the experimental approaches for establishing function, including descriptions of recent techniques that can help. I provide a strategic view, illustrated by examples from human disease, that is relevant to variants occurring at any genomic location, whether in classical enhancer elements or other locations where there is the potential to modulate gene regulation.","Regulatory variation most commonly involves single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) but also encompasses a range of larger structural genomic variants that can affect gene expression, including copy number variation [10]. Gene regulation is a dynamic, combinatorial process involving a variety of elements and mechanisms that may only operate in particular cell types, at a given stage in development or in response to environmental factors [11],[12]. Various events that are critical to gene expression are modulated by genetic variation: transcription factor binding affinity at enhancer or promoter elements; disruption of chromatin interactions; the action of microRNAs or chromatin regulators; alternative splicing; and post-translational modifications [13],[14]. Classical epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation, chromatin state or accessibility can be modulated directly or indirectly by variants [15]-[18]. Changes in transcription factor binding related to sequence variants are thought to be a principal driver of changes in histone modifications, enhancer choice and gene expression [17]-[19].Functional variants can occur at both genic and intergenic sites, with consequences that include both up- and down-regulation of expression, differences in the kinetics of response or altered specificity. The effect of regulatory variants depends on the sequences that they modulate (for example, promoter or enhancer elements, or encoded regulatory RNAs) and the functional regulatory epigenomic landscape in which they occur. This makes regulatory variants particularly challenging to resolve, as this landscape is typically dynamic and context specific. Defining which sequences are modulated by variants has been facilitated by several approaches: analysis of signatures of evolutionary selection and sequence conservation; experimental identification of regulatory elements; and epigenomic profiling in model organisms, and more recently in humans, for diverse cell and tissue types and conditions [15],[20].The understanding of the consequences of genetic variation for gene expression provides a more tractable intermediate molecular phenotype than a whole-organism phenotype, where confounding by other factors increases heterogeneity. This more direct relationship with underlying genetic diversity might account in part for the success of approaches resolving association with transcription of sequence variants, such as eQTL mapping [3],[5].","The heritable contribution to common polygenic disease remains challenging to resolve, but GWAS have now mapped many loci with high statistical confidence. Over 90% of trait-associated variants are found to be located in non-coding DNA, and they are significantly enriched in chromatin regulatory features, notably DNase I hypersensitive sites [21]. Moreover, there is significant overrepresentation of GWAS variants in eQTL studies, implicating regulatory variants in a broad spectrum of common diseases [7].Several studies have identified functional variants involving enhancer elements and altered transcription factor binding. These include a GWAS variant associated with renal cell carcinoma that results in impaired binding and function of hypoxia inducible factor at a novel enhancer of CCND1[22]; a common variant associated with fetal hemoglobin levels in an erythroid-specific enhancer [23]; and germline variants associated with prostate and colorectal cancer that modulate transcription factor binding at enhancer elements involving looping and long-range interactions with SOX9[24] and MYC[25], respectively. Multiple variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) identified by GWAS can exert functional effects through various different enhancers, resulting in cooperative effects on gene expression [26].Functional variants in promoters have also been identified that are associated with disease. These include the extreme situation in which a gain-of-function regulatory SNV created a new promoter-like element that recruits GATA1 and interferes with expression of downstream α-globin-like genes, resulting in α-thalassemia [27]. Other examples include a Crohn's-disease-associated variant in the 3' untranslated region of IRGM that alters binding by the microRNA mir-196, enhancing mRNA transcript stability and altering the efficacy of autophagy, thus affecting the anti-bacterial activity of intestinal epithelial cells [28]. Some SNVs show significant association with differences in alternative splicing [29], which may be important for disease, as illustrated by a variant of TNFRSF1A associated with multiple sclerosis, which encodes a novel form of TNFR1 that can block tumor necrosis factor [30]. Disease-associated SNVs can also modulate DNA methylation resulting in gene silencing, as illustrated by a variant in a CpG island associated with increased methylation of the HNF1B promoter [31].To identify functional variants, fine mapping of GWAS signals is vital. This can be achieved by using large sample sizes, incorporating imputation or sequence-level information, and involving diverse populations to maximize statistical confidence and resolve LD structure. Interrogation of available functional genomic datasets to enable functional annotation of identified variants and association with genes based on eQTL mapping is an important early step in prioritization and hypothesis generation. However, such analysis must take note of what is known of the pathophysiology of the disease, because the most appropriate cell or tissue type needs to be considered given the context-specificity of gene regulation and functional variants. Two case studies (Box 1) illustrate many of the different approaches that can be used to investigate the role of regulatory variants in loci identified by GWAS. These provide context for a more detailed discussion of techniques and approaches in the remainder of this review.","This section describes approaches and tools for functional annotation of variants, considering in particular the usefulness of resolving the context-specific regulatory epigenomic landscape and of mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait of transcription, protein or metabolites.Functional annotation and the regulatory epigenomic landscapeHigh-resolution epigenomic profiling at genome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has enabled annotation of the regulatory landscape in which genetic variants are found and may act. This includes mapping regulatory features based on:

chromatin accessibility using DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase-seq) mapping [32],[33] and post-translational histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with HTS (ChIP-seq) [34] that indicate the location of regulatory elements such as enhancers;


chromatin conformation capture (3C), which can be scaled using HTS to enable mapping of genome-wide interactions for all loci (Hi-C) [35] or for selected target regions (Capture-C) [36];
targeted arrays or genome-wide HTS to define differential DNA methylation [15]; the non-coding transcriptome using RNA-seq to resolve short and long non-coding RNAs with diverse roles in gene regulation [37] that may be modulated by underlying genetic variation with consequences for common disease [38].


The ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project [2] has generated epigenomic maps for diverse human cell and tissue types, including chromatin state, transcriptional regulator binding and RNA transcripts, that have helped to identify and interpret functional DNA elements [20] and regulatory variants [1],[39]. Enhancers, promoters, silencers, insulators and other regulatory elements can be context specific; this means that generating datasets for particular cellular states and conditions of activation of pathophysiological relevance will be necessary if we are to use such data to inform our understanding of disease. There is also a need to increase the amount of data generated from primary cells given the caveats inherent to immortalized or cancer cell lines. For example, although studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been highly informative [40], their immortalization using the Epstein-Barr virus may alter epigenetic regulation or specific human genes, notably DNA methylation, and observed levels of gene expression, affecting the interpretation of the effects of variants [41],[42]. As part of ongoing efforts to expand the diversity of primary cell types and tissues for which epigenomic maps are available, the International Human Epigenome Consortium, which includes the NIH Roadmap Epigenetics Project [43] and BLUEPRINT [44], seeks to establish 1,000 reference epigenomes for diverse human cell types.The FANTOM5 project (for `functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5') has recently published work complementing and extending ENCODE by using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) and single-molecule sequencing to define comprehensive atlases of transcripts, transcription factors, promoters, enhancers and transcriptional regulatory networks [45],[46]. This includes high-resolution context-specific maps of transcriptional start sites and their usage for 432 different primary cell types, 135 tissues and 241 cell lines, enabling promoter-level characterization of gene expression [46]. The enhancer atlas generated by FANTOM5 defines a map of active enhancers that are transcribed in vivo in diverse cell types and tissues [45]. It builds on the recognition that enhancers can initiate RNA polymerase II transcription to produce eRNAs (short, unspliced, nuclear non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs) and act to regulate context-specific expression of protein-coding genes [45]. Enhancers defined by FANTOM5 were enriched for GWAS variants; the context specificity is exemplified by the fact that GWAS variants for Graves' disease were enriched predominantly in enhancers expressed in thyroid tissue [45].Publicly accessible data available through genome browsers significantly enhances the utility to investigators of ENCODE, FANTOM5 and other datasets that allow functional annotation and interpretation of regulatory variants, while tools integrating datasets in a searchable format further enable hypothesis generation and identification of putative regulatory variants (Table 1) [39],[47],[48]. The UCSC Genome Browser, for example, includes a Variant Annotation Integrator [49], and the Ensembl genome browser includes the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor [50]. The searchable RegulomeDB database enables annotations for particular variants to be accessed. RegulomeDB combines data from ENCODE and other datasets, including manually curated genomic regions for which there is experimental evidence of functionality; chromatin state data; ChIP-seq data for regulatory factors; eQTL data; and computational prediction of transcription factor binding and motif disruption by variants [39]. Kircher and colleagues [47] recently published a Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion method involving 63 types of genomic annotation to establish genome-wide likelihoods of deleteriousness for SNVs and small insertion-deletions (indels), which helps to prioritize functional variants.Table 1

Determining which variants are located in regulatory regions is further helped by analysis of conservation of DNA sequences across species (phylogenetic conservation) to define functional elements. Lunter and colleagues [51] recently reported that 8.2% of the human genome is subject to negative selection and is likely to be functional. Claussnitzer and colleagues [52] studied conservation of transcription factor binding sites in cis-regulatory modules. They found that the regulation involving such sequences was combinatorial and depended on complex patterns of co-occurring binding sites [52]. Application of their `phylogenic module complexity analysis' approach to type 2 diabetes GWAS loci revealed a functional variant in the PPARG gene locus that altered binding of the homeodomain transcription factor PRRX1. This was experimentally validated using allele-specific approaches and effects on lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis were demonstrated.Insights from transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome QTLsMapping gene expression as a quantitative trait is a powerful way to define the regions and markers associated with differential expression between individuals [53]. Application in human populations has enabled insights into the genomic landscape of regulatory variants, generating maps that are useful for GWAS, sequencing studies and other settings where the function of genetic variants is sought [5],[7],[54]. Local variants are likely to be cis-acting and those at a distance are likely to be trans-acting. Resolution of trans-eQTLs is challenging, requiring large sample sizes owing to the number of comparisons performed, because all genotyped variants in the genome can be considered for association. However, this resolution is important given how informative eQTLs can be for defining networks, pathways and disease mechanism [55]. When combined with cis-eQTL mapping, trans-eQTL analysis allows discovery of previously unappreciated relationships between genes, as a variant showing local cis association with expression of a gene might also be found to show trans association with one or more other genes (Figure 1). For example, in the case of a cis-eQTL involving a transcription factor gene, these trans-associated genes might be regulated by that transcription factor (Figure 1c). This can be very informative when investigating loci found in GWAS; for example, a cis-eQTL for the transcription factor KLF14 that is also associated with type 2 diabetes and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was found to act as a master trans regulator of adipose gene expression [56]. Trans-eQTL analysis is also a complementary method to ChIP-seq for defining transcription factor target genes [57]. For other cis-eQTLs, the trans-associated genes might be part of a signaling cascade (Figure 1d), which might be well annotated (for example a cis-eQTL involving IFNB1 is associated in trans with a downstream cytokine network) or provide new biological insights [57].Figure 1
Examples of local and distant effects of regulatory variants. (a) A local cis-acting variant (red star, top) in a regulatory element (red line) affects allele-specific transcription factor binding affinity and is associated with differential expression of gene A (as shown by the chart, bottom), with possession of a copy of the A allele associated with higher expression than the G allele (hence AA homozygotes having higher expression than AG heterozygotes, with lowest expression in GG homozygotes). (b) The same variant can modulate expression of gene D at a distance through DNA looping that brings the regulatory enhancer element close to the promoter of gene D (gray line) on the same chromosome. (c) An example of a local cis-acting variant modulating expression of a transcription factor encoding gene, Gene E, differential expression of which modulates a set of target genes. Expression of these target genes is found to be associated in trans with the variant upstream of gene E. (d) A local cis-acting variant on chromosome 12 modulates expression of a cytokine gene and is also associated in trans with a set of genes whose expression is regulated through a signaling cascade determined by that cytokine. Such trans associations can be shown on a circos plot (chromosomes labeled 1-22 with arrows pointing to location of gene on a given chromosome).Full size image
eQTLs are typically context specific, dependent for example on cell type [58]-[60] and state of cellular activation [57],[61],[62]. Careful consideration of relevant cell types and conditions is therefore needed when investigating regulatory variants for particular disease states. For example, eQTL analysis of the innate immune response transcriptome in monocytes defined associations involving canonical signaling pathways, key components of the inflammasome, downstream cytokines and receptors [57]. In many cases these were disease-associated variants and were identified only in induced monocytes, generating hypotheses for the mechanism of action of reported GWAS variants. Such variants would not have been resolved if only resting cells had been analyzed [57]. Other factors can also be significant modulators of observed eQTLs, including age, gender, population, geography and infection status, and they can provide important insights into gene-environment interactions [62]-[66].The majority of published eQTL studies have quantified gene expression using microarrays. Application of RNA-seq enables high-resolution eQTL mapping, including association with abundance of alternatively spliced transcripts and quantification of allele-specific expression [40],[67]. The latter provides a complementary mapping approach to define regulatory variants.In theory, eQTLs defined at the transcript level might not be reflected at the protein level. However, recent work by Kruglyak and colleagues [68] in large, highly variable yeast populations using green fluorescent protein tags to quantify single-cell protein abundance has shown good correspondence between QTLs influencing mRNA and protein abundance; genomic hotspots were associated with variation in abundance of multiple proteins and modulating networks.Mapping protein abundance as a quantitative trait (pQTL mapping) is important in ongoing efforts to understand regulatory variants and the functional follow-up of GWAS. However, a major limitation has been availability of appropriate high-throughput methods for quantification. A highly multiplexed proteomic platform involving modified aptamers was used to map cis-regulated protein expression in plasma [69], and micro-western and reverse-phase protein arrays enabled 414 proteins to be assayed simultaneously in LCLs, resolving a pQTL involved in the response to chemotherapeutic agents [70]. The application of state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods is enabling quantification of protein abundance for pQTL mapping. There are still limitations, however, in the extent, sensitivity and dynamic range that can be assayed, the availability of analysis tools, and challenges inherent in studying the highly complex and diverse human proteome [71].There are multiple ways in which genetic variation can modulate the nature, abundance and function of proteins, including effects of non-coding variants on transcription, regulation of translation and RNA editing, and alternative splicing. In coding sequences, non-synonymous variants can also affect regulation of splicing and transcript stability. An estimated 15% of codons have been proposed by Stergachis and colleagues [72] to specify both amino acids and transcription factor binding sites; they found evidence that the latter resulted in codon constraint through evolutionary selective pressure, and that coding SNVs directly affected the resultant transcription factor binding. It remains unclear to what extent sequence variants modulate functionally critical post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and sulfation.The role of genetic variation in modulating human blood metabolites was highlighted by a recent large study by Shin and colleagues [73] of 7,824 individuals, in which 529 metabolites in plasma or serum were quantified using liquid-phase chromatography, gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. This identified genome-wide associations at 145 loci. For specific genes, there was evidence of a spectrum of genetic variants ranging from very rare loss-of-function alleles leading to metabolic disorders to common variants associated with molecular intermediate traits and disease. Availability of eQTL data through gene expression profiling at the same time as metabolomic measurements enabled a Mendelian randomization analysis (a method for assessing causal associations in observational data that are based on the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring [74]) to search for a causal relationship between differential expression of a gene and metabolite levels using genetic variation as an instrumental variable. There were limitations due to study power but a causal role for some eQTLs in metabolic trait associations was defined, including for the acyl-CoA thioesterase THEM4 and the cytochrome P450 CYP3A5 genes [73].Finally, analysis of epigenetic phenotypes as quantitative traits has proved very informative. Degner and colleagues [16] analyzed DNase-I hypersensitivity as a quantitative trait (dsQTLs) in LCLs. Many of the observed dsQTLs were found to overlap with known functional regions, show allele-specific transcription factor binding and also show evidence of being eQTLs. Methylation QTL (meQTL) studies have also been published for a variety of cell and tissue types that provide further insight in regulatory functions of genomic variants [75]-[77]. A meQTL study in LCLs revealed significant overlap with other epigenetic marks, including histone modifications and DNase-I hypersensitivity, and also with up- and down-regulation of gene expression [77]. Altered transcription factor binding by variants was found to be a key early step in the regulatory cascade that may result in altered methylation and other epigenetic phenomena [77]."
2,Genetic determinants of metabolism in health and disease: from biochemical genetics to genome-wide associations,"The last few decades have witnessed a radical change in the biological sciences, as the advent of the 'omics' era has brought large-scale measurement of genes [1, 2], transcripts [3], proteins [4, 5] and metabolites [6–8]. Genetics has undergone a high-throughput revolution, with genomic sciences enabling the rapid acquisition of genome-wide gene-expression profiles, polymorphisms and, more recently, whole genome sequences [9]. These advances have been matched by advances in the measurement of small-molecule metabolites in the associated fields of metabonomics [10, 11] and metabolomics [8, 12]. Like genomics, these fields aim for comprehensive measurement and analysis of variations, but in the complement of low-molecular-weight compounds within a cell, tissue or biofluid.For the past 20 years, developments in genomics and metabonomics have progressed on parallel tracks, exchanging experimental designs, data-analysis techniques and applications in basic biology and medicine [13–16]. Yet genes and metabolites are intrinsically co-informational, each shedding light on complementary biological processes. The genome encodes the metabolic capacities of the cell (the microbiome also influences mammalian metabolism), and changes in the activity and function of enzymes, transporters and transcription factors resulting from genetic variations have a direct impact on the identities and quantities of both intracellular and extracellular metabolites. Metabolite concentrations are ultimately quantitative, phenotypic traits, the genetics of which are described by the quantitative trait locus (QTL) - a DNA sequence controlling the phenotypic outcome of the quantitative trait, such as a metabolite concentration. Since the origins of biochemical genetics over a century ago, the integrated study of genetics and metabolism has produced significant advances in the understanding of basic biological processes and in the diagnosis and treatment of human disease [17].Metabolic profiling of single gene mutations [18] and QTL mapping of single metabolic traits [19] both represent early attempts at identifying gene-metabolite associations through omic sciences, by regressing one gene against many metabolites or one metabolite against many genes. In more recent studies, metabolome-wide profiling of biofluids by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (MS) is combined with whole-genome profiling of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify many gene-metabolite associations simultaneously, by regressing many metabolite levels against many polymorphisms [20]. While these studies, termed metabolomic quantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping, or metabolomic genome-wide association studies (mGWAS), are often applied to human genes and human biofluid profiles, these techniques hold the additional promise of investigating interactions between gut microflora genes and biofluid metabolites. By regressing metagenomic sequences against metabolic profiles, metagenome-wide metabolome-wide associations provide insight into the metabolic cross-talk of bacterial and human genomes in the larger human superorganism [21, 22]. This review discusses the highly analogous methods and applications of genomics and metabolomics, as well as recent attempts at integrating the two fields towards a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of gene function and the control of metabolic processes.","Increases in the speed, accuracy and coverage of genomic analysis have been mirrored by technological developments in the large-scale measurement of low-molecular-weight metabolites, using the two major analytical platforms of NMR spectroscopy and MS [23]. While these techniques feature varying strengths in coverage, sensitivity, selectivity for various chemical classes, reproducibility, provision of structural information, and sample-preparation requirements, both stand out in their capacity to measure a large number of small-molecule analytes in an untargeted fashion from complex biological mixtures, such as human biofluids [24].One of the most popular analytical chemistry techniques, NMR spectroscopy has a long history of application in organic chemistry for structural identification and is used extensively in metabonomics. NMR spectroscopy is characterized by the following key properties, which are fit for purpose: (i) high dynamic range, with several biological nuclei, such as 1H, 13C, 15N or 31P, being accurately measured over a large range of concentrations; (ii) high linearity of signal intensity with concentration; and (iii) high reproducibility. In particular, 1H NMR spectroscopy is robust, provides a high degree of structural information for both one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR, and is flexibly applied to extracts, biofluids and solid tissues using high-resolution magic angle spinning, and in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Technological advancements in magnetic field strength with the introduction of 600, 800 and, recently, 1,000 MHz NMR spectrometers, pulse sequence experiments, and cryogenically cooled probes have increased the sensitivity and coverage for small-molecular-weight metabolites and lipid components from urine, plasma, serum and tissue samples [11].MS, coupled to either liquid (LC) or gas (GC) chromatography, is also frequently applied to profile the metabolome [25–27]. LC- and GC-MS both boast high sensitivity to low-concentration analytes, as well as high-resolution chromatographic separation. While these techniques have faced challenges in compound identification, reproducibility and bias towards certain compound functional groups, the rapid pace of technological development in MS has sought to address many of these challenges. Advances in chromatography, including ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and multidimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC, 3D-GC), have increased the speed and reproducibility of chromatography-coupled MS [28]. Additionally, advances in MS, including high-resolution time-of-flight (ToF) and quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) instruments, along with serial ion fragmentation (MS-MS, MSn) have improved resolution, coverage and identification of low-molecular-weight species [29].While many comparisons have been made between the utility of these techniques for metabolite analysis [30], advances in both have paralleled advances in speed, accuracy and coverage in genomics. As a result, broad-coverage metabolite profiling using NMR spectroscopy and MS has been increasingly used to answer the same questions as genomics, especially in the search for risk factors for disease at the population level and predictors of drug metabolism in personalized medicine [13–16]. These are mirrored in parallel developments in experimental design and data analysis.Just as the introduction of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) began the search for associations between genome-wide polymorphisms with disease phenotypes in large population cohorts [15, 31], the metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) has used large numbers of biofluid spectra and statistical regression to search for associations between metabolites present in human biofluids and both quantitative and binary physiological and pathological traits [16]. Two-class experimental designs, in which metabolite associations with disease are identified by statistical regression of metabolic profiles against binary variables for affected and control individuals, are common, and associations between metabolites and disease have been reported for obesity and insulin resistance [32], prostate cancer [33], autism [34], ulcerative colitis [35] and more [36]. However, the recent application of metabolic profiling to large population cohorts, quantitative traits and population differences (termed MWAS) has revealed metabolite associations with diet and blood pressure [37], region and cardiovascular risk [38] and ethnicity [39].In addition to studies of disease risk, both metabolites and genes have been queried to predict drug metabolism. Paralleling previous work in pharmacogenomics, the introduction of pharmaco-metabonomics has demonstrated that drug metabolism can be predicted from the metabolite composition of urinary biofluids before drug administration [13, 40]. Recent applications of pharmaco-metabonomics have highlighted metabolic predictors of acetominophen toxicity in animals [13] and humans [41, 42], capecitabine toxicity [43] and microbial influences on drug detoxification [41].","Since the discovery of alkaptonuria by Archibald Garrod in the early 20th century, the measurement of metabolites has been used as a proxy to identify human genetic diseases, especially inborn errors of metabolism. Uniform newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism, including urea-cycle disorders and amino- and organic-acidurias, using heel-prick testing with GC-MS-MS exemplifies the power of targeted metabolomic analysis to diagnose these diseases and enable the interruption of pathological processes resulting from genetic mutations [44]. More recently, untargeted NMR spectroscopy and MS have been used to diagnose known inborn errors [45–48], identify novel inborn errors using biofluid profiling [49, 50] and identify complex downstream metabolic consequences [51–53] and biomarkers of organ pathology resulting from genetic mutations [54–56].Untargeted metabolic profiling of biofluids, especially urine and serum, is a powerful technique for diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism with often non-specific clinical presentation, as metabolic intermediates accumulated in biofluid compartments can be easily identified [18, 57, 58]. As a result, diagnosis of suspected inborn errors has been reported for many Mendelian diseases [45–50], especially using NMR spectroscopy. In some cases, metabolic profiling of biofluids from patients with suspected inborn errors has led to the discovery of previously undescribed diseases, with the identification of causal genes following the description of metabolic perturbations, as occurred with aminoacylase 1 deficiency and beta-ureidopropionase deficiency [49, 50].While mutations in enzymes and transporters can often be readily diagnosed by biofluid profiling, and a strong mechanistic link is easily inferred between the disruption of a metabolic pathway and resulting accumulation or depletion of metabolic intermediates, many Mendelian diseases result in more complex, progressive organ-specific or multi-organ pathology [59]. In these cases, metabolic profiling has been applied to identify sites of lesions, describe progression and attempt to identify proxy small-molecular biomarkers of the disease. Examples of this include the identification of markers of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [55], comparison of the urinary profiles of several genetic forms of renal Fanconi syndrome [56] and description of abnormal brain metabolism in Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome [54]. Additionally, metabolite flux analysis using isotopically labeled metabolites suggests an additional way to apply metabolic profiling techniques to study the impact of genetic mutations [59].The genomic corollary of using metabolic profiling to study Mendelian genes is QTL mapping of single metabolic traits. The advent of whole-genome SNP analysis and the use of QTL mapping for quantitative traits, such as height [60], led to interest in identifying genetic loci associated with quantitative variation in individual metabolite levels [19]. Examples of this include mapping of serum leptin levels to genes on human chromosome 2 in multiple human populations [61, 62], associations with plasma triglyceride levels [63, 64] and identification of genetic variants associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels [65, 66]. Recent studies have investigated associations between serum lipid fractions and polymorphisms, constituting an intermediate between traditional metabolite QTL mapping and mQTL/mGWAS [67]. Like many QTL mapping studies, attempts to identify loci significantly associated with biofluid levels of single metabolites frequently indicate a large number of genetic associations. This is almost certainly an indication of complex, multigenic control processes regulating energy metabolism and homeostasis, and the identification of large numbers of multiple loci provides an important documentation of genes involved in complex metabolic pathways. However, a large number of loci each contributing to a potentially small percentage of observed variance in metabolite levels complicates direct interpretation of genotype-phenotype relationships in these cases. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of gene-metabolite correlations in biochemical genetics, traditional QTL mapping, and mQTL/mGWAS.Figure 1Three experimental designs integrating genomic and metabolomic analysis. (a) Metabolic profiling applied to the diagnosis and study of human Mendelian diseases frequently identifies direct, casual relationships between genetic variants and downstream accumulation or deficiency of metabolic intermediates, which may vary or progress over time. (b) QTL mapping of single quantified metabolites can identify strong associations between metabolite concentration and polymorphisms, though frequently additional, weaker associations with other alleles are discovered as well. (c) mQTL and mGWAS studies are conceptually similar to QTL studies of individual metabolites, but search for associations between many metabolites and many genes, frequently yielding a larger set of associations between genetic polymorphisms and metabolite concentrations or ratios.Full size image","GWAS currently requires increasingly large cohorts to ensure discovery of new genes associated with disease phenotypes [68]. Although this approach is very efficient, the biological relevance of these associations can be difficult to assess. The identification of phenotypes related to disease mechanism, onset and progression represents a promising research avenue.The systematic search for molecular endophenotypes (that is, internal phenotypes) that can be mapped onto the genome began with the quantitative genetic analysis of gene-expression profiles, referred to as genetical genomics [69] or expression QTL (eQTL) mapping [70]. Treating genome-wide gene-expression profiles as quantitative traits was originally developed in model organisms and applied to humans [70, 71]. In eQTL mapping, cis-regulatory associations between genomic variations and gene-expression levels are discovered by integrated analysis of quantitative gene-expression profiles and SNPs. The identification of a SNP at a gene locus affecting its own expression represents a powerful self-validation. However, eQTL mapping presents a series of drawbacks: (i) frequently analyzed cell lines often have altered gene expression, and access to biopsy samples from organs directly relevant to pathology is often impossible; and (ii) due to the gene-centric nature of eQTL mapping, this approach bypasses the biological consequences of the endophenotypes generating the association.Immediately following the success of the eQTL mapping approach [70], in which cis-regulatory associations between genomic variations and gene-expression levels are discovered by integrated analysis of quantitative gene-expression profiles and SNPs, metabolic profiles were included as endophenotypic quantitative traits. This led to mapping of multiple quantitative metabolic traits directly onto the genome to identify mQTLs in plants [72, 73], then in animal models [74, 75]. In mQTL mapping, individuals are genotyped and phenotyped in parallel and the resulting genome-wide and metabolome-wide profiles are then quantitatively correlated (Box 1). mQTL mapping presents a significant advantage over gene-expression products such as transcripts [70] or proteins [76]: the ever-increasing coverage of the metabolome allows a glimpse at the real molecular endpoints, which are closer to the disease phenotypes of interest. Following the success of mQTL mapping in plants [72, 73] and then in mammalian models [75], this approach was quickly followed by the development of mGWAS in humans cohorts ([77–83], see also the review by J Adamski [84]).One of the distinctive features of mGWAS is the intrinsically parallel identification of associations between monogenetically determined metabolic traits and their causative gene variants (see Table 1 for a list of human mQTL-metabolite associations).Table 1 Human gene-metabolite associations identified by mQTL/mGWASFull size tableThe mechanistic explanation of gene/metabolite associations identified by mQTL mapping can be difficult. The simplest case corresponds to associations between genes encoding enzymes and metabolites, which are either substrates or products of the enzyme they are associated with [74, 75] (Figure 2). This corresponds to a direct cis-acting mechanism. Also, one of the interesting discoveries from results obtained by Suhre et al. is that a number of gene variants causing metabolic variation correspond to solute transporter genes, as the majority of the genes in this category belong to the solute carrier (SLC) family [78, 81, 82]. Again, this corresponds to a direct mechanistic link. In other cases, the link between gene variants and their associated metabolites can demonstrate pathway, rather than direct, connectivity, such as polymorphisms in enzymes associated with metabolites several reactions downstream of the compound directly acted upon by the enzyme itself (as observed with NT5E polymorphisms and inosine).Figure 2The genetics of metabolic profiles in an F2 diabetic rat intercross. This linkage map (a) allows the identification of genotype-metabolite associations. The horizontal axis summarizes metabolome-wide 1H NMR spectrum variation (b). The vertical axis shows the genomic position of >2,000 microsatellite and SNP markers (c). Significant associations with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score >3 (P < 10-3) are reported and the strongest linkage signal corresponds to an association (LOD = 13) between gut microbial benzoate and a polymorphism on the UGT2b gene, responsible for its glucuronidation (d). UGT, uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase. Adapted from [75].Full size imageMore opaque associations may be trans-acting in a broader sense: the causative gene variant can be a molecular switch, and the metabolite it is associated with is in fact regulated indirectly by this molecular switch (further down in the regulation events). This is particularly the case when the causative gene variant encodes a transcription factor, inducing the medium- to long-term expression of entire gene networks, or when the gene variant encodes a kinase or a phosphatase regulating entire pathways on much shorter time-scales. Unlike cis-acting mQTL/metabolite associations, which can be seen as self-validation of the causative gene at the locus, trans-acting mQTL associations present the challenge of identification of the most relevant causative gene at the locus . If a SNP is associated with a metabolite, the closest gene at the locus is not necessarily the most relevant candidate, and further investigation of a larger biological network, such as protein-protein interactions [85], may be necessary to identify mechanistic relationships between genetic variants and downstream metabolism. Despite these challenges, which are familiar to practitioners of biochemical genetics, statistical identification of gene-metabolite associations by mQTL and mGWAS promises to significantly advance current understandings of gene function, metabolic regulation and mechanisms of pathology."
3,The quest for genetic risk factors for Crohn's disease in the post-GWAS era,"Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the other being ulcerative colitis (UC). It is a chronic disease characterized by recurring inflammation of the gut, and is thought to arise in response to the commensal microflora in a genetically susceptible host [1]. It can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, although the most common locations are the terminal ileum and the colon. Symptoms can be diffuse, and include (bloody) diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, weight loss and anemia, and there may also be extra-intestinal symptoms such as arthritis, and eye and skin disorders. Complications such as strictures often occur in CD, and since the inflammation is transmural, fistulas and abscesses can develop, and these eventually require surgical treatment [2]. Most of the medications have significant side effects, and they are expensive, and often ineffective. CD is a major burden on healthcare services, with a prevalence of 100 to 150 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the western world and with a peak age of onset between 10 and 30 years of age [3]. CD is partly heritable; this is reflected in the higher concordance rate in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins. The concordance for CD in dizygotic twins is 4%, and for monozygotic twins it is as high as 56% [4].Prior to the introduction of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), only a few genetic factors (for example, NOD2, which encodes nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2) had unequivocally been associated with CD. However, multiple GWASs have now been performed for CD, and a recent meta-analysis carried out by Franke et al. [5] has unveiled 71 genetic variants as associated with CD; Table 1 highlights some noteworthy genes from that study. Many of the genes cluster in several different molecular pathways and gene networks. In particular, results from GWASs have indicated the importance of the immune system in disease pathogenesis by identifying genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Hence, the association of IRGM, encoding immunity-related GTPase family M, and ATG16L1, encoding autophagy-related 16-like 1, with CD has implicated the process of autophagy [6]. The association of NOD2, CARD9, which encodes caspase recruitment domain family member 9, and TLR4, which encodes Toll-like receptor 4, indicates the involvement of pattern recognition mechanisms of the innate immune system [7]. Other genes are involved in pro-inflammatory pathways (T helper 1 cells and T helper 17 cells) and in anti-inflammatory pathways (regulatory T cells and IL-10), indicating that adaptive immunity also plays a role in CD pathogenesis (Figure 1) [8]. Another interesting association mapped to the FUT2 gene, which encodes secretor type fucosyltransferase and regulates secretion of A and B blood group antigens in intestinal mucosa [9]. Recent functional studies have suggested that fucosylation of mucin proteins is involved in interception and exclusion of bacteria; thus, association of FUT2 with CD might imply a role for the functional state of mucin in CD pathogenesis [10]. Although 5 years of GWASs have identified a substantial number of CD susceptibility loci, as much as 77% of the estimated heritability for CD is still considered to be unexplained [5].Table 1 Notable genes within regions associated with Crohn's diseaseFull size tableFigure 1Schematic representation of the genes and pathways associated with Crohn's disease pathogenesis. The ongoing inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is thought to be caused by an aberrant immune response to commensal microflora in the gut. In patients with CD, defects in first defense mechanisms (that is, disrupted epithelial and mucosal barrier) contribute to increased bacterial penetration (MUC1 and MUC19). Genes involved in pattern recognition (NOD2, TLR4 and CARD9) suggest an increased response of antigen-presenting cells to commensal microbes. Consequently, the NF-кB cascade is activated (TNFSF15), leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Association of REL and UBE2L3 suggest an impaired NF-кB negative feedback. Antigen-presenting cells migrate to Peyer's patches (intestinal mesenteric lymph nodes) (TNFSF11) to present antigens and stimulate T-cell proliferation (IL2RA and TAGAP) and differentiation. T cells of patients with CD, in turn, respond more intensely. Th0 cells are stimulated to differentiate into T-cell subtypes regulated by a variety of the produced cytokines and their receptors. Th17 cells are involved in many immune-related diseases, and they are activated through IL-23R, which, in turn, activates the JAK-STAT-TYK (Janus kinase- signal transducer and activator of transcription-tyrosine kinase) pathway that enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production (JAK2, STAT3 and TYK2). Th1 and Th17 cells are pro-inflammatory, whereas Treg cells downregulate the immune response. Another major contribution to CD pathogenesis comes from autophagy. In autophagosomes, intracellular components, including phagocytosed microbes, are degraded, after which their antigens are presented to CD4+ cells. Autophagy is at least partly regulated by the CD risk genes ATG16L1, IRGM and VAMP3. The activation of CD4+ cells leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the maintenance of the inflammation. All the displayed processes could finally lead to homing of leukocytes to inflammation sites (ICAM1,3, CCR cluster), and neutrophil recruitment. Consequently, chronic inflammation, ulceration and deeper microbial penetrance occur. The known associated genes are shown in red. Table 1 summarizes the associated loci shown here.

These might be additional common variants with very limited effect size, or rare variants with a higher effect size. Part of the hidden heritability may lie in structural variations such as copy number variations (CNVs; a type of structural DNA sequence alteration, including deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions, that results in varying numbers of copies of a particular gene or DNA sequence from one person to the next) or even more complicated mechanisms, such as epistatic, gene-environment and epigenetic interactions.In this review, we discuss the known genetic risk factors for CD, the potential sources of the hidden heritability, and strategies to investigate these.","Thus far, the GWASs performed for CD have implicated many genes, and have thereby provided valuable insights into the etiology of CD. However, there are several ways to explore GWAS results in more depth that might lead to solving a part of the hidden heritability puzzle. The design of GWASs holds several limitations, with the first being the extensive correction needed for multiple testing. Hence, many true-positive findings are discarded because of the stringent significance thresholds, and large amounts of data are therefore ignored. Several methods have been applied successfully to overcome this statistical power issue. A major step to overcoming this problem has been taken by the International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) [11], which performed a novel meta-analysis of six index GWASs and a follow-up study in independent cohorts. This study increased the number of confirmed CD loci to 71, although the explained heritability only increased from 20% to 23% [5].Another way to overcome the lack of power inherent in GWASs is to follow-up specific SNPs (variation in a single base in the DNA sequence; the most common type of variation in the human genome) identified by them. Following up the top 1,000 less-strongly associated loci, for example, could yield new true associations. Meta-analysis of these results with the results from the index GWASs leads to a gain of power, as shown by a study of celiac disease [12]. Another approach is to prioritize genes from the top associated loci based on interaction or functional analyses. This has proven to be a successful strategy in rheumatoid arthritis, where genes were prioritized based on network analysis or interaction analysis [13]. For CD, Wang et al. [14] used a different prioritizing criterion based on pathway analysis and they uncovered a significant association between susceptibility to CD and the IL-12/IL-23 pathway, harboring 20 genes. Prioritizing SNPs based on their effect on gene expression (for example, expression quantitative trait locus, a locus at which genetic allelic variation(s) correlates with variation in gene expression) led to identification of potentially novel associations of CD with UBE2L3, encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L 3 (involved in ubiquitinating the NF-кB precursor), and BCL3, encoding B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein (involved in downregulation of the NF-кB pathway) [15].Results of GWASs and their meta-analyses have revealed that multiple autoimmune diseases have a common genetic architecture [16]. Several studies have been successful in identifying new CD risk variants by testing previously established loci for other immune-related diseases [17, 18]. Festen et al. [19] developed a new method to identify shared risk loci of two immune-mediated diseases with a partially shared genetic background, namely celiac disease and CD. To increase the statistical power, they performed a combined analysis of GWAS results from celiac disease and CD, and identified TAGAP, which encodes T-cell activation GTPase-activating protein, and PUS-10, which encodes tRNA pseudouridylate synthase, as new shared loci [19].The second limitation of the GWAS design is that it does not lead to the identification of causal variants, since the tested SNPs are merely tagging SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD; a non-random association of alleles at two or more loci as a result of a recent mutation, genetic drift, selection, or non-random mating) with the causal variants. Therefore, the effect sizes of known CD loci may be an underestimation of their actual relative risk. To further investigate the known risk loci and identify new SNPs, either as causal or close-to-causal variants, extensive fine-mapping is currently being performed by the IIBDGC using a custom-made GWA chip. In addition, cross-ethnicity fine-mapping has proven successful in exploring conserved haplotype structures (that is, LD blocks) [20]. The most common LD blocks occur in all populations; however, their frequencies vary among different ethnicities [20]. For example, common NOD2 and IL23R variants that are well established in Caucasians could not be replicated in an Indian population, implying that additional variants in these or other candidate genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD in Indians [21]. This principle was also successfully applied in analyzing the IL2/IL21 LD block, which is strongly conserved in Caucasians as opposed to Han Chinese, in which the IL2 and IL21 genes reside on two distinct LD blocks. Both IL2 and IL21 could be identified as separate UC risk loci in Han Chinese [22].Park et al. [23] proposed a method to evaluate statistical power and risk prediction of future GWASs. They estimated that there are, in total, 142 CD susceptibility loci with effect sizes similar to the loci reported in the current GWASs, and that a sample size of approximately 50,000 would be needed to uncover them. However, even if a GWAS with hundreds of thousands of cases were to provide new CD susceptibility loci and explain more of the genetic variance, it seems unlikely that it would capture even half of the estimated heritability since 142 loci only explain 20% of the sibling relative risk for CD. We can speculate that identification of the true causal variants could amplify the effect size for some of the known loci and could consequently increase the discriminatory power of risk models.Another potential source of hidden heritability could lie in sample mix-ups that occur accidentally during sample collection, genotyping or data management. Some genetic variants influence gene expression phenotypes (expression quantitative trait loci); this allows checking for concordance between phenotypic measurements and genetic variants that affect these phenotypes. Westra et al. (personal communication) found that 3% of sample mix-ups decrease the number of loci normally discovered by 23% for a trait with a heritability of 50% and 500 loci explaining the total heritability. Thus, sample mix-ups may explain part of the hidden heritability and it will be possible to detect them as long as databases encompass sufficient numbers of phenotypes that are strongly determined by known genetic variants.GWASs are most likely to remain an important approach for investigating the hidden heritability, since the potential of their results can be enhanced by: performing meta-analyses (for example, between multiple GWASs or between similar disease phenotypes); following-up prioritized SNPs based on pathway, functional or interaction analyses; studying SNPs that have been associated with other immune-related diseases; and expanding the design of GWASs to include samples from non-Caucasians.","Common variants identified by GWASs represent only a small fraction of the phenotypic variation. Thus, much speculation about the hidden heritability has focused on the contribution of variants with low allele frequencies, defined as 0.5% <minor allele frequency (MAF; proportion of the less common of two alleles in a population) <5%, or from rare variants with MAF <0.5%, that are not sufficiently frequent to be captured by current GWA arrays, nor sufficiently penetrant to be captured by traditional, family-based linkage studies [24]. Detecting such variants will be facilitated by advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and by the wide-ranging catalog of variants with MAF >1% generated by the 1000 Genomes Project [25]. Current efforts to identify rare variants by sequencing are likely to focus on the regions of most significant GWAS SNPs and around genes already implicated in CD pathogenesis or treatment. Resequencing of selected susceptibility loci has led recently to the discovery of three IL23R (the gene encoding IL-23 receptor) coding variants that offer protection against CD [26]. The results of this particular study confirmed an increase in effect size with decreasing variant frequency, although rare variants explained less of the heritability than common variants.In addition to resequencing efforts, whole-genome/exome sequencing will be needed to detect rare high-risk variants beyond the LD reach of tag SNPs. Although the costs of next-generation sequencing remain high, they are dropping fairly rapidly as the technologies improve and the process time per sample is becoming shorter; so this method is becoming more and more feasible and accessible for researchers. Evaluating such signals and determining the real causal variant will, however, be a difficult task. Feng and Zhu [27] developed an alternative method for searching for rare variants in previously published GWAS datasets. Their method relies on haplotype analysis across the genome and the hypothesis that multiple rare variants can be captured by many haplotypes. Using this method, they confirmed nine previously established loci and also discovered four new CD susceptibility loci [27].Another approach that may prove to be important is performing resequencing studies of individuals with extreme phenotypes in lipid levels; these studies have shown that such individuals seem more likely to be the carriers of rare, yet non-synonymous, variants [28]. A large number of rare variants may have distinct effects on the phenotype. Therefore, pooling variants of similar effect and locus-specific matching of cases with specific CD subphenotypes and controls throughout the genome may help to reveal some of the hidden heritability [29].","It has been estimated that chromosomal rearrangements (that is, duplications, deletions, insertions and inversions), collectively named CNVs, comprise 12% of the human genome [30]. Currently, more than 15,000 CNV loci are catalogued in the Database of Genomic Variants [31]. Some CNVs have been linked to complex disorders, such as autism, neuroblastoma and systematic lupus erythematosus [32–34]. A recent study suggested that CNVs are enriched in genomic regions containing genes that influence immunity [35]. In particular, low and high copy numbers of the β-defensin gene (HBD2), which acts as an antimicrobial peptide and as a cytokine, have been found to predispose to colonic CD [36, 37]. Yet, in a recent study, Aldhous et al. [38] failed to replicate both of the previously published associations. Moreover, they argued that these two associations could be due to measurement error because of a general deficiency of real-time PCR to distinguish multiple CNV clusters. In addition to the β-defensins, a fine-mapping study of the IRGM susceptibility locus revealed a 20-kb deletion polymorphism immediately upstream of IRGM that was associated with CD risk and IRGM expression [39]. Furthermore, a recent GWAS of CNVs from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium has confirmed these CNVs for CD, and also discovered new CNVs in the IRGM and human leukocyte antigen (5.1 kb) regions [40]. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study also showed that the most common CNVs are well tagged by SNPs in current GWAS chips, and that they are unlikely to make much contribution to the hidden heritability in common diseases. More work is needed to elucidate the functional consequences and impact of high copy-number repeats (for example, long interspersed nuclear elements), and of rare CNVs on clinical phenotypes, such as CD."
