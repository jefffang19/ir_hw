0,Development and testing of the Hereditary Diseases and Genetic Testing (HD-GT) scale,"Despite the expanding research base on the genetic testing process, limited insight exists on how personal understandings of hereditary cancer as well as situational and contextual factors influence an individual’s decision-making prior to and following predictive testing for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). The failure of existing scales to detect psychosocial and behavioral difficulties in this population has led researchers to question the adequate sensitivity of these instruments. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate measures for evaluating the preparedness for and experiences during and following predictive testing for HNPCC.","A grounded theory study of individuals from families with a confirmed HNPCC presence provided the data for item generation and scale construction. The Hereditary Diseases and Genetic Testing (HD-GT) scale consists of 8 scales designed to measure acceptance of hereditary-based diseases and engagement in the genetic testing process. Scale readability and content validity were assessed prior to data collection. The HD-GT scale was administered to a sample of individuals (N = 242; 141 carriers and 101 non-carriers) from families with a MSH2, MLH1 or MSH6 mutation. The Multitrait Analysis Program-Revised (MAP-R) evaluated data quality, and scoring and scaling assumptions.","Preliminary findings support the logic of the psychometric structure of the HD-GT. The rating scale steps (0 to 4) seem to have meaningful divisions as evidenced by the response spread. The MAP-R analysis supported item-to-scale appropriateness, scale reliability (≥ .75) and pattern of scale correlations (internal consistency scores significantly higher than intrascale correlations). Study findings suggest that the family history of cancer does have a significant impact on decision-making regarding genetic testing. There are also indications that individuals place high value on having all potentially at-risk family members participate in genetic testing, but are often challenged trying to convince them to accept the need for testing.","The HD-GT scale represents an initial effort to evaluate personal, situational and contextual factors influencing genetic testing decision-making. Study findings suggest that the subscales appear to be sensitive enough to measure the wide-range of psychosocial and behavioral implications of genetic testing. Further, findings have important implications for health care providers. If providers are to work effectively with HNPCC families they must have the appropriate knowledge, education and skills to recognize the features of HNPCC, take thorough client and family histories, provide support and coordinate care for these individuals."
1,Use of next-generation DNA sequencing to analyze genetic variants in rheumatic disease,"Within the past 6 years, the advent of high-throughput sequencing methodologies has provided researchers and clinicians with an extremely powerful tool for querying large amounts of the genetic landscape within not only single individuals but also cohorts of many individuals. Often dubbed `next-generation sequencing' (NGS) or `second generation sequencing', these methodologies rely on the parallel processing of hundreds of thousands (if not hundreds of millions) of physically sequestered, individually (clonally) amplified copies of DNA, allowing for the generation of massive amounts of data in an extremely short period of time. The resulting datasets, which have become rich gold mines for researchers, provide catalogs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), deletion/insertion polymorphisms, copy number variants, and translocations.NGS DNA methodologies allow researchers to capture particular regions of interest contained within a genome or sequence the entire genome as a whole (whole-genome sequencing). Enriched regions may be specific loci or small genomic regions (targeted sequencing) or the sequences of all known genes and functional elements (exome sequencing). With each method having its own pros and cons, one must consider the scientific objective along with both cost and efficiency when choosing a method. One should not require, for example, the entirety of an exome to be sequenced if the functional variant in question is suspected to be in a non-coding region or previously implicated haplotype block. Similarly, the entire genome need not be sequenced if the study design is focusing only on variants affecting protein-coding genes. Finally, the amount of sequence generated per sample must be taken into account. NGS sequencers are currently optimized to output a set number of reads per run, generally far in excess of a single sample's needs for adequate coverage. To effectively utilize this resource and decrease costs, researchers combine or `multiplex' samples into shared lanes to reduce cost. This can, however, lead to a decrease in the overall number of reads per sample if the allocation is not meted out judiciously and result in reduced reliability of the calls due to insufficient coverage. Conversely, an overabundance of reads per sample may saturate coverage, diminishing returns on variant calling. Numbers of reads for a given sequence methodology have been empirically ascertained, beyond which increased sequence data yield little or no further variant information [1]. This may increase costs unnecessarily, resulting in fewer samples run for a given budget.The major NGS platforms currently available to researchers and clinicians include Illumina's HiSeq and MiSeq, Life Technologies’ Ion Torrent and SOLiD, and Roche’s 454. While the technologies empowering each of these platforms are quite different, with each having its own nuances in performance and powers of detection, they all rely on the ability to shear DNA into short (<1 kb) fragments, ligate adapters of known sequence to each end, and then immobilize and clonally amplify these molecules onto a solid substrate prior to undergoing massively parallel sequencing. An in-depth discussion of the pros and cons of each technology is beyond the scope of this review, but they are reviewed in other publications [2]-[4].Today, these methodologies have revolutionized disease-gene discovery and are now being applied to genetics studies of rheumatic disease. While candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have had great success in identifying candidate genes for many of the rheumatic diseases (for example, >40 known genes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [5], >100 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [6], and >150 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [7]), the extent of heritability explained by the majority of these genes remains small. DNA sequencing methodologies will surely result in additional gene identifications (especially rare variants that are not captured by GWAS methods) that may help explain missing heritability as well as shed light on structural variation within the genome.","Targeted sequencing involves the enrichment of a certain locus or group of loci in a varying number of samples. The two most commonly used targeted sequencing approaches are based on either capture with complementary oligomers (hybridization) or amplification via PCR (amplicon) (Figure 1). Hybridization utilizes short biotinylated oligomers that have been designed, generally by an algorithm supplied by the reagent manufacturer, to tile over the locus/loci of interest. These `bait’ oligomers are hybridized to the genomic DNA sample and allow for the capture of their specific complementary DNA sequences. This approach is generally favored for large numbers of loci and has the ability to cover up to 20 million base pairs (Mbp) of target regions. Amplicon sequencing methods consist of primer-walking across the locus/loci of interest, followed by pooling the sometimes large number of PCR reactions prior to sequencing. This approach is primarily for regions up to 1 to 2 Mbp total, but allows for large numbers of samples to be pooled together in a single sequencing reaction. Targeted sequencing is often the method of choice for follow-up studies of GWAS associations. Its main disadvantage is that it is generally unable to perform well across repetitive elements within the genome, regions that have low-complexity, or extreme A-T or G-C sequence content.Figure 1A comparison of two popular sequence enrichment methods. (A) For amplicon enrichment, PCR primers specific to the region of interest are used to amplify the target area. (B) These PCR products are then prepared for sequencing via ligation with sequencer-specific DNA molecules (adapters). (C) Molecules are then ready for sequencing. (D) For hybridization enrichment, the entire genome is sheared into small fragments which are subsequently ligated to sequencer-specific adapter DNA molecules. (E) Biotinylated oligomers that have been designed to be complementary to the region of interest are incubated with the previously generated sequencing library. (F) Captured molecules from the region of interest are pulled down using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. DNA molecules are then eluted and ready for sequencing (C).Full size imageExome sequencing is, for all intents and purposes, the same as hybridization targeted capture in methodology. The differences lie in the fact that the exome capture systems have been specifically designed to only capture the coding regions of known genes and, in some cases, known functional non-coding elements of the genome. This optimization allows for a single exome capture system to enrich for 35 to 80 Mbp total. The goal in studying the exomes is to identify mutations that alter the amino acid content of a protein, possibly resulting in altered protein function. Exome capture systems may also include the untranslated regions of genes, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs, microRNA genes, and other genomic elements of interest that do not necessarily fall under the moniker of `gene’. The inclusion of these other loci is heavily dependent on the manufacturer and version of the exome capture system. Since it uses the same methods as targeted sequencing, exome capture technology also shares its disadvantages, with approximately 10% of the exome routinely failing to be captured and, thus, being unable to be sequenced.Whole-genome sequencing allows for the potential identification of every variant in the genome. It is the most straightforward of the NGS methodologies since the entire genome is prepared and placed onto the sequencer with minimal processing. However, due to the large number of sequencing reads necessary to cover the entire genome, let alone the appropriate amount of coverage necessary to generate good quality variant calls, it remains the most expensive. For this reason very few rheumatic disease studies have yet undertaken whole-genome sequencing. However, we anticipate that this will not be the case for much longer since the cost for whole-genome sequencing continues to decrease.While we provide below a few examples of how each DNA sequencing methodology has been applied to various rheumatic diseases, additional examples are included for the reader in Table 1.Table 1 
                        Rheumatic disease studies utilizing next-generation DNA sequencing methodologies
Full size table","While not a main focus of this review, there are other high-throughput sequencing methods available to researchers that focus on non-genetic variation (epigenetics and transcriptomics). The epigenome consists of alterations resulting from environmental exposures to chemical, nutritional and physical factors that ultimately result in changes to gene expression, suppression, development, or tissue differentiation without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications can occur on DNA (methylation) or the histone proteins that compact DNA into nucleosomes (histone modification). Several rheumatic disease studies are already utilizing powerful methods to determine epigenetic influences on phenotype and are discussed in multiple reviews [32]-[35].Deep sequencing for transcriptomic studies (RNA-seq) generates more detailed data, including specific isoform, exon-specific transcript and allelic expression levels [36]-[38], mapping of transcription start sites, identification of sense and antisense transcripts, detection of alternative splicing events, and discovery of unannotated exons [39],[40]. To date, RNA-seq methods have been conducted in rheumatic disease studies of RA [41] and SLE [42],[43], and in a murine model of inflammatory arthritis [44].","A number of targeted deep sequencing studies for rheumatic diseases have been used to follow up associations identified by GWASs or custom designed genotyping arrays (Table 1) [25]-[28]. Adrianto and colleagues [27],[28] have performed two such studies in SLE-associated risk loci, TNFAIP3 and TNIP1. TNFAIP3 was first identified as an SLE risk gene by GWAS and encodes the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, which is a key regulator of NF-kB activity [45],[46]. After confirming genetic association in a large case–control association study of five racially diverse populations, Adrianto and colleagues utilized a targeted sequencing approach of the associated TNFAIP3 risk haplotype in seven carriers (two homozygotes and five heterozygotes) [28]. Though they did not identify any novel SNPs, they did identify a previously unreported single base deletion present on all risk chromosomes. This deletion was adjacent to a rare SNP found in Europeans and Asians and, together, this SNP-indel variant pair formed a TT > A polymorphic dinucleotide that bound to NF-kB subunits with reduced avidity. In addition, the risk haplotype that carried the TT > A variant reduced TNFAIP3 mRNA and A20 protein expression. TNIP1 (TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1) has also been associated with SLE in multiple studies, and in conjunction with their studies of TNFAIP3, Adrianto and colleagues [27] performed a similar targeted sequencing study of TNIP1. Targeted resequencing data resulted in 30 novel variants that were then imputed back into a large, ethnically diverse case–control study, and conditional analysis was used to identify two independent risk haplotypes within TNIP1 that decrease expression of TNIP1 mRNA and ABIN1 protein. In a similar fashion, S Wang and colleagues [25] conducted a targeted sequencing study of the SLE-associated UBE2L3 locus in 74 SLE cases and 100 European controls. They identified five novel variants (three SNPs and two indels) that were not present in NCBI dbSNP build 132, one of which was strongly associated with SLE (P = 2.56 × 10−6). The variants were then imputed back into a large case−control dataset, which ultimately led to the identification of a 67 kb UBE2L3 risk haplotype in four racial populations that modulates both UBE2L3 and UBCH7 expression.C Wang and colleagues [26] explored the variants within and around IKBKE and IFIH1, genes also previously identified as associated with SLE. These two genes were targeted using an amplicon long-range PCR-based strategy of exonic, intronic, and untranslated regions in 100 Swedish SLE cases and 100 Swedish controls. In the course of their sequencing, they identified 91 high-quality SNPs in IFIH1 and 138 SNPs in IKBKE, with 30% of the SNPs identified being novel. Putative functional alleles were then genotyped in a large Swedish cohort, which ultimately yielded two independent association signals within both IKBKE (one of which impairs the binding motif of SF1, thus influencing its transcriptional regulatory function) and IFIH1.Davidson and colleagues [8] utilized targeted sequencing of the IL23R gene to identify rare polymorphisms associated with ankylosing spondylitis in a Han Chinese population. Targeted sequencing of a 170 kb region containing IL23R and its flanking regions was performed in 100 Han Chinese subjects and again in 1,950 subjects of European descent and identified several potentially functional rare variants, including a non-synonymous risk variant (G149R) that proved to be associated with the disease."
2,"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for heart regeneration, drug discovery and disease modeling: from the genetic, epigenetic, and tissue modeling perspectives","Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, have the ability to propagate indefinitely in culture and can differentiate into any cell type in the body. As such, hESCs can potentially provide an unlimited supply of even highly specialized cells for restoring organ functions that have been damaged by aging, diseases, or traumas. The discovery that mature somatic cells can be reprogrammed to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [1, 2] further provides investigators with a genetically diverse human model system for studying disease mechanisms, drug screening, and potential new therapeutic strategies.In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka were the first to show that mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to embryonic stem-like pluripotent cells by retroviral transduction with four transcription factors: OCT4 (POU5F1), SOX2, KLF4, and MYC [3]. A year later, the same four retroviral vectors were shown to be effective in reprogramming human fibroblasts [1]. Similarly, Yu and colleagues generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) based on lentiviral transfer of OCT4, SOX2, LIN28, and NANOG [2]. Reprogramming has now been performed and tested with numerous somatic sources, displaying a range of kinetics and efficiencies [4], including accessible sources such as keratinocytes from skin [5], peripheral blood [6–8], mesenchymal cells in fat [9], epithelial cells in urine [10, 11], and oral mucosa [12].Subsequent studies have further reduced the requirement to only one or two factors in the reprogramming cocktail, as small molecules or epigenetic modulating drugs can be used to replace the omitted factors [13]. For instance, the addition of valproic acid, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, allows reprogramming with only OCT4 and SOX2 [14]. Furthermore, to avoid permanent and random genomic integration of viral vectors that can lead to DNA aberrations, various nonintegrative or nonviral methods have been successfully employed in the generation of iPSCs. These include transient DNA transfection using episomal plasmids [15] or minicircles [16], protein delivery [17], transfection of synthetic modified mRNAs [18], or use of nonintegrating Sendai virus [19]. Although hiPSCs are comparable with hESCs in terms of morphology, surface marker expression, ability to form three germ layers, and teratoma formation capacity, mounting evidence indicates that the epigenetic landscape and gene expression profiles vary among different hESC lines and hiPSC clones, which can be indicative of incomplete reprogramming, thereby leading to differentiation potential bias and premature senescence [20–27]. Hence, the choice of reprogramming and differentiation techniques as well as stringent quality controls are critical to the prospects of pluripotent stem cell therapy regimes.","hESCs can spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CMs) under appropriate culture conditions. When hESCs are cultured in suspension with serum for a period of 7 to 10 days, differentiation to derivatives of the three germ layers occurs and aggregates of cells called embryoid bodies (EBs) are formed. EBs can then be cultured on gelatin-coated dishes from which spontaneously contracting CMs will be observed. Within a mixed population of differentiated cells, a minority of EBs develop CMs and beating areas are visible only in 5 to 15% of EBs [28–30] with the actual yield of hESC-CMs being <1%. The efficiency has been reported to be improved by the addition of DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-cytidine [31], by incubation in hypoxic conditions [32], or by co-culture with endodermal END2 cells [33]. Yet the yields of CMs generated by these methods remain poor.Using a series of defined growth factors to guide differentiation toward the cardiac lineage, directed differentiation protocols that significantly enhance the generation of hESC-derived and hiPSC-derived CMs have been developed [34–37]. These approaches have revealed that CM differentiation is orchestrated by sequential expression of different sets of genes in specific stages as follows: mesoderm formation (BRY, MIXL1, FOXC1, DKK1), cardiogenic mesoderm (MESP1, ISL1, KDR), cardiac-specific progenitors (NKX2.5, GATA4, TBX5, MEF2C, HAND1/2), and CM maturation (ACTN1, MYH6, TNNT2) [38]. Three families of growth factors are implicated in the control of mesoderm formation and cardiogenesis. Specifically, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling generally promotes cardiogenesis, wingless in Drosophila (Wnt) proteins are involved in cardiac specification, and fibroblast growth factors drive mesodermal cells into myocardial differentiation [39]. The timing and concentration of these growth factors are crucial for controlling signaling pathways for the induction of directed CM differentiation.In a monolayer-based protocol for directed cardiac differentiation, H7 hESCs exposed to activin A for 1 day followed by 4 days of BMP4 in serum-free RPMI medium supplemented with B27 have been shown to yield >30% contracting CM-containing clusters at day 12 [34]. Similarly in a suspension EB protocol, the addition of BMP4, activin A, and basic fibroblast growth factor to differentiation medium for 4 days induces primitive-streak formation. Subsequent Wnt inhibition with Dickkopf homolog 1 for 4 days promotes cardiac mesoderm specification, which together with vascular endothelial growth factor promotes expansion and maturation. The differentiating cells can be maintained in medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor, Dickkopf homolog 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor to support further cardiac lineage development [35]. A specific population of kinase domain receptor (KDR)low/c-kitneg cells isolated on day 6 is found to constitute a set of cardiovascular progenitors (CPs) that are able to differentiate into all three cardiovascular lineages – namely CMs, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Cardiac genes, including those encoding cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), atrial and ventricular isoforms of myosin light chain (MYL7/MYL2), and cardiac transcription factors (NKX2.5, TBX5, TBX20), are upregulated in the KDRlow/c-kitneg cells and 50% of the population consists of contracting CMs when plated in monolayer culture. With optimal activin and BMP4 concentrations, 80% of the KDR/platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α double-positive population isolated on day 5 differentiates into CMs [36].Recently, sequential addition of activin A and BMP4 to defined RPMI/B27 medium together with double layers of a commercially available extracellular matrix (Matrigel) on day −2 and day 0 of differentiation provided a favorable microenvironment that further promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition for precardiac mesoderm formation. Such a matrix sandwich method results in the efficient production of CMs from multiple hESC and hiPSC lines with high yields and a purity of up to 98% cTnT+-derived cells [37].Furthermore, as Wnt signaling activity is a key regulator of cardiogenesis, early and late Wnt signaling enhances and represses heart development, respectively. Efficient CM differentiation can be achieved via appropriate temporal modulation of regulatory elements in the Wnt signaling pathway [40]. In this robust and growth factor-free approach, the Wnt pathway is first activated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor to induce differentiation on day 0, followed by shRNA β-catenin knockdown or the use of small molecules that block Wnt protein secretion to repress Wnt activities on day 3 of differentiation. Contracting cells are observed on day 7 and 90% of the differentiated cells are cTnT+ on day 15 in multiple hESC and hiPSC lines.Furthermore, chemically synthesized small molecules that target other signaling pathways have also been screened for their ability to promote cardiac differentiation process. Finally, enhanced cardiogenesis of hESCs has been demonstrated through nodal pathway inhibition at day 4 to promote cardiac specification [36] and through inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which favors early mesoderm formation [41]. Select methods of CM-directed differentiation are schematically summarized in Figure 1.Figure 1Methods for cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BMP4, bone morphogenetic protein-4; CM, cardiomyocyte; DKK1, Dickkopf homolog 1; dox, doxycycline; IWP, inhibitor of Wnt production; IWR1, inhibitor of Wnt response 1; KSR, knockout serum replacement; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; mTESR, specialized stem cell culture medium; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.Full size imageAll of the above CM differentiation protocols require optimization among hESC/hiPSC lines, and result in highly heterogeneous cell populations, consisting of a mixture of pacemaker, atrial and ventricular derivatives, as well as some non-CMs [42]. Functionally, the derived CMs respond to electric and chemical stimulation of the β-adrenergic signaling pathway [30, 43], and in general the isolated derived cTnT+ cells display similar gene expression profiles, ultra-structures, calcium-handling proteins, and ion channel functionality typical of immature CMs. Although a striated pattern for α-actinin and myosin light chain is observed [44], the derived CMs lack organized sacromeres and t-tubules [45, 46]. Cell surface marker signal regulatory protein-α and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 as well as ROR2+/CD13+/KDR+/platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α+ cells derived from differentiating hESCs have been detected on CPs that form CMs [47–49], but no convenient chamber-specific surface markers have yet been identified for robust isolation of CM subtypes. Ultimately, identification of accessible chamber-specific surface markers, as opposed to the use of reporter genes, will be required for any eventual therapeutic application.","For safety and efficacy of using hESC-CMs as human heart disease models, for drug screening, or for cell-based transplantation therapies, understanding the electrophysiological functions is of paramount importance. Both genetic and nongenetic approaches have been implemented to promote hESC-CM maturation to recapitulate the properties of the adult counterparts. hESC-CMs have been structurally and functionally characterized by ourselves and several laboratories.hESC-CMs express an array of cardiac-specific transcription factors and structural proteins [28, 30, 43, 50]. While adult ventricular CMs are normally electrically silent-yet-excitable upon stimulation, >50% of hESC-derived ventricular CMs fire spontaneously, exhibiting a high degree of automaticity [51]. The remaining quiescent cells can elicit single action potentials upon stimulation, showing an intact excitability; however, they display a prominent phase 4-like depolarization, a frequent occurrence of delayed after depolarization, and a significantly depolarized resting membrane potential. IK1 is robustly expressed in adult ventricular CMs, but is seen in neither spontaneously firing nor quiescent hESC-derived ventricular CMs. Interestingly, forced expression of Kir2.1 in immature hESC-derived ventricular CMs rendered their action potential properties adult-like, in which the percentage of quiescent ventricular CMs increased up to 100% and Kir2.1-silenced hESC-derived ventricular CMs could elicit single action potentials upon excitation, with a significantly hyperpolarized resting membrane potential indifferent from adult-like but without incomplete phase 4 and delayed after depolarization. Unfortunately, Ca2+ handling stays immature [52, 53]. Contractile apparatus and myofilaments even deteriorate, probably due to the lack of spontaneous contractions after silencing. Indeed, immature Ca2+ transient properties of hESC-CMs can be attributed to the differential developmental expression profiles of Ca2+-handling proteins [52, 53]. In a separate study, forced expression of calsequestrin improves Ca2+ transients in hESC-CMs by significantly increasing the transient amplitude, upstroke, and decay velocities as well as the sarcoplasmic reticulum content, but without altering ICa,L, suggesting the improved transient is not simply due to a higher Ca2+ influx [54]. However, calsequestrin-matured cells continue to have immature electrophysiological properties. In developing neurons, Kir2.1 expression is known to alter excitability by escalating in response to extrinsic excitation via an activity-dependent mechanism to mediate synaptic plasticity, and vice versa. Interestingly, by mimicking endogenous fetal heart pacing by field stimulation in culture, the regulated rhythmic electrical conditioning of hESC-CMs promotes in vitro electrophysiological, Ca2+ handling, as well as contractile maturation with more organized myofilaments [51].","High-throughput screening allows comprehensive analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression, as well as characterization of the epigenetic landscape and detection of changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation status. More specifically, whole-genome expression profiling and RNA sequencing are commonly employed to compare and characterize transcriptomes and miRNA profiles among differentiated cell populations, as well as between iPSC and embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines (reviewed in [55]). Differences among these profiles can be informative of nonuniform epigenetic states that may exist between cell lines. DNA methylation studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq) can also reveal variations in chromatin structure and transcription factor binding. DNA methylation studies of promoter regions are informative of transcriptional activity, because active genes are generally hypomethylated, while silenced genes are hypermethylated. Similarly, genome-wide studies performed by techniques based on ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq permit the elucidation of histone modifications that are indicative of transcriptionally active, repressed, or bivalent patterns of histone methylation. In bivalent promoters, for example, histone 3 is methylated at both lysines 4 (H3K4) and 27 (H3K27). Although H3K4 methylation is associated with gene activation and H3K27 methylation typically results in gene repression, bivalent promoters in stem cells tend to be repressed. With differentiation, this pattern switches from a bivalent state to a monovalent state, which results either in transcriptionally active genes characterized by H3K4 methylation or in nontranscribed genes with a H3K27 methylation state [56]. A number of other histone modifications are also known to affect gene activity, including the repressive H3K9me3, H4K20me3 marks, and multiple targets of histone acetylation, many of which can be assessed through genome-wide approaches. The assessment of these profiles in iPSC lines is extremely valuable when determining their suitability for therapeutic applications, as defects may lead to unintended consequences [57–59]. Principal epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation are shown in Figure 2.Figure 2Major epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation. RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex.Full size imageA comparative molecular, epigenetic, and biological analysis of cells differentiated from iPSCs with somatic cells from which the iPSCs originated is therefore essential to understand the translational potential of these cells. Towards this end, Xu and colleagues recently reported that reprogrammed murine ventricular myocytes form iPSCs that retain the characteristics of epigenetic memory, which is referred to as CM memory [60]. These ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs, relative to iPSC controls derived from tail-tip fibroblasts, display a significantly greater differentiation propensity to form spontaneously beating CMs. Importantly, ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs relative to either ESC or iPSC controls produce greater numbers of CPs at early stages of differentiation. Further analysis of both ventricular myocytes and ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs revealed a number of genes encoding transcription factors (Nkx2.5, Irx4) and contractile proteins (Myh6, Myl2, Tnni3, Des) that appear to play a role in the specification of CPs. While potentially due to a transient state in the reprogramming of CMs to iPSCs, it is also possible that the mild DNA hypomethylation observed in these cells contributes to the process of ventriculogenesis. Somatic cells, at least during early stages, thus retain epigenetic marks on DNA or histones reminiscent of the somatic cell of origin. While these traits may be transient, this system also provides a model to identify which genes are potentially implicated in fate decisions critical to CM generation.Genetic manipulation and alteration in epigenetic regulation through chromatin remodeling also control cell fate. Viral transduction of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) directly transdifferentiates murine fibroblasts into CM-like cells in vitro, skipping the pluripotent stage [61]. Transduced fibroblasts are epigenetically reprogrammed with enrichment of H3K4me3 (active transcription mark) and depletion of H3K27me3 (repressed transcription mark) at the promoter regions of the sarcomeric genes, including Actn2, Ryr2, and Tnnt2. The global gene expression profile and electrophysiological properties of the transduced fibroblasts, which demonstrate spontaneous beating, resemble neonatal CMs. In vivo, delivery of GMT into fibroblasts located in the infarcted zone of murine heart also induces CM differentiation [62]. Ectopic expression of Gata4, and Tbx5 in combination with Baf60c, a cardiac-enriched subunit of the Swi/Snf-like BAF ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, also transdifferentiate cells derived from noncardiogenic mouse mesoderm into CMs [63]. With this combination, 90% of the transfected cells express cardiac α-actin (Actc1). However, GMT overexpression in murine tail tip fibroblasts and cardiac fibroblasts with myocardial lineage reporters (αMHC-Cre, Nkx2.5-Cre, cTnT-Cre) is, however, very inefficient at inducing molecular and electrophysiological phenotypes of mature CMs. While 35% of the cells infected by GMT factors expressed cTnT, the αMHC and Nkx2.5 reporters remain silenced and transduced fibroblasts transplanted into injured mouse heart fail to survive [64]. The discrepancy between these studies may be due to differences in experimental protocols, genetic background of the strain, or levels of GMT overexpression, but it is also possible that differences in the epigenetic status of these cells play an essential regulatory role.Histone acetyltransferase and HDACs control the relaxation and condensation of chromatin structure for transcription. Treatment with HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A during differentiation of murine ESCs promotes CM differentiation [65]. The levels of acetyl-histone H3 and H4 are upregulated in EBs treated with trichostatin A when compared with the untreated controls. This is accompanied by an increase in GATA4 acetylation, which augments its DNA binding to ANF promoter. Administration of trichostatin A between days 7 and 8 of differentiation doubles the percentage of Nkx2.5-GFP+ cells and increases the expression of cardiac genes, Nkx2.5, β-MHC, and ANF. Furthermore, the introduction of transient HDAC inhibition with valproic acid in hESC-derived ventricular CMs amplifies the expression of Ca2+ handling and cardiac ion channel genes that are important for CM electrophysiological functions and induces physical maturation [50]. These pharmacological-mediated results underscore the involvement of epigenetic and post-translational modification of transcription factors in CM differentiation and heart development. Indeed, knockout models of the chromatin remodeling proteins often lead to congenital heart developmental defects or result in embryonic death (reviewed in [66, 67]). Hence, chromatin modifiers, including ATPase-dependent nucleosomal remodelers and histone-modifying enzymes, play a key role in cardiogenesis and are essential for heart development.miRNAs are noncoding RNAs that bind to complementary sequences on target mRNA transcripts. miRNAs function as negative transcriptional regulators via translational repression, or mRNA degradation [68]. Recent reports have demonstrated in the mouse that the absence of the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer leads to differentiation and proliferation defects, highlighting the biological importance of miRNAs in stem cell research [69, 70]. Several miRNAs have been implicated in cardiovascular development of the mouse (for example, miR-1, miR-18b, miR-20b, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-126, miR-133, miR-138, and miR-208).Specific miRNAs have also been characterized and are regulated during hESC-CM differentiation. Overexpression of miR-1 by lentiviral transduction in CPs increases the expression of mesodermal and cardiac marker genes, with accelerated occurrences of contracting areas [71, 72]. miR-1 also facilitates electrophysiological maturation of hESC-CMs, in which decreased action potential duration and hyperpolarized resting membrane potential/maximum diastolic potential due to increased Ito, Iks, and Ikr and decreased If is observed [73]. miR-133 is clustered on the same chromosome as miR-1, but they are functionally different and play opposing roles during CM differentiation. In fact, overexpression of miR-133 represses cardiac markers in hESCs and blocks CM differentiation [74]. miR-499 and miR-208 are also known to affect cardiac function. The miR-499 and miR-208 are encoded by an intron of MYH7 and MYH6, respectively, and they share many predicted targets. miR-208 plays a crucial role in stress adaptation of the adult heart [75]. miR-499 is enriched in cardiac committed CPs and hESCs, and overexpression of miR-499 reduces the proliferation of CPs and augments the formation of beating EBs, promoting differentiation of CPs into ventricular CMs [72, 73]. In contrast, downregulation of miR-499 inhibits cardiac differentiation, suggesting that miR-499 is responsible for cardiac commitment [72].Interestingly, a recent report has demonstrated the direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to a CM-like phenotype using single transient transfection with a combination of miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, and miR-499) [76]. The reprogrammed cells express genes and proteins specific for CM and electrophysiological characteristics of the CM-like phenotype can be observed. Direct administration of these miRNAs into injured myocardium likewise results in direct conversion of cardiac fibroblasts to CM-like cells in vivo.\Interestingly, knockout of single miRNAs often does not lead to embryonic lethality, suggesting that miRNAs may be compensated by family members that differ in only a few nucleotides. In summary, different miRNAs are involved in different stages of development through repression of genes that are likely to contribute to stem cell pluripotency, stem cell renewal, differentiation, specification, lineage commitment, and maturation. Further investigation into manipulation of multiple miRNAs in combination can potentially alter physiological and pathological conditions and can reveal the complexity of miRNA–target interactions and developmental regulatory systems."
