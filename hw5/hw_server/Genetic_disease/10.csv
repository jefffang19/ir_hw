0,Genetic variation in lipid desaturases and its impact on the development of human disease,"Perturbations in lipid metabolism characterize many of the chronic diseases currently plaguing our society, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [1–3]. Lipids constitute a fundamentally important group of diverse metabolites, with critical structural and functional roles within the biological organism. More specifically, many lipid species have been shown to have key roles in such diverse biological processes as signal transduction, membrane trafficking and sorting, morphogenesis, and proliferation [4–6]. While it remains unclear whether perturbations in lipid metabolism are the cause or simply a downstream effect in the development of chronic disease, modifying lipid levels by medical and/or lifestyle interventions remains a primary goal for health management.Lifestyle factors are typically deemed modifiable risk factors in the development of disease and include high body mass index (BMI), physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use, and unhealthy eating habits [7–10]. While the authors recognize that each of these lifestyle factors plays an important role in the development of chronic diseases, there is a growing recognition and appreciation of the relationship between diet and health. Indeed the links between the amount and type of dietary fats consumed, and various disease states, are evident in population-based observational studies [11–14]. These studies have associated diets high in saturated fats, refined sugars and high-fat dairy products with a higher incidence of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer and autoimmune diseases. This diet, typically referred to as the Western diet, is commonly associated with a distinct dietary fat composition enriched in saturated fats (SFAs) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and poor in n-3 PUFA [15, 16]. In contrast a Mediterranean diet emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, wine and poultry, leading to higher intakes of fatty acids such as n-3 PUFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) [14, 17]. These fatty acids are routinely associated with decreased risks for coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases [3, 8].Although poor dietary habits can be detrimental to health by themselves, the numerous interactions between nutrients and genes can further modulate an individual's risk for developing disease [18]. The determinants of plasma lipids are multi-factorial; however, it remains unclear to what extent genetic variability contributes to the inter-individual differences observed in plasma lipid profiles. Identifying those gene variants that can modulate lipid levels is crucial for our understanding of the development and severity of disease. While the molecular pathways underlying lipid metabolism are both numerous and complex, fatty acid desaturases have been shown to play a key role in determining both plasma and tissue fatty acid profiles. Moreover, emerging evidence demonstrates that variation in fatty acid desaturase genes can modify whole-body lipid metabolism.The aim of this review is to highlight the current state-of-knowledge regarding three fatty acid desaturases: stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (Scd-1), fatty acid desaturase 1 (Fads1), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2). We will also discuss human studies that have begun to explore the genetic contribution underlying the inter-individual variability that exists with regards to desaturase activity. This review will demonstrate that fatty acid desaturases represent an important point of consideration for research aimed at preventing and treating various diseases through personalized dietary interventions.","Stearoyl Coenzyme Desaturase-1 (SCD-1) is the enzyme that catalyses the endogenous biosynthesis of MUFAs (i.e. palmitoleic acid, C16:1n-7; oleic acid, C18:1n-9) from de novo synthesized or dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA, i.e. palmitic acid, C16:0; stearic acid, C18:0) [19, 20]. Moreover, SCD-1 has a specific affinity for two of the most abundant saturated fatty acids found in diet: palmitic and stearic acids. Palmitic acid is the major lipid in palm tree oils; however, it can also be found in other vegetable and animal sources. Stearic acid is found predominantly in fats and oils from animals and vegetables, and is usually consumed in meats, cocoa and processed shortening, spreads and baked products. The increased consumption of SFA-enriched foods characterizes Western dietary habits and is associated with the dramatic increases in cardiovascular disease and obesity [13, 14]. As the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of SFAs into MUFAs, SCD-1 has become an interesting target in an attempt to understand the onset and development of the aforementioned diseases.Rodent Scd-1 knockout models have been invaluable for advancing our understanding of SCD-1 function and regulation. While the goal of this review is not to provide a comprehensive description of SCD-1 biochemistry, it is nevertheless important to provide a brief overview of the current state-of-knowledge regarding this enzyme in order to appreciate the recent progress made in human-based research. A thorough overview of SCD-1 biochemistry can be obtained in reviews by Ntambi and colleagues [21, 22]. Recent findings suggest that SCD-1 activity is tightly regulated, and that this regulation is disrupted in various disease states; however, it remains unclear whether perturbations in SCD-1 activity cause disease or are simply a response to disease. Furthermore, it appears that the degree of SCD-1 activity may underlie different health outcomes. Studies using Scd-1 knockout models revealed that an increase in SCD-1 activity is tightly associated with an obese phenotype, while a decrease in SCD-1 activity favours the development of cardiovascular complications due to a build-up of SFAs [23, 24]. Whether alterations in SCD-1 activity induce these diseases is unknown; however, these associations are not isolated cases. Indeed, other disease states such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cancer are also characterized by disturbances in SCD-1 activity [21, 25–28]. These findings reinforce that SCD-1 is a critical player in the regulation of whole-body metabolism and is a promising target for therapeutic interventions [29].To study the role of SCD-1, researchers have used rodents with either a naturally occurring Scd-1 deletion (asebia strain) or transgenic Scd-1 deletions. A lack of Scd-1 caused significant decreases in tissue triglycerides (TG), cholesterol esters (CE), wax esters, and diacylglycerols (DAG), as well as a reduction in lipid synthesis and an increase in β-oxidation, thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity, in the liver, muscle, and brown adipose tissue [19, 20]. The resulting decrease in SCD-1 activity also led to a reduced desaturation index (i.e. the ratio of 18:1/18:0 and 16:1/16:0) [23, 30]. Furthermore, Scd-1 deficient mice were found to be resistant to diet-induced obesity and characterized by decreased body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased hepatic steatosis [31, 32].While such data suggests a decrease in SCD-1 activity may be beneficial for weight management, emerging research indicates this reduction may also contribute to atherosclerosis; thus reinforcing that maintaining a balance in SCD-1 activity is paramount to optimize health. In 2008, MacDonald et al. studied the effect of Scd-1 deficiency on atherosclerosis in a hyperlipidemic, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mouse model fed a Western diet [24]. LDLR-/- control mice developed diet-induced diabetes and obesity in the short term and atherosclerosis in the long term. When Scd-1 was additionally disrupted in a group of LDLR-/- mice, these animals exhibited lower body weights but increases in atherosclerotic lesion areas at the aortic root and plasma inflammatory markers (IL-6, ICAM-1, IL-1β and IL-12p70) [24]. This suggests that the ability of SCD-1 to metabolize an increased intake of dietary SFA is critical in order to prevent atherosclerosis. Further confirming the importance of balanced SCD-1 activity, Fessler et al. analyzed the influence of SCD-1 on inflammatory pathways by studying the associations between SFA, n-3 PUFAs, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) - an activator of the innate immune system [33]. The authors demonstrated that the accumulation of SFA following Scd-1 deletion promoted the development of inflammation and disease via TLR4-mediated signalling pathways. Taken together, Scd-1 appears to play an important role in maintaining a balance in lipid profiles that, when deregulated, can contribute to inflammation, atherosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome. While rodent research provides fundamental information regarding mechanism of action, the extent to which this knowledge can be translated to humans is still unknown.","Few human intervention studies exploring the dietary regulation of SCD-1 are available to date. In 2002, Attie et al. analyzed the associations between diet, plasma TG, and SCD-1 activity in 429 healthy, Caucasian adults [23]. Participants were placed on a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (61-65% energy from carbohydrates) for 4-6 weeks. Changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins levels were examined following the short-term intervention. This study revealed that before the dietary intervention, the C18:1/C18:0 desaturation ratio, an in vivo measure of SCD-1 activity, accounted for 11% of the variation in plasma triglyceride concentrations. However, after the consumption of a diet enriched in carbohydrates, the desaturation ratio accounted for over 40% of the variation in individuals whose triglyceride levels increased after the intervention. This suggests that SCD-1 may play a role in mediating carbohydrate-induced lipemia; therefore future research that analyzes SCD-1 activity within this context is warranted.In 2004, Shiwaku et al. also analyzed the relationship between the 18:1/18:0 desaturation ratio and triglyceride levels [34]; however, the authors additionally explored the impact of ethnicity and dietary habits, assessed by the levels of plasma n-3 PUFA, on this relationship. The study recruited participants from three distinct ethnic groups: Japanese (n = 411), Korean (n = 418), and Mongolian (n = 251). Japanese participants consumed more fish than Koreans, who in turn consumed more than Mongolians. They found that fish consumption was positively correlated with plasma levels of n-3 PUFA. In line with the previously mentioned study by Attie and colleagues, significant associations were observed between the SCD-1 desaturation ratio (18:1/18:0) and plasma triglyceride levels in Japanese and Mongolians groups. Interestingly, this association was non-significant in the Korean group, suggesting ethnic differences. While Japanese and Koreans consume similar quantities of fish, differences in the degree to which SCD-1 activity affected triglyceride levels were observed; further reinforcing potential ethnic-specific factors that regulate plasma triglyceride levels above and beyond the influence of diet. When comparing the three ethnicities, the authors reported that the 18:1/18:0 desaturation ratio, n-3 PUFAs, age, gender, BMI, insulin resistance, and free fatty acids accounted for more than 50% of the variance in plasma triglyceride levels in Japanese and Mongolians individuals. In contrast, these same factors accounted for only 28% of plasma triglyceride varition in Koreans. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia was correlated with an increase in SCD-1 activity and decrease in plasma n-3 PUFA in an ethnic-specific manner. In Mongolian participants however, triglyceride levels were reduced independent of their low plasma n-3 PUFA concentrations, which the authors attributed to their low fish consumption. These findings suggest that SCD-1 activity is sensitive to diet and, more importantly, varies according to the genotype of distinct ethnic populations. Future nutrigenomic research should consider integrating the analysis of ethnic-specific variation in the Scd-1 gene, SCD-1 activity, and dietary habits in order to further clarify the role of this desaturase on clinical parameters commonly associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.","Initial studies in subjects with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) revealed that this genetic condition is characterized by alterations in the lipid profile that may be explained in part by changes in SCD-1 activity [23, 35]. While it does not appear that Scd-1 variants are responsible for FCHL, this does not preclude the notion that genetic variation in Scd-1 may affect enzyme activity and, subsequently, contribute to disease development.Indeed, evidence suggests that genetic variation in Scd-1 may be associated with metabolic and physical parameters characterizing various disease states [36]. Furthermore, genetic studies suggest that these associations may be due to the effect of Scd-1 gene variants on SCD-1 activity, which consequently modifies plasma lipid profiles. Taken together, this reinforces the importance of unravelling the influence of genetic variation in Scd-1 on disease, especially when its interaction with dietary nutrients may modify disease development.The first study examining genetic variation in Scd-1 and its impact on disease was published in 2004 [37]. Liew et al. analyzed the association between Scd-1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in 608 diabetic and 600 control subjects of Irish and British descent. Despite the relatively small sample size used in this study, a borderline association was observed between the rs41290540 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and diabetes risk (p = 0.059), in which the frequency of the minor allele was higher in the diabetic group [37]. However, this promising association was not replicated in an independent follow-up study performed by the same authors. While the lack of reproducibility is of concern, the results do not exclude the possibility that the minor allele for this Scd-1 SNP affects particular traits related to type 2 diabetes [37]. As such, future studies in larger cohorts may clarify the association between the rs41290540 SNP and diabetes risk. In 2007, Warensjo et al. analyzed the association between Scd-1 polymorphisms, SCD-1 activity, obesity, and insulin sensitivity in a population of 1143 elderly Swedish men [36]. They reported that the minor alleles of four Scd-1 SNPs (rs10883463, rs7849, rs2167444 and rs508384) were associated with a lower BMI, smaller waist circumference, and improved insulin sensitivity. For instance, the minor allele for rs7849 was correlated with a 23% increase in insulin sensitivity and 4 cm decrease in waist circumference. In many aspects, the phenotype associated with these minor alleles reflected the metabolic changes seen in Scd-1 deficient mice. Consequentially, the authors hypothesized that these minor alleles led to decreased SCD-1 activity; however, no significant change in SCD-1 activity was observed in individuals with these alleles. While it remains possible this is related to the relatively small cohort, it is more likely that measuring desaturation ratios in plasma fails to accurately represent long term or tissue-specific changes in SCD-1 activity [36]."
1,The diagnosis and management of pre-invasive breast disease Genetic alterations in pre-invasive lesions,"The multistep model of breast carcinogenesis suggests a transition from normal epithelium to invasive carcinoma via non-atypical and atypical hyperplasia and in situ carcinoma. Within the breast, these proliferations are heterogeneous in their cytological and architectural characteristics. The introduction of mammographic screening has led to the increased detection of pre-invasive disease and has highlighted deficiencies in our understanding and classification of such lesions. The morphological classification of pre-invasive lesions of the breast remains controversial and there has been hope that molecular analysis will clarify the uncertainties.A multitude of methods have been used for the characterisation of pre-invasive breast lesions, including immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridisation, analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), and, more recently, cDNA microarrays and proteomics analysis. In this review, we have mainly focused on the genetic abnormalities in pre-invasive lesions of the breast as detected by LOH and CGH analysis (Table 1). The other techniques have been addressed elsewhere in the series.Table 1 Summary of the genetic abnormalities detected in pre-invasive lesions of the breastaFull size table","The analysis of genetic alterations in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has provided new insights in the biology of these lesions. As with invasive carcinoma, abnormalities of chromosomes 1 and 16 have been identified in some of these cases [1]. The CGH method has been modified for paraffin-embedded material and this has allowed studies on archival material and, in particular, the study of pre-invasive disease [2–8]. CGH analysis of DCIS has demonstrated a large number of alterations, including gains of 1q, 5p, 6q, 8q, 17q, 19q, 20p, 20q, and Xq, and losses of 2q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 11q, 13q, 14q, 16q, 17p, and 22q [2–8]. These alterations are similar to those identified in invasive carcinoma, adding weight to the idea that DCIS is a precursor lesion.Several lines of evidence support the concept that different types of DCIS show different genetic alterations, suggesting that there may be multiple pathways for the evolution of DCIS [4, 6, 8, 9]. Alterations at 16q are much more frequent in low-grade DCIS than in high-grade DCIS, in which alterations at 13q, 17q, and 20q are more frequent [4, 6, 7, 10]. Similar findings in invasive carcinomas of low and high grade also support the idea that low-grade and high-grade lesions develop through distinct pathways rather than by dedifferentiation [4, 6, 7, 10]. With the use of microdissection techniques to isolate small microscopic lesions, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has also been investigated in pre-invasive disease [11–17]. O'Connell and colleagues [11] studied pre-invasive lesions using a variety of chromosomal markers and showed that 50% of the proliferative lesions and 80% of the DCIS shared their LOH patterns with invasive carcinoma. Stratton and colleagues [12] studied cases of DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma and cases of 'pure' DCIS without an invasive component using a limited set of microsatellite markers on chromosomes 7q, 16q, 17p, and 17q. They found a similar frequency of LOH in both subsets of DCIS to invasive carcinoma, providing further strong evidence that DCIS is likely to be a precursor of invasive carcinoma. Several other reports corroborating these seminal studies have been published [13–20].c-erbB2 (Her-2/neu) protein has been identified in a high proportion (60–80%) of DCIS of high-nuclear-grade comedo type but is not common in the low-nuclear-grade forms. Allred and colleagues [21] showed that the expression is higher in invasive carcinoma associated with DCIS than in those without DCIS. This oncogene is very rarely overexpressed in classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and its overexpression has been occasionally observed in cases of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ [22, 23]. There is no evidence that c-erbB2 is amplified or overexpressed at the protein level in benign proliferative breast diseases or atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) [24], which may suggest that c-erbB2 is important in the transition from a 'benign' to a 'malignant' phenotype. The difference in frequencies of expression in in situ and invasive carcinoma remains a mystery. A number of hypotheses have been advanced, suggesting either that the expression is switched off during invasion or that many c-erbB2-positive DCIS do not transform to invasive malignancy. Expression of p53 protein has been demonstrated using immunohistochemistry in high-nuclear-grade DCIS (comedo type) [25]. The mechanism may be gene mutation, but this has been confirmed in only some cases. Like c-erbB2, p53 protein expression is rare in LCIS and has not been demonstrated in atypical ductal hyperplasia or other benign proliferative disease [26]. Done and colleagues [27] demonstrated that p53 mutations found in DCIS and associated invasive cancer were absent from benign proliferative lesions from the same breast.In summary, a considerable body of evidence indicates that DCIS, particularly of high grade, shares many molecular genetic alterations with invasive carcinoma [4–8, 14, 15]. Therefore, high-grade DCIS should be considered a direct precursor of invasive carcinoma. Moreover, gain of chromosome 1q and loss of 16q, which are highly prevalent in low-grade DCIS, are frequently found in tubular carcinoma and in tubular, tubulolobular, lobular, and grade 1 invasive ductal carcinomas [4, 6, 8, 28], suggesting that low-grade DCIS is also a direct precursor for certain types of breast carcinomas.","Lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast is an uncommon lesion with a distinctive appearance. It is classically composed of discohesive cells with small, monomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei; however, a pleomorphic variant has been described [23, 29]. It is occasionally confused with DCIS of low-grade, solid type; however, epidemiological studies show that its biological behaviour and clinical implications are quite different from those of DCIS. It is usually an incidental finding and is not visible on mammography [29]. The lesions are multifocal and bilateral in a high proportion of cases [29]. The majority of cases are diagnosed in patients aged between 40 and 50 years, a decade earlier than DCIS. Approximately one-fifth of the cases will progress to invasive cancer over a 20- to 25-year follow-up period [29]. Although invasive ductal carcinomas, especially of tubular type, do occur after LCIS, most cases associated with LCIS are infiltrating lobular carcinoma [29]. It has been said that the risk is equal for the two breasts [30]; however, there are data to suggest that the risk is skewed in favour of the ipsilateral breast [29, 31]. Despite these thorny issues, the epidemiological and pathological features of LCIS have raised questions about its biological nature, and some still consider it a 'marker of increased risk' rather than a true precursor of invasive carcinoma.In our laboratories, we have carried out CGH analysis on LCIS and atypical lobular hyperplasia [32]. Loss of material from 16p, 16q, 17p, and 22q and gain of material from 6q have been found at similar high frequencies in both LCIS and atypical lobular hyperplasia. Losses at 1q, 16q, and 17p have also been seen in invasive lobular carcinomas [8, 33]. LOH data in LCIS are also limited but do demonstrate a similarity between LCIS and infiltrating lobular carcinoma [34, 35].E-cadherin is a candidate tumour suppressor protein coded by a gene on 16q22.1, which is involved in cell–cell adhesion and in cell-cycle regulation through the β-catenin/Wnt pathway [36]. The majority of invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (NST) usually exhibit positive staining by immunohistochemistry, whereas the overwhelming majority of invasive lobular carcinomas are negative [37–39]. E-cadherin truncating mutations associated with loss of the wild-type allele (LOH at 16q) have been observed in LCIS and invasive lobular carcinomas [38, 40, 41]. Berx and colleagues [40] failed to identify any truncating mutations in invasive ductal carcinomas of NST or medullary carcinomas; similar findings were recently reported by Roylance and colleagues [39], who demonstrated lack of E-cadherin mutations in 44 low-grade ductal carcinomas of NST. E-cadherin is expressed in normal epithelium and in most of the cases of DCIS, but staining is rarely seen in LCIS [23, 38, 39, 42–46]. Based on this differential expression of E-cadherin in LCIS and DCIS, some authors have advocated the use of antibodies against E-cadherin as an adjunct marker for the differentiation of LCIS from DCIS [23, 44–47].In addition, Vos and colleagues [41] have demonstrated the same truncating mutation in the E-cadherin gene in LCIS and the adjacent invasive lobular carcinoma. The data provide strong evidence for the role of the E-cadherin gene in the pathogenesis of lobular lesions and also support the hypothesis of a precursor role for LCIS. Although E-cadherin germline mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of familial diffuse gastric carcinoma, there are only anecdotal case reports of lobular carcinoma arising in patients with germline alteration in the gene [36]. In contrast, Rahman and colleagues [46] failed to find any pathogenic E-cadherin germline mutations in 65 patients with LCIS and positive family history of breast carcinoma, thus suggesting that E-cadherin is unlikely to act as a susceptibility gene for LCIS.","ADH is a controversial lesion, which shares some but not all features of DCIS. It poses considerable difficulties in surgical histopathology. In order to address this problem, Page and Rogers [48] laid down criteria for the diagnosis of this entity. Rosai [49] in his study had demonstrated a high interobserver variability in the diagnosis of ADH. However, a subsequent study by Schnitt and colleagues [50], in which the pathologist used Page's criteria, showed an improvement, with complete agreement in 58% of cases. Within the UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme [51], agreement even among experienced breast pathologists has been low. Lakhani and colleagues [52] demonstrated that LOH identified at loci on 16q and 17p in invasive carcinoma and DCIS is also present in ADH with a similar frequency. Similar results were reported by Amari and colleagues [53]. O'Connell and colleagues [13] studied 51 cases of ADH at 15 polymorphic loci and found LOH at at least one marker in 42% of the cases. The studies demonstrate that morphological overlaps are reflected at the molecular level and raise questions about the validity of separating ADH from DCIS. CGH analysis of nine cases of ADH revealed chromosomal abnormalities in five of them [54]. As expected, owing to the morphological overlap with low-grade DCIS, losses of 16q and 17p were the most frequent changes found in ADH [54]."
