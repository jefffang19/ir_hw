0,Genetic pleiotropy in complex traits and diseases: implications for genomic medicine,"Several recent papers have used summary results from genome-wide association studies to characterize genetic overlap between human complex traits and common diseases. The emerging evidence is that individual DNA variants frequently influence multiple phenotypes, often in unexpected ways. This has important implications for genomic medicine and for the application of genome editing.","Pleiotropy is the phenomenon in genetics whereby a DNA variant influences multiple traits. We have known for decades that pleiotropy is widespread because in plant and animal breeding, and in laboratory selection experiments, when selection is applied to one trait, the mean of other traits also changes from generation to generation. The response to selection reflects the genetic correlation between traits, which summarizes the genome-wide average effects of pleiotropy at shared loci. In studies of human traits, estimates of the genetic correlation can be obtained using traditional family-based study designs [1], or high-dimensional genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [2, 3]. These estimates provide no information on where in the genome DNA variants with pleiotropic effects exist, on whether individual shared variants have concordant or discordant effects across traits, or if the effects are causally related as opposed to operating through independent biological pathways. Several new papers have described methods that address these questions using GWAS summary data [4–6]. Here, we review key advances from these papers that enable more in-depth investigations of pleiotropy, and we discuss their implications for genomic medicine.","GWAS have been applied to hundreds of complex traits and common diseases, yielding thousands of genetic associations that surpass accepted standards for statistical significance [7]. Several studies have used results from GWAS to systematically identify genetic variants associated with multiple traits, both across the breadth of human biomedical traits and disorders [5, 8] and for groups of related diseases with prior evidence for a shared etiology (for example, immune-mediated diseases [9]). As expected, pleiotropy is commonly found for variants associated with traits in the same “domain”—for example, Parkes and colleagues [9] identified 71 genome-wide significant variants associated with two or more of six immune-mediated diseases—but there are interesting subtleties to this genetic overlap. For instance, although many shared variants have correlated and concordant effects, a surprising number are discordant, insomuch as they increase risk for one disorder (such as ankylosing spondylitis) but are protective for another (such as rheumatoid arthritis [9]). Conversely, other studies have revealed unexpected associations between traits previously thought to be biologically unrelated. For example, in an analysis of GWAS summary data for 42 traits, Pickrell and coworkers [5] reported the identification of a variant (from among a total of >300 pleiotropic loci) in the ABO gene, which determines blood group, that was associated with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and tonsillectomy (among other traits). A major strength of this approach is that pleiotropy can be investigated without the need to measure phenotypes in the same individuals, meaning that confounding by environmental factors is unlikely.A genetic correlation between traits or diseases can arise due to pleiotropy, as described above, or because of heterogeneity, which refers to the situation in which a proportion of cases for one disease have been misclassified as another. Han and colleagues [4] recently proposed a method, termed breaking up heterogeneous mixture based on cross-locus correlations (BUHMBOX), for distinguishing between these possibilities. In order to detect heterogeneity involving the misdiagnosis of disease B cases as disease A, the approach tests for an excess of positive correlations between independent disease B risk alleles in individuals with disease A—something that is not expected under pleiotropy. Using this approach, which requires GWAS summary data for individuals with disease B and genotype data for individuals with disease A, the authors reported evidence for heterogeneity between seronegative and seropositive forms of rheumatoid arthritis, presumably due to misclassification of a subset of seropositive cases [4]. Heterogeneity is likely to be widespread in complex traits and common diseases, and may be one explanation for the dearth of genetic associations identified for psychiatric disorders such as major depression. BUHMBOX offers a promising tool to differentiate pleiotropy from heterogeneity, although a caveat is that statistical power is limited when the proportion of heterogeneity is low, and yet high levels of heterogeneity may be more likely if pleiotropy is extensive.Pleiotropy can involve a genetic variant having effects on two or more traits via independent biological pathways, for instance due to effects in different tissues, or because the effect of the variant on one trait is causally related to variation in another trait. Pickrell and colleagues [5] recently put forward an innovative method to tease apart these possibilities, by testing if variants associated with an increase in one trait are always associated with a proportional increase in the other trait, but not the other way around. Using this approach they confirmed the widely accepted causal relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and CAD, and identified several other plausible causative relationships, including between body mass index (BMI) and both triglyceride level and risk of type 2 diabetes (that is, BMI-increasing alleles have correlated effects on triglycerides and type 2 diabetes risk, but not vice versa). These are exciting developments because they imply that causal relationships can be uncovered more cheaply and rapidly through statistical analysis of genetic data than by performing randomized controlled trials. However, as the authors note, caution is needed in interpretation because the observed phenotype, which is presumed to be causal, may in fact be genetically correlated with another, unobserved phenotype that is the true causal factor.A form of pleiotropy commonly encountered in GWAS is that trait- or disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequently also associated with variation in gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) and/or DNA methylation (methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs)). Recently, Zhu and coworkers [6] proposed a novel method termed summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) for combining GWAS summary data with eQTL and meQTL data in order to isolate the most likely functional gene or regulatory element underlying statistical associations for complex traits and common diseases. They also proposed a method (heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI)) that can distinguish pleiotropy from linkage, since the observation that a trait- or disease-associated SNP is also a cis-eQTL may actually be due to linkage disequilibrium between the sentinel SNP and other SNPs that are independently causally related to gene expression and the trait or disease under investigation.We have emphasized evidence for pleiotropy from GWAS here, but pleiotropy is also evident for rare mutations underlying Mendelian disorders. Indeed, specific “syndromes” can be diagnosed on the basis of the combination of phenotypes that arise from the same causal mutation. For example, Rett syndrome, caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which encodes a protein important for nerve cell function, is a neurological disorder characterized by intellectual disability and apraxia that frequently presents with short stature and gastrointestinal problems. Another example of a mutation with phenotypic effects spanning different biological “domains” is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) ΔF508 mutation causing cystic fibrosis, a disease of the lung that is also associated with male infertility.","Pervasive pleiotropy has important implications for genomic medicine, particularly as we move into the era of personalized medicine and genome editing. One issue is that focusing on the effect of a mutation or polymorphism on a single disease may be inadequate, since specific genetic variants may show strong associations with multiple traits but in opposite directions [9]. This is especially salient in the context of identifying molecular targets for drug development [8], and when contemplating “fixing” mutations using genome editing approaches such as the CRISPR-Cas system, since this might have unexpected genetic, and therefore phenotypic, side effects. We find more evidence for pleiotropy the more we look, and yet the vast majority of phenotypes are never measured. Indeed, one could ask, given the enormous dimensionality of the phenome, how likely it is that functional variants exist without pleiotropic effects. Herein lies a major challenge for the field, as the possibility of detrimental effects (for example, as a consequence of genome editing) may be hard to rule out.To some extent, this problem will be ameliorated by the availability of GWAS data from very large studies, such as the UK Biobank and US National Institutes of Health Precision Medicine Initiative, in which participants are measured for a large number of phenotypes. In parallel, large-scale genome sequencing studies matching data on rare mutations with deep phenotyping (for example, [10]) will help to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of gene-disrupting mutations in specific genes, and thus clarify if such events are associated solely with deleterious phenotypic outcomes as opposed to a mix of detrimental and beneficial consequences. We can expect these studies to deliver many new and unexpected discoveries on genome–phenome associations, including plausible causal trait relationships. We anticipate that pleiotropy will come to be recognized as a (near) universal property of genetic variants contributing to human phenotypic variation. The limiting factor in progress towards a more complete understanding of the relationship between genome and phenome will be the availability of high-dimensional phenotype data."
1,"Look, no hands! Spectral biomarkers from genetic association studies","Before the widespread application of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the mid-2000s, techniques such as linkage analysis of families and candidate-gene studies had largely failed to identify robust and replicable loci associated with diseases that are common in the population. As judged by the criteria of replication, GWASs have been among the most successful epidemiological study designs to date, in no small measure due to large sample sizes, stringent quality control, simplicity of experimental design, and collaborative transparency between researchers. Yet identifying common disease loci, even when they explain a large proportion of heritability, only goes so far in advancing our understanding of pathogenesis.Many GWASs employ a case-control design, where a set of individuals carrying the disease is compared with a set of non-diseased or population-based individuals. This is a useful strategy for finding loci associated with disease; however, categorizing patients into two classes (such as disease/no-disease) ignores the biological intricacies of the disease at hand, and provides only a rough guide to the underlying etiology. To create more detailed and accurate models of pathogenesis, it is important to look in more detail at the potential intermediate phenotypes, for example, by measuring concentrations of cellular products and enzymes that underlie the processes of disease. The ready availability of the relevant tissues and accurate, high-throughput technology have allowed researchers to leverage metabolomic profiling to elucidate the genomics of one such class of intermediate phenotypes, namely metabolites, which play an important role in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Recent GWASs of the metabolome have identified scores of loci associated with metabolites [2–5], some of which (both loci and metabolites) have been shown to be associated with disease. Furthermore, given known pathway relationships between metabolites and the high dimensionality of the phenotype data, researchers have begun using novel approaches such as phenotype ratios and multivariate analysis of phenotype networks [6] to increase statistical power and interpretation.In this issue of Genome Medicine, Suhre and colleagues [7] side-step a fundamental challenge in previous GWASs, the decomposition of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra into known metabolite concentrations, to expand the power of spectral association studies. In doing so, they present a novel method for identifying previously uncharacterized spectral features that may prove to be important biomarkers of disease.","A large contributing factor to the success of GWASs has been that they are relatively unbiased, in the sense that they assess marker variables that are roughly evenly drawn from across the genome rather than focusing only on specific loci or variants of interest. This lack of bias has enabled detection of previously unknown signals that would not have been found by methods such as candidate-gene studies. Analogously, the new study [7] shows the benefit of considering phenotypes in an unbiased way as well. Instead of searching for previously characterized metabolites in the NMR spectra and testing for association of these metabolites with genotype, the authors examined all available signals in the molecular spectra and associated each one with genotypes in a GWAS-style approach [7]. Similar to unbiased GWASs, the main premise of the unbiased NMR search is that by expanding testing beyond previously known metabolites, some novel classes and associations may be discovered and characterized.To this end, Suhre and colleagues [7] used NMR measurements of plasma samples from more than 1,700 individuals in the KORA study [8]. A workflow of their study is presented in Figure 1. The same individuals were also genotyped using a genome-wide array, covering more than 600,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They binned the NMR spectra into 10,000 bins (spectral features), where each bin represents a potentially different metabolite. Binning is a simple procedure where an NMR spectra is split into windows of equal width (in parts per million (ppm)) and the signal intensity in a bin represents a quantification of the molecule(s) in that window for that sample. Often ratios of metabolites are more biologically informative than metabolite concentrations themselves, as these ratios better reflect enzymatic reactions, in which one metabolite is converted into another at a certain rate. However, exploring all unique pairs of bins for association with each SNP is computationally difficult. Therefore, the authors [7] took a two-stage approach: first all spectral features were examined for association with the SNPs, and then the top 500 spectral features were used to compute pairwise ratios, yielding a total of 133,350 phenotypes. The association between the genotypes and the NMR-based phenotypes (either spectral features or ratios thereof) was tested using a linear model adjusted for age and gender, followed by Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing.Figure 1Flowchart of the spectral GWAS [7]. For each individual, genome-wide SNP data and blood plasma samples were available. Each blood plasma sample was then assayed with two different metabolomics platforms (mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy). The chemical shifts in the NMR spectra were then analyzed using a sliding window to create bins that quantified the amount of each molecule(s) that contributed to that bin in each sample. Traditionally, metabolite concentrations are extracted from NMR spectra using known profiles, but the use of bins allowed the authors [7] to take a hypothesis-free data mining approach. The authors then performed a two-stage GWAS, first identifying the 500 bins with the strongest genetic signals, determining the ratios between each pair of them, and then adding all unique ratios of the top bins in a second GWAS. The phenotype associations of the detected loci could then be interpreted using the mass spectrometry metabolomics data from the same blood plasma samples.Full size imageUsing this approach, seven loci achieved genome-wide significance: LIPC, CETP, FADS1, GCKR, APOA1, CPS1, and PYROXD2. Of these, five are well-known loci that also had been previously reported using a targeted approach on the same data (examining 15 known lipoprotein subclasses). The use of ratios of NMR shifts rather than the individual shifts themselves resulted in lower phenotypic variance and substantially lower P-values for four of these loci than were achievable using the previously reported lipid subclasses.As further validation of the NMR spectra, the authors [7] compared the results from NMR with those obtained from mass spectroscopy, showing that NMR spectra for the detected loci generally correlated with concentrations for the same metabolites determined by mass spectrometry. Although the possible applications of these methods are exciting, one future challenge for phenotypically and genotypically unbiased studies will be the interpretation of the associations detected, as correlation with a known variable is confounded by other cross-correlations.","This study has highlighted two concepts that may prove useful in further genetic association studies of many phenotypes: large-scale unbiased screening of phenotypes and trying to account for inter-phenotype relationships (such as ratios). There is potential to expand the types of relationships modeled, for example, using phenotype correlation networks [6, 9] that capture potential pleiotropy of loci affecting a group of correlated metabolites. More generally, this work is part of a trend towards a systems-level analysis of disease, based on multivariate data analysis of multiple complementary datasets such as gene expression, metabolites, and genetic variation data [10], leading not just to detection of genotype-phenotype associations as in standard GWASs but ultimately to better mechanistic understanding of the pathways and molecular networks involved in the architecture of human traits and disease.",Below are the links to the authors’ original submitted files for images.Authors’ original file for figure 1
