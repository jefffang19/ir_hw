0,Health and genetic ancestry testing: time to bridge the gap,"While genetic ancestry tests marketed to consumers do not currently claim to provide information about disease risk, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep information about ancestry separate from information about health. In this article, we consider the recent and unremarked upon growth in genetic tests and biomedical studies linking markers of genetic ancestry to various diseases and medical conditions. These developments are becoming part of public discourse connecting ancestry and health, but because genetic testing companies, oversight agencies, and professional genetic associations have largely treated health and ancestry genetic tests as independent and distinct, little guidance is available to help consumers understand and interpret the reported connections between genetic ancestry and disease risk. Consequently, when such findings circulate in the public realm, consumers learn that there may be health risks tied to their genetic ancestry even though companies do not report those associations. There is therefore potential for confusion or misunderstanding that is problematic for both consumers and the scientific community. We argue that the various stakeholders in genetic ancestry testing need to reconsider what they communicate about the health implications of ancestry information, both to the public and to each other, in order to effectively bridge the gap that currently exists in policies and consumer guidance regarding genetic tests for ancestry and health.","Genetic ancestry tests were first marketed directly to consumers in 2000, for the purpose of reconstructing genealogies and investigating personal genetic heritage. They quickly became the most popular of all consumer genetic testing services, and more than three million individuals have reportedly purchased these tests to date [1, 2]. Over the last 15 years, companies [3], regulators [4] and professional scientific associations [5, 6] have treated ancestry genetic tests differently than medical or health-oriented genetic tests. Tests that make health-related claims or have implications for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of disease have been subject to greater scrutiny and oversight, as regulators have sought to ensure that potentially life-changing healthcare decisions are not made on the basis of poor quality information or with a lack of appropriate medical knowledge, advice, and support [7]. Genetic ancestry tests have received less attention from legislators, policy makers and regulatory agencies because they are not marketed explicitly for disease diagnosis, treatment, or prevention, and have thus been seen as more “recreational”, less consequential, and less ethically problematic. This differentiation between ancestry and health genetic testing has seemed appropriate because the two types of tests have had such different applications.However, recent developments demonstrate that the boundary between ancestry-related and health-related genetic testing is more porous than previously suggested [8], and it is being transgressed in a variety of ways. When genetic testing company 23andMe suspended its ‘health reports’ in 2013, following a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it continued to provide customers with ancestry information and their raw genetic data [9, 10]. With these ancestry testing data, consumers could still obtain an assessment of their health risks using independent online ‘interpretation-only’ services for as little as $5 [11]. More explicit links between genetic ancestry and health are evident in 23andMe’s re-launched Health + Ancestry Service, which was approved by the FDA as a ‘medical device’ and provides both ancestry and health information. This service directly connects ancestry to health in its ‘wellness’ reports for traits like lactose intolerance and in its ‘carrier status’ reports for medical conditions like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, as both link risk estimates to named racial/ethnic groups. At least one other leading genetic testing company (Ancestry.com) is in discussions with the FDA about expanding its service to include similar carrier status reports [12]. Furthermore, as we show in this article, even when genetic ancestry tests report only an individual’s ancestry, consumers can become aware of possible health risks tied to their genetic ancestry via media coverage of scientific studies and online discussion groups.This blurring of the line between genetic ancestry and health accentuates the gaps that currently exist in policy and in the available guidance for consumers because little attention has been given to the health implications of genetic ancestry testing. However, as others have noted, it may become common for consumers to share their ancestry test results or ancestry-related estimates of disease risk with their physicians, expecting such information to inform their healthcare decisions and improve their quality of care [13, 14]. It is therefore crucial that we bridge these gaps to ensure that genetic testing information is used appropriately in health-related decisions and clinical care. This is especially important because most physicians lack the expertise needed to interpret and contextualize the results of genetic tests: only 29% of US clinicians surveyed rate their knowledge of genetics as excellent, very good, or good [15], and less than a third of the physicians surveyed in five European countries were confident or very confident in their ability to carry out basic medical genetic tasks [16]. Given these findings, there is a real risk that consumers or their physicians could make problematic and potentially irreversible healthcare decisions based on inaccurate, misleading, or misinterpreted genetic testing results. Genetic ancestry information has been misinterpreted or over-interpreted in the past [17–19], and it has been used in ways that reach far beyond the intended or anticipated scientific applications — for example, in controversial attempts to use genetic ancestry tests to support Native American tribal membership claims [20] and to infer nationality in asylum cases [21].Thus, it is critical that we recognize and address the increasingly porous boundary between genetic tests for ancestry and health because (1) genetic ancestry tests can provide information that has consequences for health decision-making, (2) test-takers may have unrealistic expectations about the scientific and medical certainties offered by the tests they have purchased, (3) many physicians are not prepared to interpret and apply the genetic test results that their patients may bring into the clinic, and (4) better guidance for consumers is needed to ensure that health-related information from genetic ancestry tests is interpreted and applied in valid ways. This is especially important because, as we show in the next section, scientific and biomedical studies have been drawing ever more connections between ancestry and health, and there is evidence that these connections are beginning to affect consumer interpretations of their genetic ancestry test results.","Genetic ancestry plays an important role in contemporary biomedical science. Medical genetic studies, for instance, commonly use ancestry inferences derived from autosomal markers (typically single nucleotide polymorphisms or “ancestry informative markers”) to control for population stratification, a practice that underpins the now routine reporting of population-specific or ancestry-specific estimates of disease risks and drug response in genetic epidemiology [13, 22]. Far less attention has been given to the fact that studies using uniparental genetic markers have uncovered connections between ancestry and health. These tests have been a mainstay of the direct-to-consumer ancestry-testing marketplace, but have been widely considered to have little biomedical value [13].Over the last decade, hundreds of biomedical studies have been published that suggest that certain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome variants (and the haplogroups defined by those variants) are associated with an increased risk of disease and other health complications [23]. These variants and haplogroups have been linked to a diverse array of common diseases and medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, heart transplant complications, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, advanced age-related macular degeneration, hearing loss, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, complications from type 2 diabetes (especially retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and renal failure), several types of cancer (breast, thyroid, pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal, prostate, renal, and lung cancer), and the rate of AIDS progression in HIV patients (an additional table shows examples of associations discussed in the biomedical literature [see Additional file 1]). The exact causes of these associations are not always clear, but it is thought that the associated genetic variants alter the expression of key gene pathways [24] or, in the case of mtDNA, contribute to the development and progression of disease by affecting energy metabolism and important cellular processes, including ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxygen consumption efficiency, calcium signaling, and apoptosis [25–27].It is important to note that the quality of studies reporting associations between mtDNA/Y chromosome haplogroups and disease susceptibility is quite variable. Some haplogroup-disease associations are supported by multiple independent studies with rigorous statistical designs, but many others are not. The biomedical literature includes a large number of studies that suffer from small sample sizes, inappropriate controls for population stratification, and/or problematic statistics (for example, P-values that have not been corrected for multiple comparisons), so some of the reported haplogroup-disease associations are almost certainly false positives. Other researchers have also drawn attention to these problems [23, 28]. However, regardless of the quality of these studies, many publications present possible associations between mtDNA/Y haplogroups and disease risk, and consumers are becoming aware of these reports as they garner media attention and enter public discourse.In 2012, for example, a study published in The Lancet found that British men belonging to Y chromosome haplogroup I have a 50% higher age-adjusted risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than other British men, with haplogroup I being the most significant predictor of CAD after HDL cholesterol and lipid-lowering treatment [24]. This finding was widely reported by the media in the UK, US, and Australia, under headlines about heart disease risk being inherited along paternal lines (Tables 1 and 2). This coverage demonstrated the potential for raised consumer expectations about the value of genetic ancestry information to health, and the future possibilities of acting on that information. One article, for example, suggested that: “when a screening test is developed to find those Y chromosome gene clusters and researchers have a better understanding of how they act, it may be possible to protect some [unlucky men] from having heart attacks.” [29] The UK National Health Service added an extensive discussion of ancestral haplogroups and CAD to their patient information website, NHS Choices, after the study was published — albeit to argue that this information was not of immediate use for tackling CAD in the UK because, among other reasons, “men are unlikely to know their specific haplogroup, so are unlikely to know whether they may be at increased risk of CAD” [30]. Ancestry testing consumers discussed this Lancet study (along with other reports of haplogroup-associated disease susceptibilities) in online forums (in threads entitled, for example, “Medical conditions associated with Y-chromosome haplogroups” and “Do not read if you are a hypochondriac…”), and a Principal Scientist at 23andMe blogged about the study, expressing skepticism about the study’s conclusions and offering an alternative analysis using his company’s data (Table 3). Thus, by following the circulation of this study in public domains, we can see variation in how the study was understood, disagreement over the robustness of its conclusions, and a lack of clarity about the significance of genetic ancestry markers like haplogroups to health.Table 1 Coverage of Charchar et al.

While similar observations can be made about studies of autosomal or genome-wide markers and disease risk, we have focused here on uniparental genetic markers because mtDNA and Y chromosome tests are the two types of genetic ancestry tests that companies, policy-makers, regulators, and professional scientific associations have invariably treated as less relevant to health. However, as we have shown, there is public interest in the extensive biomedical literature investigating the associations between mtDNA/Y chromosome haplogroups and disease, and some consumers of genetic ancestry tests are already trying to understand how their ancestry is relevant to their health and disease prognosis in light of these research findings. Other consumers are also likely to encounter the results of these biomedical studies in the popular press, in online forums, in literature from their healthcare provider, or in well-known medical journals, and they too may grapple with the possible health implications of their genetic ancestry test results. Therefore, even when genetic ancestry tests report only an individual’s ancestral lineage or uniparental haplogroup, consumers can become aware of the possible relationship with genetic health risks because scientists have linked haplogroup ancestry to health outcomes.","Like the repurposing of genome-wide ancestry test data to assess health risks, and like the use of autosomal genetic markers in genetic epidemiology to identify population-specific disease risks and drug response, the reported associations between uniparentally-inherited haplogroups and various diseases represent another blurring of the line between genetic information on health and ancestry. Developments in scientific knowledge and commercial practice appear to be outpacing the current oversight and governance regimes that largely treat genetic tests for ancestry and health as separate and distinct.We therefore suggest that it is time for the various stakeholders in genetic ancestry testing to reconsider what they communicate about the health implications of ancestry information, both to the public and to each other. This will require considering some difficult questions. For example, can and should consumer genetic testing companies take responsibility for the ways in which test-takers connect ancestry test results with other publicly available information? Can and should genetic testing companies, alongside scientific associations and consumer advocates, provide guidance to consumers about the accuracy and reliability of the various postulated associations between haplogroups (or other genetic markers) and health risks? How can those who communicate about the relevant science (scientific researchers, journal editors, science journalists, genetic testing companies, consumer advocates, policy advisors, etc.) achieve maximum clarity regarding the potential health implications of genetic ancestry (or the lack of them), and make effective use of the published critiques of the putative links between uniparental haplogroups and health risks [23, 28]? Should there be any changes to policies governing the regulation or oversight of consumer genetic testing, or additions to guidelines being developed by professional associations like the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)?To help address the issues raised here, we make five recommendations for stakeholders in consumer genetic testing to consider:

(1)
The ASHG or another respected professional genetics society should organize a roundtable to bring the various stakeholders together to produce authoritative guidance that will inform and benefit consumers, and help create a set of standards for the industry to follow. This guidance should make clear what we can and cannot know from genetic ancestry testing, and provide guidance regarding the accuracy and reliability of associations between genetic markers and health risks. Industry representatives, consumer advocates, policy and legal advisors, biomedical researchers, social scientists, and regulators should all be involved in drafting this guidance.


(2)
Consumer advocates, scientific organizations, companies, science journalists, and government agencies should play a role in making this information available to consumers.


(3)
Genetic ancestry testing companies should report only associations between genetic markers and diseases/medical conditions that have been scientifically validated. They should also provide information about the limitations of their tests (as 23andMe now does as part of their ‘carrier status’ and ‘wellness’ reports; [31]) and include information about how to interpret the connections between ancestry and health among their FAQs.


(4)
Medical schools and continuing medical education (CME) programs should discuss the potential health implications of genetic ancestry information so that physicians can help their patients to interpret and contextualize their genetic testing results.


(5)
Policy-makers and government agencies may wish to reconsider current oversight regimes for direct-to-consumer genetic testing in light of the increasingly porous boundaries between tests for health and ancestry.


Our recommendations are aimed at encouraging novel and timely interventions into ongoing debates about direct-to-consumer genetic tests, especially since the US FDA, European Commission, ASHG, and high-profile ancestry testing companies are all considering scientific, ethical, and regulatory issues regarding health-related genetic testing. Now is the time to start bridging the gap in our current approaches to health and ancestry genetic testing."
1,Opinion on moderate/low cancer genetic risk markers in medical practice,"The most important concern relates to basic considerations. In monogenic hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g. hereditary breast cancer, HNPCC, FAP, etc.) you have a family history, a specific tumour spectrum, an evident mode of inheritance, etc. In these cases there is a defined (limited) number of persons affected with a defined, high tumour risk due to a highly penetrant mutation in a limited number of genes. Due to the high predictive power regarding disease manifestation, we consider that the search for genetic factors in these families is straightforward and helpful for predictive diagnostics, surveillance and therapy.In sporadic cancer - or families with a certain unspecific clustering of tumours - many, if not numerous, low/moderate risk variants will contribute to cancer risk. Moreover, it is unknown to date whether the interaction of individual markers is based on additive, multiplicative, or epistatic effects. Even if all potential risk factors were identified and correctly interpreted, the predictive value for a given individual would still be limited.Although the heritability of common sporadic cancers seems to be a substantial burden (estimates range from 26 to 42%, for CRC e.g. around 35%), several studies agree that probably 60-90% of the common cancers can be explained by environmental factors. Evidence for the predominant influence of environmental factors comes from three directions:

i)
twin studies where the rate of concordance in monozygotic twins is generally less than 15%,


ii)
migration studies,


iii)
studies on the risk of a second primary cancer in paired organs.

Based on these observations it seems to be impossible to provide sufficient individual risk assessments on the basis of low/moderate genetic risk factors alone [1, 2].Assuming an optimal situation, all identified low/moderate susceptibility variants together (e.g. an SNP-based ""risk profile"") may represent an important risk factor beside e.g. environmental influences. However, if dozens or hundreds of low/moderate risk markers are known, a huge number of combinations and interactions of various markers is possible in a given individual, leading to all imaginable degrees of risk values throughout the population (maybe comparable to a Gaussian normal curve of distribution). It will be very difficult to calculate and validate the tumour risk conferred by each potential combination of variants, delineate different risk groups (which might always be arbitrary in a flowing risk model), and to develop appropriate specific surveillance and prevention strategies for all different risk groups, in particular due to the low number of persons harbouring a certain risk combination as well as compliance problems. Moreover, the role of protective factors is difficult to assess, and the influence of environmental or other non-genetic factors is not considered at all by the low/moderate risk genetic approach. Nowadays, the risk identified by e.g. certain SNPs is just a statistical correlation that cannot adequately predict the individual risk.Anyway, to validate and recommend individualised prevention/surveillance protocols based on those profiles, much longer term clinical studies on large numbers of patients are needed. Even in late onset monogenic disorders the identification of a highly penetrant mutation in a healthy carrier does not often allow accurate prediction of the course of future disease (time at onset, spectrum of symptoms, complications, etc), although we all realise that probably not all carriers need the same kind and intensity of surveillance.","Molecular genetic tests in hereditary cancer syndromes are applied to a target population that is aware of its high tumour risk due to family history. Therefore, ethical or psychosocial problems in this context are mostly controllable, assuming that genetic counselling is offered to the selected patients. Moreover, you have ""real facts"" to explain to them, and can provide a real help by predictive diagnostics and surveillance for persons at risk and identified mutation carriers.In contrast, the low/moderate cancer risk marker approach implies broad genetic screening of the general population (population screening) for polymorphic variants in different genes, since there is no other way to select the target population. Thus, practical application will exhibit all the problems typical for population screening: the people who might benefit are healthy, have no family history of tumours and are at (low) a priori life-time risk of developing any type of cancer. As most people including physicians are not familiar with the correct interpretation and communication of risk figures, the test results are prone to be misunderstood in both ways, a false positive or false negative, leading to unfounded concerns or unfounded reassurance. Since every person will carry a few risk factors, the whole population might feel some kind of illness or risk for something after being tested. It will be a challenge to provide adequate genetic counselling to the large number of tested individuals, and to explain the complex risk figures and the difference between statistical association and individual risk. As a consequence, low/moderate risk gene screening will create a lot of uncertainty and anxiety in the population.If it is accepted that patients with a relatively small risk increase (compared to monogenic disorders) might benefit from some kind of prevention/surveillance or modifications of existing population screening programmes, respectively, serious compliance problems may occur. Even high risk groups (e.g. mutation carriers for hereditary tumour syndromes) often do not perform surveillance at the desired intensity; the acceptance of less intensive surveillance for moderate risk prevention might be worse. Also, the surveillance methods applied, e.g. in hereditary tumour syndromes, are not free of (serious) side effects and complications, and thus their recommendation and intensity must always be balanced against the level of potential benefit. The risk/benefit ratio will only be sufficient in patients with a certain degree of risk. As probably most surveillance recommendations (e.g. gastrointestinal endoscopy) for low/moderate risks are not validated adequately, over-protection of patients accompanied by unnecessary side effects might be the consequence. Partly, these problem might be more relevant in hereditary tumour diseases and other conditions where invasive techniques of surveillance are applied compared to diseases where prevention strategies are restricted to (harmless) changes in diet, etc.","This aspect includes not only the costs of molecular diagnostics, but also the costs of clinical surveillance programmes that follow for a given combination of low risk markers. While the current, relatively high costs of molecular diagnostics are expected to decrease due to the introduction of new and cheaper technologies (e.g. multiplex analysis of different variants), the costs for genetic counselling and clinical management will largely increase. It seems reasonable that almost every individual will have at least a few low/moderate risk markers. This would result in an increasing number of clinical surveillance programmes. It is expected that our health systems will manage the costs for molecular diagnostics and surveillance that are actually applied to families with hereditary cancer syndromes, but it would probably be substantially overloaded by the introduction of the low/moderate genetic risk approach in routine practice.","If the low/moderate genetic risk marker approach were broadly introduced to clinical practice, it is expected that legal aspects would expand. For a general practitioner (and not only for them) it is extremely difficult to understand the proper meaning of the genetic test itself and of the clinical consequences resulting from the test results. In order to avoid getting into legal trouble, this approach may lead to over-prevention by surveillance for each individual once the screening is introduced to clinical practice. The appropriate level of informed consent and pre-test counselling as well as the group of health care professionals who should be allowed to offer and interpret the (population-based) genetic screening are completely unknown to date. In any case, the broad introduction of low/moderate genetic risk screening will require new structures in health care systems."
2,Update of the EMHG database on genetic variants in type 1 ryanodine receptor and their possible impact on phenotype,"The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1) is expressed in human skeletal muscle and plays a key role in calcium homeostasis. Most patients with malignant hyperthermia (MH) have mutations in the RYR1 gene.Today, the gold standard for MH diagnosis is an invasive open muscle biopsy followed by the in-vitro-contracture-test (IVCT). Less invasive diagnosis using molecular genetic methods is of increasing importance, but knowledge about genetic variants in RYR1 is limited. The European MH Group (EMHG) RYR1 mutation database is not up-to-date and lacks information on a significant number of more recently identified variants or further knowledge on variants already in the database. Therefore, the need for an update in order to expand the use of molecular genetic testing is required.The aim of this study was to collect information about variants in the RYR1 gene and their functional effect. Finally this information will be imported into the EMHG RYR1 mutation database.","PubMed was used for data collection. For the search, the three keywords ""Malignant Hyperthermia"", ""Mutation"" and ""Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel"" were used; the operator was ""AND"". Publication dates from the beginning of 2006 to the end of 2012 were selected. However, some older and newer studies were also included if they seemed important for the gain of information. Additionally, the considered papers had to be relevant for the human species. The software EndNote X7 (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for administration of references and data was collected and processed in Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmont, WA, USA).","Altogether 62 publications were found according to the search algorithm. In the newly created database, an overall of 316 variants were gathered. 143 variants were not yet in the EMHG database, 129 of them not functionally characterized or non-pathogenic, 13 functionally characterized and putatively causative and one causative (p.H4833Y), respectively.Among another 11 variants which were already in the EMHG database two (p.R530H, p.R2336H) can be classified as causative (Figure 1).Figure 1Location of the newly Identified and functionally characterized RYR1 variants in the RYR1 gene. MH I-III: Hot spots in which most MH associated mutations are found today. MH I = N-terminal region (p.C35-p.R614), MH II = central region (p.D2129-p.R2458), MH III = C-terminal region (p.l3916-p.G4942). The variant p.H4833Y (in bold) fulfils all criteria to be used in genetic testing and is therefore a causative mutation.Full size image","This study shows that important additional information on variants in RYR1 was published since 2006. However, only three mutations (p.R530H, p.R2336H and p.H4833Y) can be newly classified as causative mutations according to the EMHG guidelines. The main reason for this disappointing conclusion is the fact that the criterion ""co-segregation with the disease in at least two pedigrees"" according to the EMHG guidelines was missing in otherwise MH causative mutations. Nevertheless, this update of the database gives easier access to genetic information and emphasizes the increasing significance of genetic testing."
3,Genetic epidemiology: Systemic sclerosis,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also termed 'scleroderma', is a multisystem connective tissue disease characterised by excessive fibrosis, vascular abnormalities, and immune dysfunction. There is a strong predominance of affected females over males (3:1), and the peak age of onset is 30 to 50 years. There are two disease subtypes, defined on the basis of the extent of skin involvement: limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous [1]. These two subtypes have differing natural histories, prognoses, and autoantibody associations. Patients with limited cutaneous disease have prominent vascular features, often with severe digital ischaemia and, later on in their disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension.In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the concept of SSc, similar to that in other rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, as a multifactorial disease, possibly triggered by environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A genetic predisposition to SSc is suggested by the following: familial SSc (families with multiple cases, although rare, have been reported); animal models; and associations between SSc and polymorphisms in what is now a sizable number of genes.","Recent large cohort studies from Australia and the USA reported that SSc occurred in one or more first-degree relatives in 1.4% [2] and 1.6% [3] of the families of patients with SSc. These figures compare with an estimated prevalence of SSc in the USA of 2.6 cases/10,000 (0.026%) [3]. Familial risk can be quantified as a recurrence rate (λ), and on the basis of these figures, λr (for first-degree relatives) is 54. This is a high value in comparison with the values for many other complex diseases, and the conclusion from these studies is that although the absolute risk for each family member is less than 1%, a positive family history is the strongest risk factor yet identified for SSc. Comparison of concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins can also be used to quantify the genetic component of susceptibility, but in a condition as rare as SSc, collecting sufficient twin pairs is likely to be extremely difficult. Not surprisingly, therefore, relatively few twin studies have been reported: De Keyser et al. recently reported concordance for scleroderma in two pairs of identical female twins – one pair with SSc, the other pair with localised scleroderma [4].","Two of the best-known animal models for SSc are the tight skin 1 (tsk1) mouse and the University of California at Davis line 200 (UCD 200) chicken. Of these two models, only the UCD 200 chicken develops vascular injury [5]. The tsk1 mouse possesses a duplication within the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene [6], which encodes a glycoprotein that is a major constituent of 10–12-nm microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. The UCD 200 chickens show early endothelial-cell apoptosis, followed by perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells and collagen deposition [7]. Thus these animal models provide insight into how genetic abnormalities that are presumably different can lead to a fibrosing phenotype. Recently, Yamamoto et al. have described a bleomycin-induced mouse model for scleroderma – certain strains of mouse (Ch3/He and B10.A) were particularly susceptible to bleomycin-induced dermal sclerosis, emphasising how genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger may both play a role in the pathogenesis of SSc [8].","Over the past 10 years, the genetic basis of an ever-increasing number of complex or multifactorial conditions has been investigated through the approach of nonparametric analysis of linkage in affected sibling-pair families. Such studies screen the whole genome in search of loci linked to disease. Hundreds of families are required for adequate power and the approach is not likely to be feasible for SSc except in an internationally coordinated study. Such a study, in turn, could be complicated by genetic heterogeneity across populations: a recognised feature of SSc. The highest disease prevalence observed to date was in a genetically isolated population of Choctaw American Indians. This population offers a rare opportunity to study large, extended pedigree(s) with many affected individuals. With the exception of studies in this population, all investigations of the genetic basis of SSc have been disease-association studies, in which allele or genotype frequencies of polymorphisms in potential disease genes are compared in cases and controls. This approach has advantages, but there are many examples in the literature, in all diseases, of both false-positive and false-negative results arising from poor study design. Ideally, cases and controls should be well matched, power calculations should be used to determine the appropriate number of samples to be analysed, and positive associations should be replicated in independent cohorts. Recent data suggest that the selection of markers for association studies is critical, because old assumptions about linkage disequilibrium do not necessarily hold true [9].The complex pathophysiology of SSc means that there are a great many genes that are potential 'culprits', either singly or, more likely, together, in driving the disease process. Thus, genes involved in fibrosis, in vascular structure and function, and in autoimmunity all warrant investigation. The genes discussed below are among those that have already been examined in recent years.Genes primarily involved in fibrosis/excessive extracellular matrix accumulationFibrillin 1Tan et al., in an extension of their previous work on fibrillin 1 [10], reported that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of FBN1 was strongly associated with SSc in Choctaw Indians (who have a very high prevalence of SSc) and that the two haplotypes in Choctaws containing this polymorphism have associations with SSc in Japanese patients [11]. FBN1 had been chosen as a candidate gene because it mapped to the region of linkage on chromosome 15q identified in the earlier study and because of the duplication of FBN1 gene in the tsk1 mouse.COL1A2Hata et al. reported the association with SSc of a specific combination of functional dinucleotide repeats (13,6,8)-12 in the human type-I-collagen α2 chain (COL1A2) gene, especially in male patients with disease-specific autoantibodies [12].Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)TGF-β1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis and its expression is increased in sclerodermatous skin. It therefore seems an obvious candidate gene. However, Zhou et al., using microsatellites and intragenic markers, found no significant associations between TGF-β1, TGF-β receptors I and II, latent TGF-β1-binding protein, platelet-derived growth factors A and B (and their receptors), and SSc in Choctaw Indians; although one microsatellite near the TGF-β1 receptor I showed a difference in allele frequency between SSc patients and controls, this result was thought to be a false positive [13]. Similarly, we found no association between SSc and microsatellite markers for TGF-β1 or for platelet-derived growth factor B, but we did find associations between SSc and markers for TGF-β3, TGF-β2, and (in males only) tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 [14]. The TGF-β associations were dependent on disease subtype: limited cutaneous disease was associated with TGF-β2 and diffuse cutaneous disease, with TGF-β3 [14].Genes implicated in pulmonary fibrosisThe most life-threatening aspect of excessive fibrosis is fibrosing alveolitis. Investigators have recently reported polymorphisms in the fibronectin gene in SSc-related pulmonary fibrosis [15]. The same investigators went on to examine polymorphisms of the IL-8 and IL-8-receptor genes CXCR1 (IL8RA) and CXCR2 (IL8RB) in patients with SSc (subclassified as those with and those without fibrosing alveolitis), in patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and in healthy control subjects: while there was an association between SSc and two polymorphisms of the CXCR2 gene, this association was independent of the presence or absence of fibrosing alveolitis [16].Genes primarily involved in vascular function and structureThe recent developments in the genetics of pulmonary arterial hypertension have been of considerable interest to those with an interest in SSc [17]. Mutations in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor II, a member of the TGF-β-receptor family, have been identified in patients with familial primary pulmonary hypertension [18], and mutations in activin-receptor-like kinase I, a TGF-β receptor, have been identified in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the inherited disease hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [19]. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations lead to pulmonary vascular change may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of SSc as well as of pulmonary arterial hypertension.Genes involved in autoimmunityThere have been many studies investigating genes for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in patients with SSc: several HLA genes have been weakly associated with SSc in different ethnic groups. Much stronger associations, however, have been observed with specific autoantibodies and/or disease subsets (reviewed by Tan and Arnett [20]). For example, anticentromere antibodies have been associated with HLA-DQB1 alleles [21], and antitopoisomerase antibodies, with an HLA-DRw11 allele as well as with a particular HLA-DQB1 sequence [22]. Anti-Th/To antibodies have also been associated with HLA-DR11, as well as with a reduced frequency of HLA-DR7, this latter association found also in patients with anticentromere antibodies [23]. These immunogenetic associations are thought to reflect T-cell involvement in autoimmunity.One of the most interesting novel hypotheses to be investigated in recent years is that SSc might result from a graft-versus-host reaction as a result of retained and persistent fetal cells in mothers – so-called microchimerism. This concept can be expanded to explain SSc in males, as the exchange of cells at birth can be two-way. The investigation of this hypothesis is technically difficult, because PCR contamination must be completely avoided. Both HLA and Y-chromosome sequences have been investigated, but from the results to date it is difficult to conclude that this concept is specific to SSc [24, 25]. This recent interest in microchimerism in the pathogenesis of SSc has extended to its link with HLA. Lambert et al. reported that persistent fetal microchimerism (in both healthy women and those with SSc) is associated with DQA1*0501 [26] and that this allele is associated with SSc in male patients [27]. These observations suggest that HLA may confer susceptibility to SSc via many different mechansims.Finally, on autoimmunity and the immune response, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has recently received considerable interest, because its actions can be blocked therapeutically. While an association between the microsatellite TNF-α13 and SSc has recently been reported in Japanese patients, the fact that TNF alleles are in linkage disequilibrium with HLA class II alleles reduced the importance of this association [28]."
4,"PReS-FINAL-2151: HLA B27/B7, TLR-4, NLRP3, CXCR4 AND PTPN12: the shared genetic master-key genes leading to development of undifferentiated spondyloarthritis/era in children","Enthestis related arthritis (era) represent an undifferentiated form of spondyloarthritis (spa), distinguishing it from other subtypes of JIA for optimum treatment and outcome, as well as for studies aimed at understanding genetic predisposition and pathogenesis. Majority of these studies focused on genome associations within MHC, only few searched for connections outside of this region and only some analyzed transcriptome of era patients. Our preliminary results of gene expression profiling in PBMC of 11 new onset and untreated patients diagnosed with era, identified 744 differentially expressed genes.",To validate results of gene expression analysis in groups of patients diagnosed with era and other subtypes of JIA.,"Based on extensive and diligent statistical analysis, ten genes (CXCR4, NLRP3, PTPRN2, TLR4, DUSP6, MAP2K2, MAPKBP1, MYST3, PTPN12, TNFSF4) were selected for further RT-PCR analysis in four groups of patients selected according to ILAR criteria (N = 56): untreated era patients with obtained expression profile (P1 = 11; 1 B7, 2 B27, 8 B7/B27), untreated era patients (P2 = 10; 2 B7, 6 B27), treated era patients (P3 = 24; 5 B7, 12 B27, 1 B7/B27) and treated JIA patients (P4 = 11). All groups were compared to healthy controls (N = 12). For all era patients HLA typing was preformed.","Statistically significant (p < 0.05) fold change (FC) was shown for CXCR4 (FC 1.89), TLR4 (FC 4.36), MAPKBP1 (FC -3.13) and PTPN12 (FC -3.70) in P1 group, CXCR4 (FC 1.87), NLRP3 (FC -5), PTPRN2 (FC -5.55), TLR4 (FC 3.91) and PTPN12 (FC -2.63) in P2 group, CXCR4 (FC 1.37), NLRP3 (FC -3.71), MAPKBP1 (FC -1.82), PTPN12 (FC -2.44) and TNFSF4 (FC -1.52) in P3 group and PTPN12 (FC -5) in P4 group."
5,Genetic epidemiology: Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterised by a striking preponderance in females, multisystem involvement, and autoantibodies directed primarily against nuclear antigens. Pathogenic mechanisms have been partly elucidated and defects in immune complex clearance, B-cell tolerance, and T-cell function have all been described. Little, however, is known about predisposing factors and mechanisms leading to disease induction. Through a variety of study designs, a strong genetic predisposition has been shown. For example, studies of affected probands estimate the sibling recurrence risk (λs) to be approximately 20. Twin studies have demonstrated concordance rates among monozygotic twins of 24-65%, compared with 2-9% in dizygotic twins [1]. SLE is a complex, polygenic trait with contributions from MHC and non-MHC genes, and up to 100 genes may be involved in disease susceptibility [1]. The study of SLE genetics is at an exciting and rapidly advancing stage. This review aims to update our current understanding of this area.","Genetic analyses in the mouse have provided some important insights into the pathogenic processes mediating disease in experimental models of SLE. Linkage analysis and congenic dissection have provided insights into the genetic basis for susceptibility in the classic lupus-prone mouse strains. These studies have delineated specific genetic pathways that are critical to the development of severe lupus nephritis and have identified allele-specific, suppressive modifiers capable of dramatically influencing disease progression. The 'synthesis' of mouse models of systemic autoimmunity via the production of targeted gene disruptions has also helped identify specific genes and gene combinations capable of causing and modifying disease.The chromosomal locations of genes mediating susceptibility to lupus nephritis or systemic autoimmunity in the NZB/W, MRL, and BXSB mouse models have been determined through genome scans [2,3,4,5]. These studies show that lupus susceptibility is inherited in a complex fashion involving both genetic interactions and additive effects of individual genes. In all, 31 different gene designations have been defined thus far, distributed among 21 nonoverlapping 20-cM genome intervals (Table 1). Other investigators have mapped loci affecting a variety of component phenotypes associated with systemic autoimmunity [6]. The genomic segments on murine chromosomes 1, 4, and 7 are associated with disease susceptibility in multiple strain combinations, suggesting that these intervals contain genes or gene clusters that strongly influence autoimmunity. The Sle1, Sle2, and Sle3 loci have been individually identified as the major SLE susceptibility loci in NZM2410 mice [2] and their immunophenotypes have been characterised. Sle1 mediates loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, Sle2 lowers the activation threshold of B cells, and Sle3 mediates dysregulation of CD4+ T cells [2]. The combination of Sle1 with any one of Sle2, Sle3, or Yaa (autoimmune accelerating gene) on the B6 genetic background results in the development of systemic autoimmunity with variably penetrant glomerulonephritis culminating in renal failure and death. In contrast, two-loci combinations of any of Sle2, Sle3, or Yaa did not mediate fatal disease. These results identify Sle1 as a strategic locus in SLE pathogenesis [7]. The NZW genome also has four epistatic modifiers, SLE suppressors (Sles1-Sles4), which suppress autoimmunity. The most potent, Sles1, switches off the Sle1 immunophenotype and can suppress the entire autoimmune pathological process [8]. Recent fine-mapping analysis of the Sle1 locus has identified a cluster of functionally related loci (Sle1a-d). These loci share a common pathway leading to loss of tolerance to chromatin but differ by various other serological and cellular phenotypes [9]. This potent susceptibility locus is syntenic with the 1q23-42 segment of the human chromosome.Table 1 Positions of the named susceptibility loci from murine genome studies involving NZB, NZW, NZM2410, BXSB, and MRL/lpr mice (Wakeland et al, 1999) [2].Full size tableOther models of intense interest are those supporting an apoptosis-related autoantigen clearance defect, for example C1q knockout, DNase1-deficient, and serum-amyloid-P-deficient mice. These models have shown several important pathogenic abnormalities, including reduced macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and increased concentrations of apoptotic bodies, in tissue samples associated with development of glomerulonephritis [10,11,12,13].","The traditional approach for locating a disease gene in humans is linkage analysis. Results from mouse models of SLE presented the first evidence for genetic linkage to an area of chromosome 1 in the mouse that is syntenic to human chromosome 1q23-42. In 1997, Tsao et al [14] published linkage evidence on the long arm of chromosome 1q41-42, using 43 families with 52 affected sibling pairs of mixed origin. Several additional linkage studies have been performed using sib-pairs and extended family pedigrees [15,16,17,18,19]. The parameters and test populations for each study as well as the genomic intervals detected in at least two mapping studies are summarised in Tables 2 and 3.Table 2 Summary of human linkage studies in systemic lupus erythematosusFull size tableTable 3 Human systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility loci identified in two or more mapping studiesFull size tableAs Table 2 shows, there are many sources of variation between these studies, including ethnic mix, sample size, specific markers used, and analytic models used. Another source of variation may relate to clinical phenotypes of the affected individuals. Localisation of genes with modest effects by linkage analysis is difficult and such variations may further limit the power of such studies. Despite these important limitations, there is some agreement as regards regions providing evidence of linkage. Several areas on chromosome 1 have been detected (1p36, 1q21-23 and 1q41-42) [15,16,17,18,19] that contain genes of immunological importance, some of which may have direct relevance to pathogenic processes in SLE (Table 4). The importance of using well-defined populations is emphasised by recent studies of Nordic multi-case families in which a susceptibility locus at chromosome 2q37 (SLEB2) has been reported [19]. A study of single-case Swedish families confirmed association with further markers in this region but, in contrast, there was no linkage to this area in 13 Mexican families [20].Table 4 Candidate genes for systemic lupus erythematosus at regions identified by linkage analysisFull size table","Many individual genes have been studied in SLE and a comprehensive analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review. Recent studies do, however, illustrate important points that are likely to apply to other genes in SLE.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerasePoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ('PARP') is involved in DNA repair and apoptosis, both of which may be of relevance in SLE pathogenesis. The gene for this protein is also within the area of linkage for SLE (1q41-42). Using a multiallelic approach using a transmission disequilibrium test, Tsao et al [21] found a significant association of an 85-bp allele of the gene for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in affected white patients with SLE. In contrast, Criswell et al [22] studied three separate cohorts of SLE patients and failed to confirm this association. Differences in statistical modelling may account for this difference and the original finding may be a false-positive result.Mannose-binding proteinThis protein has structural and functional similarities to C1q. Several polymorphisms of the protein have been described in association with SLE in different populations [23,24]. Recent evidence also suggests that polymorphisms of mannose-binding protein may increase susceptibility to infection in SLE [25].IL-6IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a role in B-cell maturation and IgG production. High IL-6 production is associated with a G→C polymorphism at -174 in the promoter region. In a study of 211 German patients with SLE, Schotte et al [26] found no higher prevalence of the G allele than in the background population. This allele was, however, associated with discoid cutaneous lesions and anti-histone antibodies.IL-10IL-10 is a Th2 cytokine that downregulates antigen presentation and immune complex clearance. IL-10 is increased in SLE patients and their family members. Lazarus et al [27] found the IL-10-1082G, IL-10-819C, and IL-10-592C haplotype was associated with Ro autoantibodies and renal involvement in white patients with SLE. In Chinese patients, a different haplotype was associated with renal disease but not Ro autoantibodies [28]. These studies found no association with disease susceptibility. In contrast, Gibson et al [29] found single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter region significantly associated with SLE susceptibility in African Americans.Tumour necrosis factor-aThe tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a gene lies within the MHC region on chromosome 6p. The HLA B8, DR3 haplotype has been associated with SLE in whites and confers a two- to threefold increased risk of SLE [1]. The TNF-α -308A polymorphism is located within the promoter region of the gene and is associated with increased production of TNF-α. This polymorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the HLA B8, DR3 haplotype, but it also has an independent effect in SLE [1,30]. In addition, Werth et al [31] have demonstrated an enhanced susceptibility to photosensitive cutaneous lesions in SLE patients with this polymorphism. However the TNF-a -308A polymorphism is also in linkage disequilibrium with other polymorphisms across the TNF-α locus, and the functional association remains to be established.Fc receptorsThese receptors play a role in handling of immune complexes as well as in clearance of apoptotic cells. The Fc IgG receptor FcγRII and FcγRIII genes are both located at 1q23-24, and several polymorphisms have been described that affect the ability of receptors to bind. In a prospective study of Hispanic patients with SLE, Zuniga et al [32] observed that the low-affinity FcγR alleles (RIIa-R131 and RIIIa-F176) were inherited independently and were present at higher frequency in patients with SLE, especially as a haplotype. In SLE patients with nephritis, there was also a predominance of low-affinity alleles. Hatta et al [33], studying a Japanese population, also found an association between FcγRIIIB-NA2/NA2 genotype and development of SLE with an increased prevalence of nephritis. Selgiman et al [34] also recently reported that the FcγRIIIA-158F allele is a risk factor for nephritis in white patients with SLE. The exact role of these 'low-affinity' polymorphisms in disease susceptibility and expression remains controversial and further work is needed to fully elucidate their role.These studies suggest that certain genetic defects (e.g. in complement, mannose-binding protein, and FcγR) associated with similar pathogenic mechanisms all can lead to susceptibility to SLE in different populations. The clinical expression of SLE, while diverse, may not be nearly as diverse as the range of genetic defects that may predispose to it. In addition, some genes not associated with susceptibility may nevertheless be important in phenotypic expression (e.g. those for IL-6, IL-10). In view of these observations, enriching populations with a particular phenotype might influence studies of susceptibility. Prospective studies will be important, both to accurately assess the association of certain markers with expression of disease and also to study the predictive value of genetic markers in defined populations."
