0,Function2Gene: A gene selection tool to increase the power of genetic association studies by utilizing public databases and expert knowledge,"Many common disorders have genetic components which convey increased susceptibility. While linkage and association analyses have been quite successful in identifying rare variants with high penetrance, such as in Huntington's disease [1] and some forms of cancer [2], the ability of these approaches to detect common variants with more modest effects (less penetrance) is limited. Frequent alleles with modest genetic effects play important roles in the susceptibility to most diseases. For example, most autoimmune disorders involve multiple alleles of different genes with individual low penetrance which also interact with environmental factors to produce the final disease phenotype. Dissecting the disease phenotype into the individual genes and associated alleles that are responsible is crucial for understanding the mechanism of the disease and ultimately developing treatment modalities [3].To this end, many researchers have been using genome-wide approaches to locate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in disequilibrium with a disease-causing allele, or associated with a disease phenotype [3]. Unfortunately, the requirement to completely scan the entire genome with sufficient SNP coverage required to achieve an appropriate study-wide power as well as the concomitant increase in number of subjects required to overcome the multiple-testing effect makes this type of study prohibitively expensive. Indeed, many association studies are under-powered, which leads to low reproducibility, compounded additionally by publication bias [4–7].There are two general methods to reduce the number of SNPs tested in a search for variants which convey susceptibility. The first is to reduce the number of SNPs necessary to cover the entire genome by maximizing the information conveyed by each individual SNP. This process involves the elimination of redundant SNPs whose state is already determined with high probability by other SNPs in the study [8, 9]. The second method is to use prior available information to select genes and genomic regions likely to be involved in a disease and testing the most likely genes and regions in preference to the least likely. While this approach does have advantages over a whole-genome study, specifically in financial cost, time required and a smaller number of subjects needed to assure reasonable power, it does have disadvantages in that it does not select candidate genes which are not associated with biological functions or genomic regions currently thought to be related or linked to a disease.In order to determine which genes or genomic regions are likely to be associated with the disease, it is necessary to connect genes and genomic areas with available literature on the disease and disease-associated pathways. The implementation we present here relies on experts to build a list of keywords and genomic areas from the available literature and expert knowledge coupled with publicly available databases to connect keywords and genomic areas to specific genes. An alternative using automated information extraction techniques which do not rely on expert knowledge is presented in the discussion. This experimental design, where the genes (and consequently, SNPs within those genes) are selected using prior available information allows for the determination of the prior probability that a particular gene is associated with a disease.Once specific genes have been selected, the SNPs used in the study need to be selected. A popular class of methods is the tagSNP methods, which attempt to reduce the number of SNPs while maximizing the information that each SNP represents by grouping SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium with each other and in the same phase (see [8, 9] for a comparison of different methods). The genes suggested by our program and its associated method do not necessarily require such powerful techniques, but discarding redundant SNPs will be useful in maximizing power while reducing cost. Beyond discarding non-informative SNPs, special importance should be placed on functional SNPs as they are more likely to actually represent the disease allele in question.The method presented here uses a combination of automated and manual approaches to maximize the power of a study using SNPs. The method has the following steps:

1.
Use expert knowledge and literature to identify a set of keywords (biological functions and genetic regions) which have high prior probability of being associated with the disease.


2.
Use publicly available databases to select genes that reference the set of keywords.


3.
Rank the identified genes based on their prior probability of association using the selection results and expert knowledge.


4.
Choose an appropriate number of genes for SNP selection and association studies based on the number of cases available, monetary, and time constraints of the study while maintaining acceptable study-wide power.


5.
Conduct study.


6.
Analyze results, optionally using the prior probability of association obtained during genetic selection.

","The application is separated into a series of separate scripts, each of which has a specific function, and operate in a specific order (see Figure 1).Figure 1Schematic of the gene selection process. Flow chart of the separate methodology and the scripts which enact the methodology, as described in the introduction and implementation sections.Full size imageOnce a set of keywords (biological functions and genomic locations judged to be associated or otherwise involved with the disease) has been identified by expert knowledge of the disease in question, publicly available databases (currently NCBI, GeneCards, and Harvester are defaults, but Uniprot and Ensembl are also supported) are queried in series with delays between each query as appropriate for each database to avoid overloading them. Because there is no well documented common interchange format for these databases, the get_series of scripts download the HTML (or XML) which the search requests generate and save it. To avoid putting unreasonable demands on the databases, the get_scripts limits the number of requests they make per minute.After all of the HTML (or XML) has been retrieved, the next series of scripts (parse_) are run which use the HTML::Parse (or XML::Parser::Expat) module to extract the gene name, accession number for the reference sequence, genomic location, alias(es), function(s), and description.These files are then combined into a single file by combine_results that tracks what database and keyword resulted in which genes. The aliases from all databases are joined. Gene descriptions are retrieved from each database; the longest description is retained in the final list. For example, Harvester, when queried with ""adhesion"", returns VCAM1 (amongst others). Harvester also returns VCAM1 when queried with ""inflammation"". GeneCards also returns VCAM1 for these two queries. combine_results would then indicate that GeneCards returned VCAM1 twice, Harvester returned VCAM1 twice, and it was returned for ""adhesion"" and ""inflammation"". At the same time three separate weighting procedures are applied to order the genes. First, a simple approach, dubbed ""rzscore"", simply counts the number of times that a gene was returned by unique search terms, and orders the results from most number of term matches to least. The second, allows user-specified weights to be applied to each keyword, and orders the results by the sum of the weights of the corresponding keywords which returned a result. The third method automatically weights the keywords to avoid over-counting keywords which are entirely subsets of other keywords. It does this by dividing the number of results returned by a keyword by the sum of the number of results returned by that keyword and any other keyword, including itself.To facilitate easier use of this collection of meta-search utilities, a script which binds them all together has also been provided, called function2gene, which takes a set of keywords, an optional set of databases to query, and returns the complete tabulated results to the specified directory.By using perl and existing modules (WWW::Mechanize, HTML::TreeBuilder and XML::Parser) the actual number of lines (and resulting implementational complexity) of the codebase is greatly reduced, as custom code to deal with form submission as well as HTML and XML parsing did not need to be written. This approach also allows the scripts to be slightly less dependent on the exact output format of the sites which are searched. Splitting the retrieval and parse stages also allows for extracting additional information from the search results by modifying the parser and reparsing the results without waiting to retrieve results from the remote databases again.","The system described above was utilized to generate a list of genes which were then used to select SNPs in a study of childhood-onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a debilitating multi-system autoimmune disorder affecting ≈ 0.1% of the North American population. An initial search using a set of 31 keywords (consisting of biological functions and chromosomal regions) selected by expert knowledge returned 6798 genes with various contributions from the three databases used (Table 1). It is important to note that the results obtained are temporally-sensitive; as databases are updated different sets of genes will be returned. In every case a single database did not retrieve all the genes found by other databases, demonstrating the need to query multiple databases. The substantial contribution made by each database in identifying the candidate genes demonstrates that each of the databases is required to maximize the number of candidate genes discovered, though there are likely results which are still not captured by the set of databases queried. As new databases come into prominence, Function2Gene can be extended to query them as well. The top 1204 genes (of which 836 were returned by GeneCards, 699 by Harvester, and 135 by NCBI) were used to select 9412 SNPs. The number of genes to select was dictated by the capacity of the chip (≈ 10,000 SNPs), and a decision to have approximately ten SNPs per gene on average. The choice of SNPs to genotype within the selected genes was based on available information from databases including the Human Haplotype Mapping Project (HapMap) with priority given to SNPs with high heterozygosity in two or more relevant ethnicities and to SNPs representing amino acid coding variants. The selected SNPs were then cross-checked against the accumulated SNP validation test results available at our industrial collaborator (ParAllele Biosciences), an active participant of the International HapMap project.Table 1 Results of gene selection processFull size tableUsing the selected SNPs, 251 nuclear families consisting of both parents and the affected child (full trios) were genotyped. The analysis of the genotypes of the 251 trios using Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) followed by False Discovery Rate (FDR) multi-test correction yielded 9 noteworthy genes, that are associated with SLE with FDR less than 0.5; two of these genes were highly significant, with FDR less than 0.05 [10].Using Bayesian methodologies, the impact of pre-existing knowledge of a disease on the discovery of genes associated with the disease can be increased, as the posterior probability of association with the disease can be modified in accordance with its prior probability as reported by function2gene. The False Positive Report Probability (FPRP) measure is one such method which uses the prior probability of association, which can be calculated from the results of the keyword-based gene selection, to modify the posterior probability of association.

One method of calculating prior probability based on the keyword based gene selection is to order the SNPs according to number of times they were returned by different keywords, taking into account the biological relevance of the SNP, and then apply a continuous function such that the higher ranked SNPs have a greater prior probability of association than the lower ranked SNPs, and the sum of the probability of association is the prior estimate of the total number of SNPs in the search believed to be associated with the disease. An alternative method is to order the SNPs in the same manner, and then place them in to different groups, assigning the same prior probabilities to each SNP in a group while controlling the sum of the prior probabilities assigned. For example, assuming 10,000 SNPs, 10 of which are believed to be associated, assign priors of π = 0.025 for the top 1%, 6.25 × 10-3 to the next top 4%, 1.25 × 10-3 to the next top 20%, and 3.33 × 10-4 to the remaining 75%. In this manner the multiple testing effect is controlled while maximizing the effect of the prior available information. Applying FPRP [11] to the results of the TDT test with a prior assumption of 8 associated SNPs yielded 12 noteworthy genes, including all 9 obtained with the FDR corrections, and the same two significant genes [10].An existing web-based program which is functionally similar to the methodology presented here is the Disease Candidate Gene search of SNPs3d. Using the keywords chosen by SNPs3d for three diseases, diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer disease, we have compared the results obtained by SNPs3d and Function2Gene in Table 2. The majority of high ranking genes returned by SNPs3d are also returned by Function2Gene, but Function2Gene returns a far greater number of genes.Table 2 Comparison of Function2Gene and SNPs3dFull size tableFuture advancements of the approach presented here could be made by the use of more powerful literature mining techniques which would reduce (or even eliminate) the need for expert information on the nature, pathology, and biology of the disease to generate a list of keywords and discard spurious results. Such approaches would also reduce the reliance of this approach on the contents of stewarded fields in the databases, enabling novel associations as well as incorrect associations to be discerned. For example, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction (RE) could be used in tandem to elucidate connections between diseases and genes directly. NER identifies biologically-relevant entities (like genes and proteins) from literature using techniques such as hidden Markov models and dictionaries. Once entities have been identified, RE can identify the relationship and/or connection between entities using the proximity of entities (and the re-occurrence of entities in close proximity), along with rule base systems and full predicate/subject grammars [12–14]. It would then be possible to walk the relationship tree, using the probabilities between each node of the tree connecting specific genes and a disease (with intervening genes, proteins, and biological pathways in between), and then ordering the resultant genes by the probability of their connection which should be directly proportional to the prior probability of association.","The use of available prior information to decrease the size of the problem space for gene identification in complex polygenic disorders is an as yet underutilized technique. The methodology and the programs presented here use data mining techniques to retrieve from a few databases a number of genes with high prior probability of being associated with the disease. The program also allows to order genes by relevance, thereby allowing the problem space to be greatly reduced, increasing the power of the study and thus increasing the likelihood of successfully finding associated genes."
1,"APOL1 genetic variants, chronic kidney diseases and hypertension in mixed ancestry South Africans","In 2008, through admixture-mapping linkage-disequilibrium genome scan, two landmark studies identified a risk locus on chromosome 22q12.3 which explained the increased burden of nondiabetic end­stage renal disease (ESRD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in individuals of recent African ancestry [1, 2]. These studies provided evidence that genetic variation on the myosin­9 gene (MYH9) conferred most or nearly all of the increased risk for nondiabetic kidney disease in African Americans [1, 2]. However, subsequent reanalysis of chromosome 22q12.3 region utilizing the 1000 Genome Project, identified genetic variants in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) which extended beyond MYH9 [3, 4]. These are located 14kbp downstream from the 3’end of MYH9 and the strongest significant association with ESRD was found in a 10-kb region in the last exon of APOL1 [3, 4]. Of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, two were nonsynonymous (rs73885139 and rs60910145) designated G1, and one a 6-bp deletion (rs71785313) termed G2. The two missense variants are in almost absolute linkage disequilibrium while the G2 is in complete negative linkage disequilibrium with G1.The APOL1 is known for its lytic effects on trypanosomes, which cause sleeping sickness in humans [5]. However, one of the Tryanosoma species (T. brucei rhodesiense) overcomes the lytic effects of APOL1 by expressing a serum resistance-associated protein (SRA) [6]. The presence of G1 and G2 polymorphisms in the SRA binding domain are believed to restore the APOL1 ability to kill T. brucei rhodesiense [7], hence the positive selection of the variants in endemic regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Variation in frequency is substantial within Africa; and therefore the contribution to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is likely to vary [4, 7]. However, at this time the geographic variation in APOL1 association with CKD is unknown, since it has not yet been tested. Therefore, herein, we sought to determine the frequency of APOL1 variants and their association with CKD traits in a South African population with an African ancestry, high prevalence of CKD and poor cardiovascular risk profile.","Two hundred and thirty nine (27.8 %) participants had diabetes and their general characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The overall mean age was 53.1 years, with significant differences between those with and without diabetes (51.0 vs. 58.7 years, p < 0.0001). The eGFR was significantly lower in individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes as well as in women vs. men (all p < 0.0001), whilst systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were significantly elevated in men (both p ≤ 0.016).Table 1 Baseline characteristics by diabetes status and genderFull size table
The frequency distributions, both genotype and allele, did not differ significantly according to gender and diabetes status. Deletion of the sequence TTATTA of rs71785313 was borderline more frequent in women than in men (6.3 % vs. 3.8 %, p = 0.065), (Table 2). The concomitance of two-risk alleles was observed in 9 individuals (1.01 %) whilst 143 (16.6 %) had one-risk allele (Table 3). In participants with two-risk alleles, serum creatinine was elevated with a corresponding reduction of eGFR (either MDRD or CKD-EPI based) than in those with only one-risk allele or none, but differences did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, these were still more likely to have higher prevalence of hypertension (Table 3).Table 2 Genotype distributions, minor allele frequencies, and unadjusted p-values for comparing genotype distributions according to diabetes status and genderFull size table
Table 3 Baseline characteristics by allele combinationFull size table
In a recessive model adjusted for age, sex, diabetes status and hypertension, the G1 risk alleles showed a borderline association with prevalent CKD (CKD-EPI), p = 0.047 (Table 4). On the other hand, in generalized linear and logistics regression models (dominant and log-additive genetic models) adjusted for age, sex, diabetes status and hypertension, none of the genotypes was associated with serum creatinine, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio or prevalent CKD (Table 5 and 6). These genetic models revealed an association between G2 (rs71785313) and systolic blood pressure (both p ≤ 0.025), with a significant statistical interaction by diabetes status, p = 0.025, reflecting a negative non-significant effect in nondiabetics and a positive effect in diabetics.Table 4 Generalized linear and logistic regression models showing the effects of genes on kidney functions and other continuous predictors (recessive model)Full size table

","This study aimed to determine the frequency of the two APOL1 risk alleles (G1 and G2) and their association with renal traits in a general South African mixed ancestry population. The findings from this study show that 16.6 % of the participants carried at least one APOL1 risk allele. The G1 risk alleles, rs73885319 and rs60910145 were observed respectively in, 3.6 %, 3.4 % of individuals whilst G2 risk allele carriers were 5.8 %, resulting in a 1.01 % frequency of the APOL1 two-risk allele (G1:G1 or G1:G2 or G2:G2). The presence of two-risk alleles decreased eGFR and the G1 risk alleles showed a borderline association with prevalent CKD (CKD-EPI), p = 0.047. On one hand, the G2 leaned towards an association with systolic blood pressure (p ≤ 0.025), with a significant statistical interaction by diabetes status, p = 0.025 assuming either dominant or log-additive. Our findings in the context of a small sample could also reflect the inadequate statistical power for uncovering some significant associations.The strong association between APOL1 and non-diabetic kidney diseases has been replicated in several studies [8–11] since the initial observations reported in African Americans with hypertensive kidney disease and FSGS [3, 4]. This risk is mostly conferred by the presence of two copies of the risk alleles, that is, homozygous or compound heterozygous compared to no or one APOL1 risk variant [3, 4]. In our study, the frequency of the two-risk allele was much lower than that reported in African Americans (13 %) [12], and it was borderline associated with CKD or its markers. Furthermore, carriers of the two-risk allele were more likely to have hypertension. Our findings may be attributed to the non-discriminatory nature of our study in which diabetic and non-diabetic kidney diseases were not analyzed separately and would have resulted in an even smaller number of CKD cases. Nevertheless, our study does provide an indication that APOL1 variants may play a role in conferring a poor renal disease and cardiovascular risk profile in this population. In linear genetic regression models, the G2 risk allele was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure. Emerging data point to an expanding role of APOL1 genetic aberrations implying that they are not limited to kidney diseases, but are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [13]. In two cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), the APOL1 two-risk allele increased by two-fold the risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and therapeutic surgical or endovascular interventions in African Americans [13]. Furthermore, APOL1 G2 homozygous individuals were shown to be at an increased risk for stroke compared to G1 two risk alleles [13].Although the link between hypertension and CKD is well established, CKD progression is augmented in African Americans compared to their Caucasian counterparts with similar blood pressure control [14, 15]. The APOL1 risk variants have recently been suggested to be the missing link in the accelerated progression of hypertensive CKD despite adequate blood pressure control in African Americans [16]. In the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension comprising 693 black patients with hypertensive CKD, Parsa et al. [16] used a codominant genetic model to show that patients with the APOL1 two-risk allele had a 2-fold risk of doubling their serum creatinine from baseline or developing incident end-stage renal disease over a 9-year period of follow-up. Furthermore, the progression of CKD in these patients was independent of blood pressure control [16]. The mechanism by which APOL1 risk variants contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertensive CKD has not been elucidated. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested including a role in lipid metabolism since APOL1 is mainly bound to high density lipoprotein [17], and variations in APOL1 circulating levels have been associated with its genetic variants [18, 19]. Another hypothesis relates to the localization of APOL1 protein in kidney vascular endothelium [20, 21]. In view of these studies including ours, a functional role of APOL1 in vasculorpathology, hypertension and kidney disease is worth exploring.The predominance of APOL1 variants in Africans and populations with an African ancestry is linked to a natural selection, as they protect against trypanosomal infection [5] from a species that is endemic in certain regions of Africa [22]. Another factor is the differing risk of non-diabetic kidney diseases. One example is a study conducted in an Ethiopian population without HIV-associated nephropathy, which showed an absence of the APOL1 G1 and G2 risk alleles [4, 23]. In comparison with other populations from Africa, the frequencies of APOL1 risk alleles are relatively similar [4, 8] except those in Western African populations [4, 9–11]. Since the Cape region of South Africa is far south of the tsetse fly belt, the moderate frequency of the APOL1 risk alleles is likely due to the African ancestry reported in this population [24].There are some limitations to be accounted for in the interpretation of our findings. These include a low number of participants with advanced stage CKD, in spite of our large sample, which may have resulted in a reduced statistical power to uncover significant associations. Although other studies from Africa did include patients with advanced CKD, and were consequently adequately powered to capture significant effects of genes on the disease risk, these studies have however used small sample sizes to provide reliable estimates of the frequencies of those gene variants in the general population as we have done. Our study comprised participants with CKD of various etiologies that could have been either diabetic or non-diabetic. Findings could therefore be different if the study was based on a population with a more homogenous type of CKD. Our study was also limited by the heterogeneous nature of the study population, which is of mixed genetic origin with contributions from Europeans, South Asians, Indonesians and a population genetically close to the isiXhosa sub-Saharan Bantu [24], necessitating the use of ancestry informative markers to account for population stratification. Potential population stratification in an unrelated sample is known to cause spurious positive or negative associations in population-based association studies if not accounted for. However, due to financial constraints, this analysis was not conducted, raising the possibility that population admixture interfered with the association analysis. The renal disease markers were based on a single measurement in a cross-sectional study design. The cross-sectional nature of our study precludes drawing causal inferences on the direction of the associations.","In conclusion, our study provides evidence that genetic variants in APOL1 are present in a mixed-ancestry South African population, but their association with renal diseases needs further exploration in patients with non-diabetic kidney diseases."
2,"Genetic, environmental and stochastic factors in monozygotic twin discordance with a focus on epigenetic differences","The extent to which phenotypic traits are heritable has been a subject of scientific interest, at least since Galton's classic twin study design [1]. Twins offer a unique means to study inheritance. Monozygotic (MZ) twins arise from a single zygote, and have always been thought to inherit identical genomic sequences [1], whereas dizygotic (DZ) twins arise from two different zygotes and, just like siblings, share on average 50% identity in their genomic sequence. To assess the relative contribution of genes to a trait, comparisons are made between MZ and DZ twin concordance, with a greater MZ than DZ concordance rate implicating a role for genetics in determining the trait [1]. Phenotypic discordance between MZ twins has traditionally been ascribed to non-shared environmental exposures [2]; however, recent research highlights this as being too simplified an explanation. In this review, we focus on potential sources of MZ discordance.","There is a range of early environmental factors that need to be considered as potential explanations for MZ twin discordance. In some studies, similar pre-natal and post-natal conditions, for example a shared in utero environment or upbringing in one family, have been thought to promote phenotypic concordance, in contrast to non-shared exposures [2, 3]. However, the concept of non-shared environment has important practical limitations. It is difficult to unambiguously identify the distinct factors and explain their differential effects on phenotype [3]. For instance, although MZ twins share a single uterus in multifetal pregnancies, they do not necessarily share a common in utero environment. Twinning itself is thought to be a rare malformation and a stochastic event, although there exists evidence for familiality [1, 4, 5]. MZ twins occur in about 3.5 in 1000 pregnancies or 4 in 1000 live births [6, 7]. Depending on the time of zygote splitting, MZ twins can be divided into four groups[1]. If the zygote splits within 3 days, the twins are dichorionic and diamniotic (DC DA) (18 to 36% of all MZ births). If splitting occurs after the third but before the seventh day, the twins are monochorionic but diamniotic (60 to 80% of cases) [1, 8]. If division occurs between days 7 and 14, the twins are monochorionic and monoamniotic (MC MA), which accounts for 2 to 4% of all MZ twins[8]. Conjoined twins arise when splitting happens after the days 13 or 14 [1, 8]. All multifetal pregnancies are more prone to complications (such as fetal malnutrition, growth restriction, and premature birth), with a mortality rate six times higher than for singletons, and a shorter average duration of twin pregnancy (35 weeks) [4, 9–17]. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common issue in twin pregnancies, affecting 12 to 47% of all twin pairs [18]. It often leads to discordance in birth weight [18–20], and has been linked with discordance for a range of phenotypes, including height, head circumference, intelligence, language comprehension and expression, fine motor performance, balance, coordination, and visual-motor perception [18, 20, 21].The potential causes of IUGR include genetic predisposition, in utero crowding, uneven allocation of blastomeres, uneven blood supply, and placental dysfunction (for example, placental abruption, infarcts, stem vessel thrombosis, velamentous insertion of the cord, and single umbilical artery) [18, 19, 21–23]. Some of these events, such as unequal division of blastomeres or uneven vascularization of the placenta, can be considered as non-shared early exposures, which can be classified, depending on the adopted definition, as environmental or stochastic. IUGR is even more pronounced in MC twins, for whom differences in placental sharing and vascularization lead to occasional unequal blood and nutrient sharing, and, in about 15% of MC diamniotic pregnancies, result in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) [6, 18, 21]. MC twins have a higher incidence of congenital heart disorders, and TTTS increases this risk even further [6]. However, even in the absence of TTTS, MC twins are seven times more likely to develop congenital heart disease, and this usually occurs in one twin only [5–7, 13, 21, 24]. The higher risk nature of multiple pregnancies, their proclivity towards complications, and the twin-twin competition for maternal resources increases the probability of a skewed environment affecting the twins in utero [25, 26].After birth, any non-shared environmental exposure, such as diet, smoking, toxin exposure and infection, may contribute towards twin discordance [2, 3, 22, 27–31]. Moreover, early phenotypic differences arising in twins could potentially cause shared exposures to have different effects, leading to dissimilarity between the twins.","It has been assumed that MZ twins are genetically identical, but a wealth of data are accumulating to show that this is not necessarily the case. Mosaicism for de novo mutations, retrotranspositions, indels, duplications, and chromosomal rearrangements may play a role in MZ twin discordance [32–44]. The rate for de novo base substitutions has been estimated at about 10-8 per base pair per generation, making some genetic differences between adult twins likely [45]. Postzygotic point mutations have been found to be the source of MZ twin discordance in oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome, Van der Woude syndrome, Darier's disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1 while mosaicism for chromosomal abnormalities has been implicated in discordance for conditions such as Turner syndrome, trisomy 21, trisomy 13, skin pigmentation, and sex phenotypes [46–51]. Postzygotic karyotypic mosaicism caused by faulty mitotic division has also been reported in cases of Ulrich-Turner syndrome [22].Copy number variants (CNVs), which account for a major portion of the genome, are strongly polymorphic and relatively unstable, with mutation rates 100 to 10 000 times higher than those for single base substitutions[52]. Phenotypic discordance in MZ twins may in part be caused by de novo mutations of CNVs and CNV mosaicism [32, 34, 36, 53]. Indeed, it has been indicated that de novo CNVs may occur at a rate of 10% per twinning event; however, studies have so far failed to link CNV mosaicism to any specific case of phenotypic discordance in MZ twins [40, 54–56].Additionally, unequal exchange of cells during gestation might potentially lead to discordant fetomaternal microchimerism [22].","Some variation is inevitable as a result of transcriptional or translational stochasticity, entailed by the random movements of molecules and the complexity of their interactions [57–63]. It should be expected that such noise can lead to markedly different effects under identical environmental conditions [64]. The effect of developmental stochasticity might amass in a drift-like fashion, and thus be more relevant to discordance in complex polygenic traits such as height or weight, which develop over long periods [58]. Stochastic events such as unequal division of the inner mass cells during twinning, or unequal allocation of the developmental markers or precursor cells to different somatic lineages, have been reported as potential sources of discordance in MZ twins [5, 37]. Certain cases of twin discordance might potentially be stochastic in origin, however because the causal mechanisms are not thoroughly understood, it is difficult to separate these from environmental effects and gene-environment interactions. Examples include discordance for eye or hair colour and fingerprint profiles, cases of mirror twinning (affecting up to 25% of MZ twins), and major malformations [22].Certain cases of differential allelic expression (DAE), which result in random monoallelic gene expression, arising as a result of X-inactivation or allelic exclusion in olfactory and pheromone receptor genes, can constitute a mechanism for stochastically driven phenotypic discordance in MZ twins [22, 65–70]. Although DAE has also been estimated to affect about 50% of autosomal genes in B-cells, the evidence from MZ twins indicates that the overall degree of DAE is to a certain extent under genetic control. with an estimated 30% of the affected genes showing significant correlation between co-twins [71]. The precise estimates of DAE and its concordance in MZ twins vary. A comprehensive whole genome expression experiment conducted by Baranzini et al. indicated that only 1.9% of heterozygous coding loci showed significant evidence for DAE, but out of these, 57% were concordant between the co-twins, still leaving room for stochastic effects [72]; however, their findings were based on a single MZ twin pair [72]."
3,Clinical and genetic characterization of a Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome patient born to diseased parents,"Neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, which is also known as Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome (CDS; MIM 275630), is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by the intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG) in numerous tissues [1, 2]. The clinical phenotype involves multiple organs and systems, including skin, liver, skeletal muscle, eyes, ears, and the central nervous system. However, in this syndrome, the degree of systemic involvement is quite variable [2,3,4,5]. ABHD5 (α/β hydrolase domain 5), a cofactor for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), has been identified as a causative gene of CDS [6]. Indeed, different ABHD5 mutations determine the partial or total loss of ATGL activation, leading to the accumulation of TG inside lipid droplets [2,3,4,5]. Lipid droplets are highly dynamic and ubiquitous cellular organelles. These droplets are a fundamental component of lipid homeostasis, i.e., a universal feature of eukaryotic cells that can ensure a rapidly mobilized lipid source for numerous biochemical processes [7]. Neutral lipids also accumulate in oocytes and blastomeres as lipid droplets, providing energy for mammalian embryo preimplantation, proper growth and development [8].In the peripheral leukocytes of CDS patients, neutral lipids inside lipid droplets are easily detectable with standard or specific stains, and they are known as Jordan’s anomalies, the most common laboratory findings of the disease [9].One hundred and twenty-eight CDS patients have been reported worldwide (Additional file 1: Table S1). For 85 of these patients, clinical diagnosis has been confirmed by ABHD5 mutation analysis. The highest number of CDS patients (27 cases) has been described in Turkey, mainly due to the high incidence of consanguineous marriages [10]. Nevertheless, the clinical and genetic description of families in which both parents and children are affected by CDS has never been reported before.","Here, we present a CDS Turkish family with four affected members (Fig. 1a, III-1, III-2, IV-1, IV-2). The child (IV-1) was an 8-year-old male born at 38 weeks of gestation and weighing 3400 g. He presented lamellar ichthyosis at birth. At first examination (at the age of 5), he had lagophthalmos and ectropion. Ophthalmologists did not record lagophthalmos in subsequent examinations, so the condition was considered a compliance problem. He had elevated transaminase (ALT: 75 U/L; normal 5-35 U/L; GGT 31 U/L; normal 5-17 U/L), creatine phosphokinase (CK: 1677 U/L; normal 22-200 U/L), triglyceride (460 mg/dl; normal 35-130 mg/dl), and total cholesterol levels (135 mg/dl; normal 110-200 mg/dl) (Table 1). Systemic examination revealed 2 cm hepatomegaly. Abdominal ultrasonography was compatible with hepatosteatosis and hepatomegaly. Electromyographic examination revealed signs of myopathy.Fig. 1Pedigree of CDS family (a).

Both presented lamellar ichthyosis, ectropion, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatomegaly and hepatosteatosis (Table 1). In both parents and the child, dermatological examination revealed widespread ichthyosis on the facial region, trunk, extensor and flexural regions and scalp. The individual scales over the trunk were white, fine, translucent and semi-adherent, whereas those on the limbs and face were grey-brown, larger in size, polygonal and adherent (Fig. 2). No bullous lesions or erosions were noted. The involvement of palms and soles, dental anomaly and nail dystrophy was absent.Fig. 2Dermatological characterization of CDS patients. Lamellar ichthyosis affecting facial region (a, d, e, g), trunk (b, c, f, h), and extremities (i) of child (patient IV-1; a, b, c), father (patient III-2; d), mother (patient III-1; e, f) and cousin (patient IV-2; g, h, i). Prominent eyelid ectropion in father (d) and mother (e)Full size imageIn the 5-year-old girl (IV-2), ichthyosis was also present in flexural regions (Fig. 2). Corrugated appearance and hyperpigmented scales were detected on foot, back, knee, and elbow. Laboratory investigation revealed increased ALT (86 U/L) (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminase) (88 U/L) and CK (1145 U/L) levels (Table 1). Electromyographic examination revealed myopathy. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosteatosis causing hepatomegaly. Ophthalmological and audiological examinations were normal.A peripheral blood smear stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa revealed lipid vacuoles (Jordan’s anomaly) in leucocytes from all patients (Fig. 1b). After obtaining informed consent and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles, the coding regions of the ABHD5 gene were sequenced, and a homozygous N209X mutation was identified (Fig. 1c). For molecular analysis, oligonucleotides were selected to amplify and sequence the seven exons of ABHD5, their intron/exon boundaries, and the candidate promoter regions. The primer sequences and the amplification conditions were previously reported [2]. A few days after molecular diagnosis, the father died of a heart attack at the age of 44. He had no prior cardiac history. However, PNPLA2 gene analysis was performed, excluding disease-causing mutations.The CARE guidelines were followed in this case.","The N209X mutation identified in our CDS family is the most common in the Turkish CDS population. Nur et al. compared clinical findings between patients carrying this mutation with other ABHD5 variations and noted no significant differences [10]. In CDS patients, skin involvement is prevalent and a consistently observed clinical feature, consisting of a non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Sano et al. demonstrated that the severity of ichthyosis positively correlates with TG level in the scales from patients [11]. In our affected subjects, a widespread lamellar ichthyosis detected since birth revealed a homogeneous CDS phenotype. Notably, skin involvement did not appear more severe in the child; however, it is possible to hypothesize increased accumulation of TG in ectodermal cells during embryonic development. Liver abnormalities can occur in greater than 80% of patients, ranging from hepatomegaly or liver steatosis to cirrhosis, and can be observed in young children, as occurred in this family [4, 6]. Neurological impairment was not detected in our patients; however, intellectual disability has been reported in 20% of CDS subjects and in approximately 40% of those carrying the N209X mutation [10,11,12]. Sensorineural hearing loss was not present in our family; however, this condition occurs in 30% of CDS patients. Muscle involvement was evident only in the two children. Clinically, the children did not exhibit significant muscle weakness, fatigue or exercise intolerance. However, an electromyographic examination (EMG) was performed because of an elevation in CK levels and revealed a myopathic pattern. In CDS, muscle abnormalities have been detected in 40% of subjects. Myopathy typically begins in the thirties, but it has also been described in very young children [2, 13].In conclusion, we describe a family in which all members are affected by CDS. When the child was born, his mother was 36 years old. She did not indicate any infertility problems or history of abortion. This paper describes the unique reported case of natural conception and pregnancy between two CDS patients. No particular pregnancy complications were observed. Therefore, the storage of neutral lipids inside lipid droplets did not dramatically increase during oocyte maturation. Indeed, embryo development and foetal growth were not affected. To date, the child does not present new symptoms or an exacerbation of the clinical phenotype even with regard to dermatologic manifestations compared with the symptoms and phenotypes of his relatives or other CDS patients. Instead, a relevant aspect for these three patients seems to be represented by the psychogenic stress due to isolation from society, colleagues, school friends and relatives. Finally, after molecular diagnosis, the two children immediately started a special diet, poor in fatty acids with medium chain triglycerides (MCT), as hepatic and dermatologic improvement has been reported in different cases consuming such a diet.","
