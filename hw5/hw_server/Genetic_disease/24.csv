0,Gene expression endophenotypes: a novel approach for gene discovery in Alzheimer's disease,"It is well established that the risk for many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)[1, 2], Parkinson's disease (PD)[2, 3], frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)[4, 5] is under substantial genetic control. Identification of deterministic mutations with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance in familial forms of these diseases has led to significant progress in our understanding of their underlying pathophysiology. Nonetheless, such monogenic forms constitute only a fraction of these conditions (e.g. < 1% of all AD[1], 5-10% of all PD[2]); and risk for most neurodegenerative diseases, like other common diseases/traits, is thought to arise from multiple genetic variants and their interaction with each other, as well as environmental factors. Whereas investigation of large families with Mendelian inheritance patterns, using linkage followed by sequence analyses have generally proven useful in gene discoveries for monogenic forms of neurodegenerative diseases[1, 5], association studies in unrelated case-control series have emerged as a more viable strategy in the common, multigenic and complex forms of these conditions[1–3]. The relative lack of success from candidate gene association studies coupled with technologic advances led to the emergence of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as a promising approach in gene discovery for common, complex diseases/traits with heterogeneous and multigenic underpinnings.The past several years have witnessed an explosion of GWAS that survey hundreds of thousands of genetic variants across the whole genome for association with disease risk in a hypothesis-independent manner. The recent widespread use of this approach became possible with the generation of a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome as part of the International HapMap Project[6, 7]. This effort combined with the technological advances in high-throughput genotyping allowed for the production of chips that contain up to 1 million SNPs which provide information about most (but not all) of the common genetic variation (usually defined as having a minor allele frequency > 0.05) in the genome by tagging (marking) the un-genotyped SNPs through LD. GWAS emerged based on the underlying ""common disease-common variant"" hypothesis which posits that the risk for many common diseases such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and AD is conferred by multiple common variants [8]. This approach proved to be successful in the discovery of candidate risk variants or regions for many common diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases[1–3].It became evident from these studies that although GWAS have identified numerous genetic loci for common diseases, they fell short of accounting for all of the genetic component of these conditions[8, 9]. The reasons for this have been discussed in recent reviews[8, 9] and include a) modest power of GWAS that utilize disease phenotype given relatively small effect sizes of risk variants, genetic heterogeneity of the disease (different disease risk variants at play in different subjects), and heterogeneity of the populations (different extent of LD); b) presence of rare disease risk variants or structural variants (such as insertions and deletions) that are not captured by the GWAS SNP platforms, c) presence of gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions that are yet unexplored.The SNPs identified through GWAS may reside near genes with no known or disease-relevant function. Some disease-associating variants may reside in LD regions harboring multiple genes, making it impossible to discern the true disease-risk gene. These represent relative weaknesses of GWAS resulting in part from the hypothesis-independent nature of this approach. On the contrary, this may also be perceived as a relative strength, since it may allow for the discovery of unexpected genes that would have been missed with a hypothesis-based approach. Nevertheless, the plethora of loci identified through GWAS need both functional confirmation and characterization, since their roles in disease risk are usually not inherently obvious.Multiple different approaches are proposed to overcome these shortcomings of GWAS that are beyond the scope of this review. One of the proposed approaches involves the use of biologically relevant, quantitative phenotypes (endophenotypes) for discovery and characterization of disease risk genes[8, 9]. This review focuses on gene expression levels as a potentially powerful group of endophenotypes and discusses the endophenotype concept, the evidence in support of a substantial genetic component for human gene expression, the GWAS examples that combine disease phenotype and expression endophenotypes, the use of gene expression endophenotype in the Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disease literature to-date and future directions.","The term ""endophenotype"" was first introduced in 1966 in the context of Drosophila genetics to contrast the phenotypes that are ""obvious and external"" (i.e. exophenotypes) with those that are ""microscopic and internal"" (i.e. endophenotypes)[10]. The term was applied in psychiatric genetics in the 1970s, specifically in schizophrenia genetics to describe molecular outcomes of gene activity, which lead to disease[11]. It was not until the 21st century that this term reached more widespread usage, mainly in psychiatric genetics initially, but subsequently also in other complex conditions such as neurodegenerative[12, 13], cardiovascular[14] and atopic [15] diseases. That the endophenotype approach was first advocated in psychiatric disorders partly stems from the need to have objectively quantifiable phenotypes associated with disease to avoid the imprecise and therefore heterogeneous nature of psychiatric diagnostic criteria[16], which is thought to contribute to the failure of genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. In a hypothetical construct that defines genotype-disease relationship, endophenotypes were proposed as quantitative phenotypes that are intermediate between genes and the disease outcome, that are directly influenced by a smaller number of genes than the disease phenotype, and that represent one of many facets of a disease[17]. Thus, another premise for this approach is the assumption that the underlying genetic architecture of the endophenotype will be simpler than that of the disease phenotype[17], though this may clearly not be the case[16]. Nevertheless, their closer proximity to gene action could lead to greater ""genetic signal-to-noise"" ratios[17, 18], which may translate into larger effect sizes for the genetic variants under investigation, and thereby increased power to detect genetic loci of interest. Furthermore, given that endophenotypes are measurable traits regardless of disease state, their use can allow the inclusion of unaffected as well as affected subjects in genetic studies, which can also enhance power, especially in family-based studies[18, 19].Genes identified via the endophenotype approach may be more amenable to the study and discovery of genetic pathways underlying disease. This is partly due to the quantifiable nature of the endophenotype, which makes possible objective testing of the downstream effects of genetic perturbations, including development of animal models[20]. A potential caveat of the endophenotype approach is the fact that it represents only one of many aspects of the disease pathology. This may be a limitation for animal models that study the endophenotype rather than disease symptomatology as the outcome. That said, given the improbability of recapitulating the complete spectrum of a complex disease in an animal model and the potential difficulty in drawing parallels between animal and human symptomatology[20], a focused study of a ""good"" endophenotype could enhance our understanding of complex disease pathophysiology.What constitutes a ""good"" endophenotype? A variety of criteria have previously been proposed to define ""valid and useful"" endophenotypes in a review, where a core set of ""necessary and sufficient"" criteria was identified[16]. Although a detailed discussion of these criteria is beyond the scope of this review, we will briefly mention those that are commonly proposed. Endophenotypes should be measured reliably and reproducibly upon multiple measurements of the same subject/sample. Given the proposition that endophenotypes are traits that can be used to map genetic variants underlying disease risk, heritability or having a measurable genetic component is a sine qua non of a useful endophenotype. Neuroimaging[18] and cognitive[17, 21] endophenotypes are examples of heritable traits that are proposed for genetic studies of neuropsychiatric diseases. The underlying assumption is that genes influence the endophenotype in a way that is detectable prior to the clinical onset of disease. These changes in the endophenotype in turn leads to increased disease risk. Consequently, endophenotypes should be associated with the disease in the general population and also co-segregate with it within families. They should manifest changes that are detectable in the clinically-unaffected but at-risk subjects, such as family members of patients. We determined that plasma Aβ levels, which show variation in the general population, show significant elevations in cognitively-normal first-degree relatives of patients with late-onset AD[22] and are highly heritable traits[23]. Thus, we used plasma Aβ as an excellent endophenotype in a linkage study of late-onset AD pedigrees and mapped an AD risk locus on chromosome 10[19]. Endophenotypes need not, however, be disease-specific. For example, both neuroimaging and cognitive endophenotypes are quantitative traits that are variable and detectable in the general population. These endophenotypes may show changes that are associated with more than one psychiatric or neurologic disorder. Ideally, endophenotypes should be state-independent, and not change with the disease state or environmental factors. For example, although potentially useful endophenotypes for AD and possibly also other neurodegenerative diseases, both neuroimaging and cognitive endophenotypes are influenced by the disease state, as well as other variables such as age and gender[24]. It is therefore important to recognize and either statistically or technically control for such variables in genetic analysis of endophenotypes.The evidence supporting a strong genetic component that influences human gene expression is discussed in the next section.","In this section, 15 key studies using expression levels as an endophenotype to identify genetic loci or variants that influence human gene expression are reviewed (Tables 1 and 2). This approach is known as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping via genetic linkage in families or association studies in unrelated populations. This section describes these studies highlighting their results which provide support for the existence of a substantial genetic component for gene expression in humans and how this component could be utilized to study the genetics of complex diseases and traits.Table 1 Summary of studies on geneticsof human gene expression: Study characteristicsFull size tableTable 2 Summary of studies on geneticsof human gene expression: Analyses, results, conclusions.Full size tableGenetic linkage analysis of whole transcriptome expression levels in yeast determined that 1,528 of the 6,215 genes tested had natural variation in their expression levels and 570 of these gene expression phenotypes showed linkage to ≥ 1 loci in the yeast genome[25]. This study demonstrated that genetic factors account for a substantial proportion of variation in gene expression levels, even in a single cell organism. The first study in humans to evaluate genetics of gene expression (also known as the genetical genomics approach[26]) utilized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from the CEPH[27] (Centre d'Etude du polymorphisme humain) repository of Caucasian, multi-generational families[28]. Yan et al. screened 96 subjects and identified 17-37 individuals who were heterozygous for a SNP in 13 target genes. Measuring the mRNA of these 13 genes in the same cellular sample, they assessed relative expression of the two alleles of the SNPs and identified evidence of allele-specific expression for 6 of 13 genes in a subset of their samples. Examining the gene expression levels as a phenotype, they identified evidence of Mendelian inheritance for two expression phenotypes that co-segregated with nearby genetic markers in two families. These results provided the foundation to utilize the ""genetical genomics"" approach in a more high-throughput and systematic fashion.Schadt et al. provided a comparative analysis of gene expression genetics in mouse, Zea mays and human, in a pioneering study which showed the generalizability of this approach to different organisms[29]. In this study, an eQTL linkage analysis was performed using 23,574 transcript expression levels measured in livers of 111 mice from the F2 generation of two standard inbred strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and >100 microsatellite markers. Differential gene expression was detected for >33% of the genes in the parental and ≥10% genes in the F2 strain. 9-16% genes have eQTLs with LOD scores > 4.3. To identify transcripts that influence the complex obesity trait in these mice, the authors compared the gene expression profiles of mice at the lower vs. upper 25th percentile of an obesity trait and identified three distinct expression patterns for 280 genes. Importantly, these 280 genes were enriched for eQTLs and linkage analysis of the obesity trait performed on the subgroups with distinct expression patterns improved the linkage signal. These results established a paradigm for the combined use of gene expression traits and another complex trait of clinical relevance for improved mapping of genetic factors that influence the complex clinical trait by affecting gene expression levels.Analysis of corn (Z. mays) ear leaf tissue using the eQTL approach in the same study[29] identified that 77% of genes had differential expression in this organism, 26% had ≥ 1 eQTL with LOD score > 3.0 and there appeared to be genetic interactions between some of the eQTLs. Schadt et al. also studied a small number of human LCLs of 56 subjects from four CEPH families by variance components analysis and identified differential expression for 11% of the genes assayed of which about a third had detectable heritability. Overall, these findings demonstrate the complexity of gene expression genetics ranging from a ""simpler"" plant organism to humans, but also the applicability of genetical genomics approach in tracking eQTLs in different organisms.One of the first studies which established the natural variation of gene expression levels in humans, evaluated LCLs of 35 unrelated subjects from CEPH families vs. 1 reference pool of 10 subjects[30] utilizing 3-4 replicate measurements per person. They determined that for many genes (n = 813) between-person gene expression variations were higher than within-person variations, which are due to technical variability. Evaluation of 5 genes, which revealed highest variance among unrelateds, then sibs then monozygotic twins, provided proof of principle for a genetic component underlying at least some of the variability in human gene expression.Seven of the studies[31–37] following these initial reports utilized human LCL for eQTL mapping. Three of these studies[31–33] assessed cell lines from the CEPH repository[27], similar to the prior reports[28–30], three utilized LCL from the HapMap consortium[6, 34–36] and one studied samples from families with an asthma proband[37]. Morley et al.[31] measured levels of 8,500 transcripts in 94 unrelated subjects from CEPH families and identified 3,554 (42%) transcripts with greater between-subject (biological) variation than within-subject (technical). Genome-wide linkage analysis of these 3,554 expression phenotypes in 14 CEPH families (n~140) detected evidence of significant linkage for 984 (28%) transcripts with genome-wide p < 0.05 and for 142 (~4%) with genome-wide p < 0.001, which far exceeds the numbers expected by chance alone. When these eQTLs were distinguished as cis- or trans-regulators, defined in this study as linkage regions within or outside 5 Megabases (5 Mb) of the target gene, respectively, most of the top 142 eQTLs were found to be trans-regulators. Some expression traits had multiple significant eQTLs. There were linkage regions with multiple expressions linking to it, termed as expression ""hotspots"" or ""master regulators"". Importantly, genes that map to one hotspot had expression levels with higher than expected correlations and some of them had close physical locations.Monks et al.[32], also assessed LCLs from CEPH families (n = 167), though they measured a larger number of transcripts than Morley et al.[31], with 23,499 expression phenotypes that were evaluated by variance components analysis for their heritability, as well as eQTL analysis. They determined that 10% of the genes were differentially expressed in ≥50% of children, and a third of these were heritable at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and median heritability of 0.34. The heritable transcripts were enriched for immunity pathways. Twenty-two genes had significant eQTLs at genome-wide level, eight of which were within 5 Mb of the gene (i.e. cis-regulating). In contrast to Morley et al.[31], Monks et al.[32] did not find an enrichment for transcription ""hotspots"" over what would be expected by chance alone, based on simulation studies. The authors studied a subset of 574 transcripts with heritability for pairwise genetic correlations (GC) and Pearson's correlations (PC), which does not account for a genetic component, followed by pathway analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.org/) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) databases. This analysis revealed that genes clustered by both GC and PC had similar pathway coherence for GO, but that GC gene clusters had better pathway coherence for KEGG pathways. This suggests that analysis of pairwise genetic correlations between gene expression phenotypes may identify novel biological pathways that may not be possible by approaches which neglect the genetic component of correlations.In a follow up to their prior linkage study[31], Cheung et al.[33] assessed 57 unrelated CEPH subjects in an association study for 374 expression phenotypes with prior evidence of linkage at p < 0.02 and cis-SNPs near linkage peaks (± 50 kb of target gene). Additionally, they evaluated the top 27 cis-linkage expression phenotypes (p < 3.7 × 10-5), in a GWAS using >770,000 SNPs. They determined that 65 of 374 expression levels have ≥1 SNP that associates at nominal p < 0.001, 12 with p < 10-10 and 133 with p < 0.01. Same proportions of associations were found for the 5', 3' and genic regions. Fourteen out of the top 27 cis-linkage regions showed associations significant at the genome-wide level after Bonferroni corrections for the number of SNPs tested. Twelve of those top 14 associations were cis only, one was cis+trans and one was trans only. The authors also performed functional analysis for one of the top genes and confirmed the presence of a functional variant that influenced gene expression by modifying strength of RNA polymerase II binding. This study demonstrated that strong linkage also predicts strong association for expression levels and expression GWAS (eGWAS) may be a feasible and powerful approach to identify genetic determinants of expression phenotypes.In the first of three studies[34–36] performed using HapMap LCL, Stranger et al.[34] analyzed 60 samples for levels of 1,433 transcripts (630 genes), then performed eGWAS for 688 transcripts (374 genes) with highly variable expression signals above the background. They compared and identified good concordance between three methods for multiple corrections: Bonferroni, FDR and permutations. There were 10-40 genes which had cis-SNPs (defined as 1 Mb from genomic midpoint of gene) significant at genome-wide level by ≥1 statistical method, whereas trans signals were detected only for 3 genes.In a subsequent larger study, Stranger et al.[35], investigated LCL from four HapMap populations: 30 Caucasian trios (CEU), 30 Yoruba trios (YRI), 45 unrelated Chinese (CHB) and 45 unrelated Japanese (JPT). Analysis of 14,456 transcripts (13,643 genes) revealed a genetic component with heritabilities > 0.2 in 10% (4,829) and 13% (6,482) of the transcript probes analyzed in the CEU and YRI trios, respectively, with 958 overlapping genes. There were 154 CEU and 217 YRI genes with substantial heritability >0.5, with overlap of 9 genes. There were 831 genes (6% genes tested) with a cis-association significant in at least 1 population at p < 0.001 after 10,000 permutations; 310 in at least 2 and 62 in all four populations. There were many less trans-associations, with 108 significant genes in ≥1 population, 16 genes in ≥2 and 5 in all 4 populations. These findings demonstrate the presence of both overlap and diversity in significant eSNPs across different ethnic groups. More than 50% of the significant eQTLs had heritability estimates > 0.2, though pooling populations to increase sample size captured some additional genes with smaller effect sizes. Most trans-SNPs were also found to have cis-effects and most cis-associations were in genic and immediate intergenic regions, suggesting that cis-variants may be more abundant and/or may have stronger effects than trans-variants. This study also evaluated the influence of technical variability on gene expression measurements by testing 60 cell lines on two different arrays, that led to results with high correlations, suggesting that transcript measurements are stable across different experiments, measurement times and platforms. They also identified that CEU population, which had the most aged cell lines, also had the most divergent expression profile from other populations, drawing attention to the potential technical concerns with LCL.To investigate the contribution of a different type of genetic variation, namely copy number variants (CNVs) to gene expression levels, Stranger et al.[36], performed association of 14,925 transcripts (14,072 genes) with CNVs in the same four HapMap populations[35] and determined that there are significant CNV associations that replicate across ethnic groups as well as those that are unique to one ethnic group. Mapping of CNVs vis à vis the genes suggested that CNVs exert their effects by disrupting both regulatory regions as well as the genic regions and altering gene dosage. Notably, most CNV associations cannot be detected by SNPs (87%), indicating the importance of the survey of structural variants in addition to SNPs in eGWAS.In a study of 400 LCL from affected and unaffected children of families with an asthma proband, Dixon et al.[37], studied 54,675 transcripts (20,599 genes). First, there were no significant differences in the expression profiles between asthmatics and non-asthmatics (unchallenged cells). Twenty-eight percent of the transcripts (15,084) corresponding to 6,660 genes have heritabilities > 0.3, which is in good agreement with prior reports[29, 32]. 1,989 transcripts had significant associations at genome-wide level, where many of the strongest associations were in cis. This study did not identify master regulators with strong effects. Combined investigation of these eGWAS results with those of published GWAS on some diseases, identified potential candidate genes for asthma, Crohn's disease, diabetes and thalassemia implying that eGWAS is a useful approach to detect disease SNPs with a functional role.In one of the largest eQTL studies to date, Goring et al.[38] analyzed 1240 lymphocyte (not LCL) samples collected from multigenerational Mexican-American families from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) for 19,648 transcripts (18,519 genes). Nearly 85% of the transcripts (16,678) were significantly heritable with a median heritability estimate of 22.5%. This estimate is similar to those from some LCL studies[29, 32, 37]. There were 1,345 significant cis-regulated transcripts with median effect size of 24.6%. There were many less trans-regulators, again reinforcing the idea that trans effects likely have smaller effect sizes than those in cis. This study was able to replicate the cis-findings of Morley et al.[31], but not those in trans, which suggests higher stability of cis-regulatory effects across studies, populations and cell types, contrary to trans-effects, which may either be more cell/tissue-specific, may have smaller effect sizes or may be false positives. There was also no evidence of ""master regulators"" in this study. The authors demonstrated the utility of the eQTL approach in complex trait mapping, by identifying eSNPs which associate with HDL-cholesterol levels and expression levels of VNN1. They ultimately identified variants in this gene with functional consequences on transcription binding.The first eQTL study to systematically compare two different tissues and pursue combined genetic analysis of expression levels and complex traits -in this case obesity-related phenotypes[39]- assessed 20,877 transcripts in the blood (IFB cohort; n = 1,002) and adipose tissue (IFA cohort; n = 673) of Icelandic families, genotyped for 1,732 microsatellite markers for linkage analysis and also for 317,503 SNPs for association analysis in a subset of 150 unrelated subjects. In this study, adipose tissue expression levels (63-72%) correlated better with obesity traits than do blood expression levels (3-9%), and this effect was more pronounced when the analysis was confined to the subset of subjects that overlapped in the blood and adipose tissue cohorts. Fifty-five percent of blood and 75% of adipose tissue transcripts were significantly heritable, with average heritability estimates of 30%, similar to the estimates from prior studies[29, 32, 37, 38]. Variance components linkage analysis revealed 2,529 (12%) significant cis-eQTLs in blood, and 1,489 (7%) in adipose tissue, where cis-eQTL region corresponded to the microsatellite located nearest the expression probe of interest. Greater than 50% of the significant adipose tissue cis-eQTLs were also significant in blood. Expression traits with higher heritability in both tissues had greater reproducibility of eQTL signals. Thus, although there is significant overlap in genetic factors underlying gene expression in two different tissue types, expression levels from the clinically-relevant tissue appears to correlate better with clinical-phenotypes. There were many less significant trans-eQTLs and no evidence of ""master regulators"" above what would be expected by chance alone. There were 2,714 (12.9%) significant cis-SNPs in blood and 3,364 (16%) in adipose tissue, where cis-SNPs were defined as those residing within a 2 Mb window centered at the location of the probe corresponding to the transcript of interest.This study, by Emilsson et al.[39], also characterized the transcriptional network by evaluating all pair-wise correlations in the most differentially expressed genes and generated a ""connectivity map"", which defined ""connectivity"" of a given gene as ""the sum of its connection strengths with all other genes in the network"". This approach identified a group of highly correlated gene-expressions (termed ""network module"") in human adipose tissue, which significantly overlapped with a ""network module"" in mouse adipose tissue. This module was found to be significantly enriched for genes in macrophage activation pathways. These genes also had cis-eSNPs which significantly influenced expression levels as well as obesity-related traits. These results collectively demonstrate that expression correlation networks combined with cis-eSNPs could potentially identify genes/pathways underlying complex clinical phenotypes.Using similar approaches with Emilsson et al.[39], but human liver tissue from 427 unrelated subjects, Schadt et al.[40], performed an eGWAS using levels of 39,280 transcripts (34,266 genes) and 782,476 SNPs. At Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05, there were 1,350 expression traits (1,273 genes, 3.7%) and at FDR <10%, 3,210 traits (3,043 genes; 8.8%) which had ≥1 significant cis-eSNP, explaining 2-90% of variation in expression levels. In contrast, significant trans-eQTLs were far fewer with only 242 traits (236 genes) or 491 traits (474 genes) showing significance after Bonferroni or FDR corrections, respectively. Comparison of their former blood and adipose tissue eQTLs[39] to the liver eQTLs determined 30% overlap of cis-eQTLs from each tissue with significant liver cis-eQTLs. By combining their liver eGWAS with publicly available disease GWAS data and transcriptional network approach[39], Schadt et al.[40] identified SORT1 and CELSR2 as candidate genes for coronary artery disease and LDL cholesterol levels, and RPS26 for Type 1 diabetes. These findings have implications for mapping those loci that influence disease risk by affecting gene expression levels. They demonstrate how the combined eQTL and disease mapping approaches can help distinguish the actual disease susceptibility gene in regions of LD, where SNPs in more than one gene may associate with disease risk, but only the disease-related transcript levels will associate with the eSNPs.There are two published eGWAS utilizing transcript levels from human brain tissue[41, 42]. The first study by Myers et al.[41] assessed neuropathologically ""normal"" cerebral cortical tissue from 193 subjects for 14,078 transcripts and 366,140 SNPs. They determined that 58% of the transcriptome had expression in ≥5% of control brains. Of these, 21% had significant associations with a cis- or trans-eSNP. Contrary to prior studies[34, 35, 37–40] performed in human LCL, lymphocyte, adipose and liver tissue, human brain eGWAS identified less significant cis-eSNPs (433 eSNPs for 99 transcripts) than trans-eSNPs (16,701 eSNPs for 2,876 transcripts). There was, nevertheless, enrichment of significant cis- vs. trans-associations over chance expectations at distances close to the transcripts and maximizing at distances <70 kb. Myers et al.[41] determined that MAPT cis-eSNP alleles that are on the major H1 haplotype are associated with higher MAPT transcript levels, in agreement with their prior study[43]. Compared to Cheung et al.[33], and Stranger et al.[44], there were only two common results (1 cis and 1 trans-association), in contrast to 30% overlap of cis-eQTLs between liver[40] and blood or adipose tissue[39] transcriptomes. These differences could arise from differences in platform and/or may suggest a more distinct genetic control for the brain transcriptome. Technical challenges arising from measuring levels of potentially degraded transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue[45], in comparison to other tissues that may have more well-preserved RNA, may also underlie some of these discrepancies.In the follow-up brain eGWAS, Webster et al.[42], assessed 176 brain samples with AD neuropathology, and performed a joint evaluation with 188 control brains from their prior study[41]. The analyses were restricted to 8,650 transcripts out of 24,357 (35.5%), which were detected in >90% of the cases and controls. Similar to control brains, 58% of the transcriptome was detectable in ≥5% of AD brains. Assessment of technical and biological covariates revealed that hybridization date and APOE had the strongest influence and post-mortem interval had the least influence on brain expression levels. There were 1,829 significant cis-eSNPs (within gene ± 1 Mb of 3' or 5' end) in their combined sample and 656 significant trans-eSNPs. Twenty-seven percent of all eQTLs were found to have significant interaction term with diagnosis. Of the cis-eSNPs with significant diagnosis interaction, 37% were also found in just the control brains. Thus, a subset of cis-eSNPs that influence transcript levels differentially for AD subjects, also influence gene expression in control brains, suggesting that a portion of disease-relevant eSNPs may be captured in disease-free tissue and also that presence of other factors besides the disease-relevant eSNPs are likely necessary to predispose to AD. The authors did network analysis on transcripts with a significant eQTL and those that were differentially expressed between ADs and controls, but did not have a significant eQTL. This led to the identification of some transcript clusters that were significantly enriched for gene ontology groups; and ""hub"" genes with expression levels that correlate with many other transcripts. The authors highlighted their findings of significant cis-eSNPs that influence expression of GSTO2, but not GSTO1, which were previously implicated in AD risk[46, 47], thereby implicating GSTO2 as the likely AD risk gene in this region.Collective evidence from the eQTL studies discussed in this section lead to the following conclusions:

1)
Transcriptome expression levels can be repliably and replicably detected in human cell lines and multiple types of tissues.


2)
Genetic factors account for a substantial proportion (3-85% depending on study size, tissue source, expression platform) of the variation in human gene expression, with median heritability estimates of 20-30% in most studies. This is similar to the genetics of gene expression for other organisms.


3)
Expression QTLs can be mapped by linkage or eGWAS approaches.


4)
Most eQTLs appear to be cis-regulating, suggesting that trans-eQTLs may have smaller effect sizes.


5)
Both SNPs and structural variations, namely CNVs, appear to underlie eQTL effects.


6)
Many eQTLs are common across different ethnic groups, though there appear to be eQTLs that are unique to one ethnic group.


7)
Many eQTLs are common across different tissue types, though there appear to be eQTLs that are unique to one tissue type.


8)
""Gene expression endophenotype"" approach is powerful and can detect hundreds to thousands of significant eQTLs with hundreds of subjects, unlike ""complex disease mapping"" approaches. Increasing sample size has the most impact on power for eQTL studies (vs. increasing SNP markers).


9)
""Gene expression endophenotype"" approach can be utilized in conjunction with mapping for complex diseases or other disease-related phenotypes to identify or confirm novel genes with functional eSNPs that confer disease risk. ""Network"" analysis of human eQTLs alone or in conjunction with those from other organisms can identify novel biological pathways that may be ""disease-relevant"".


10)
""Disease-relevant"" eQTLs are more likely to be captured in ""disease-relevant"" tissue (e.g. obesity-related eQTLs in adipose tissue)[39], although many such eQTLs may also be identified in other tissues. There appears to be substantial overlap in eQTLs detected from subjects with and without disease, although detection of some eQTLs may require assessment of ""disease-relevant"" tissue from subjects with disease.

","Gene expression endophenotypes have thus far been utilized in two types of studies in neurodegenerative diseases: ""Candidate gene"" studies, where influence of variants on expression levels of one or a few candidate genes are assessed; and ""Expression profiling"" studies, which compare levels of transcriptome expression in tissues from patients vs. controls in an effort to identify novel disease genes and pathways. This section provides examples of both types of studies to demonstrate the most common use of gene expression endophenotypes in neurodegenerative diseases to date. While not a comprehensive review on these studies, it will provide knowledge on these current approaches, including their uses and limitations.Gene Expression Endophenotypes in Neurodegenerative Diseases-""Candidate gene"" approachThe initial studies utilizing the gene expression endophenotype in neurodegenerative diseases, have been conducted for known disease risk genes. A prime example of this is Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), which is a well-established risk factor for AD, where the coding ApoEε4 polymorphism is associated with increased risk[48], but is neither sufficient nor necessary for its development (reviewed in[49]). Polymorphisms in the promoter region of APOE, which influence its expression, have received some attention as potential modifiers of AD risk that may be independent of ApoEε4 (reviewed in [50]). Although gene expression levels have not been directly used as endophenotypes in most of these studies, these polymorphisms were investigated because of their predicted influence on ApoE expression based on their location and in-vitro functional assays. One of the most well-studied of these polymorphisms is -491A/T, which was initially found to confer risk for AD in its -491AA homozygote form, even in subjects who lacked the risky ApoEε4 allele[51]. Functional transcriptional studies identified a stronger promoter activity for APOE -491A vs. -491T containing constructs[51]. ApoEε4 with the -491AA genotype had greater AD risk compared to those with one or no copies of the -491A allele, suggesting that both the isoform and level of expression of ApoE may be important in conferring disease risk and that ApoEε4 subjects with higher expression of this protein may be at highest risk[52]. While this notion is in agreement with findings from animal studies[53], the influence of ApoE promoter polymorphisms on brain ApoE levels have not been conclusive[50].Another gene implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, which was investigated with the expression endophenotype approach, is microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT). Missense and exon 10 splicing mutations in MAPT lead to frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), whereas a region of LD within MAPT, known as the H1 haplotype is associated with increased risk of taupathies, namely, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) compared with the (reviewed in [54]). Given the increase in MAPT exon 10-containing transcripts (also known as 4 repeat or 4R tau) in affected brain regions in PSP and CBD, Caffrey et al.[55, 56] performed allele-specific gene expression studies in both human neuronal cell lines and brain tissue of MAPT H1/H2 heterozygous subjects. They determined that the risky MAPT H1 haplotype is associated with significantly higher MAPT exon 10-containing transcript expression without significant total MAPT levels compared to MAPT H2 haplotype. Myers et al. identified MAPT H1c as the sub-haplotype associated with an increase in both total and 4R tau levels in the human brain, with higher in-vitro transcriptional activity and with increased AD risk[43].While the above examples demonstrate how the gene expression endophenotypes can be exploited to uncover the underlying biology of well-established genes in neurodegenerative diseases, our work utilizing the cerebellar expression levels of 12 late-onset AD (LOAD) candidate genes in 200 AD brains illustrate the use of this approach in identification of novel functional disease risk polymorphisms[12]. In this study, Zou et al. investigated association of 619 cis-SNPs with cerebellar expression levels of 12 LOAD candidate genes and identified three significant cis-SNPs in insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The top cis-SNP (rs7910977) reached genome-wide significance where the minor allele led to ~twofold increase in cerebellar IDE mRNA levels, reduced AD risk, and reduced plasma Aβ levels[57], which is biologically congruent. This IDE cis-SNP was in complete LD with an IDE SNP in a conserved region (rs6583817) and increased reporter gene expression in an in-vitro assay, providing additional evidence for a functional effect of this polymorphism on gene expression.Gene Expression Endophenotypes in Neurodegenerative Diseases-""Expression Profiling"" approachLarge-scale comparisons of gene expression levels in subjects with disease vs. controls, known as ""Expression Profiling"" is one of the most commonly used approaches implementing the gene expression endophenotype. While potentially illuminating, this approach is vulnerable to technical confounders that may influence gene expression differentially in subjects with disease vs. controls, including tissue and RNA integrity[45]. To minimize these confounds, disease vs. control tissues need to be carefully matched and/or these variables need to be accounted for in the statistical analyses. Additional technical confounders to consider and control are microarray platform and quality and batch effects for experiments conducted on different dates[58]. There are important statistical considerations including variability in expression levels, which may lead to false positive findings especially for low expressing genes with high variability, as well as false negative results for those with small, but reproducible changes[58]. Perhaps the most important biological caveat is that, expression profiling design, especially if conducted in the disease-relevant tissue, does not distinguish expression changes that are a result of the disease process from those that are underlying causes of it. In this aspect, it is inferior to the eQTL approach, which can be designed to uncover the genetic factors underlying expression changes and disease risk. Despite these pitfalls, the potential utility of the expression profiling approach will be discussed in this section, highlighting the results from several expression profiling studies in neurodegenerative diseases.In a hippocampal gene expression profiling study of 9 control and 22 AD subjects of various severity, determined by the bedside cognitive test, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)[59], Blalock et al.[60] correlated expression levels with both cognitive (MMSE) and neuropathology (neurofibrillary tangle) scores, in all subjects as well as the subset of nine controls or mild ADs with MMSE scores of 20-26 (collectively termed as the ""Incipient ADs""). They identified upregulation of genes that pertain to transcription factor and tumor suppressor pathways among others. The small sample size and the inability to discriminate expression changes ""due to"" vs. ""underlying"" disease are the main concerns with this otherwise novel approach, which utilized three endophenotypes.Bossers et al.[61] utilized a similar approach by generating expression profiles of 49 prefrontal cortex samples from subjects with different severity of underlying AD neuropathology detected by Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles[62]. There were 1,071 transcripts (922) genes which showed significant changes in their expression levels with Braak stage. Some of these findings were validated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). There were clusters of genes which appeared to show concerted changes with advancing Braak stage, such as increasing early and then decreasing (UPDOWN clusters) or vice versa (DOWNUP clusters), where the biggest changes coincide with the appearance of amyloid plaques at Braak stage III. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of these clusters, revealed an enrichment for synaptic genes in the UPDOWN cluster and those involved in proliferation, differentiation and inflammation in the DOWNUP clusters. Importantly, the synaptic gene expression changes correlated with Aβ levels, which led to the conclusion that synaptic activity and Aβ production may be part of a feed-back loop that ultimately leads to AD. Given the appearance of changes even before significant neuropathology or clinical decline, the authors suggest that these findings are not a result of neuronal loss due to disease process.While the previous examples are aimed at understanding the role of gene expression changes in the pathophysiology of a single neurodegenerative disease[60, 61], Bronner et al.[63] performed expression profiling in the medial temporal cortex of 5 patients each from four distinct disease categories, namely, PSP, FTD, AD and PiD (Pick's disease) as well as a control group. Comparison of gene expression profiles between each disease group against controls identified a set of 166 transcript probes, which could discriminate PSP, FTD/PiD from controls and each other. The FTD and PiD groups have similar gene expression profiles. AD had the most similar profile to control group, in this small study. Although given its very limited sample size, this study should be considered as a pilot, it also demonstrates another potential application of gene expression profiling as a means to discriminate between neurodegenerative disorders at a molecular level.Combining genetic association studies with gene expression profiling represents another paradigm utilizing this approach[64, 65]. Taguchi et al. identified 35 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in the hippocampus of AD vs. control subjects, which they tested for genetic association with AD risk[64] in 376 AD patients vs. 376 controls. This study identified nine nominally significant AD risk associations, a higher significance rate than most such studies, with the POU2F1 association also reaching study-wide significance. Similarly, Chapuis et al.[65] performed case-control genetic association analysis for 82 genes that were found to be differentially expressed between 12 control and 9 AD brains, and determined nominally significant associations with AD risk for 17 genes. Of these, the association for IL-33 achieved study-wide significance, which was replicated in three additional series and was found to interact with ApoEε4. The rare allelic variants in IL-33 were associated with decreased risk of AD risk and reduced levels of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Furthermore, overexpression of IL-33 was associated with decreased Aβ40 secretion in-vitro. Though replication studies are necessary, these studies illustrates the utility of gene expression profiling studies in identifying candidate disease genes, some of which may subsequently be shown to associate with both disease risk[64, 65] and other disease-related phenotypes[65]."
1,"Commentary on ""Genetic linkage and transmission disequilibrium of marker haplotypes at chromosome 1q41 in human systemic lupus erythematosus"", by RR Graham et al.","Because linkage analysis approaches had been successful in the identification of disorders inherited as Mendelian traits, it was expected that the genetic basis of common diseases would be identified using a similar approach, but results to date may seem disappointing. As for most common diseases, susceptibility to autoimmunity is thought to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors. These autoimmune diseases tend not to be inherited in simple Mendelian fashion, but exhibit complex patterns of segregation. Investigation of these diseases can often be hampered by factors such as late age at disease onset, variable penetrance, variable phenotypic expression (different combinations of genes may predispose to different patterns of disease), unknown gene–gene and gene–environment interactions, genetic heterogeneity (different genes may produce the same phenotype), and misclassification of clinical phenotypes. Hence, the task of identifying susceptibility genes for complex disorders is enormous.","Twin and family studies suggest that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has a substantial genetic susceptibility component [1,2,3]. Whole-genome scans of SLE families with affected sibling pairs have now been published, and, despite the relatively small sizes of the individual studies and the ethnic heterogeneity of the populations studied, there appears to be a surprising degree of overlap between findings [4,5,6,7,8]. All the studies have reported linkage to regions of the long arm of chromosome 1. In volume 3 issue 5 of this journal, Graham et al. described their approach to following up this linkage data for one of these regions, mapping to 1q41–42 [9].Linkage analysis identifies genomic regions that are shared, identical-by-descent, by siblings affected by disease more often than would be expected by chance alone. However, linkage typically extends for 10 cM or more and such a region could contain 500 genes. Variation in any one of these genes could be responsible for the observed linkage. Association is the nonrandom cosegregation of alleles and assumes that populations are descended from a small founder group and that repeated recombinations over generations reduce the shared chromosomal segments to very small regions. Therefore, in order to detect an association, the marker and disease gene must be in linkage disequilibrium [10]. Because linkage disequilibrium extends for shorter distances (~60 Kbp from common coding variants in the North American population) [11], demonstration of association refines the region likely to harbour the disease gene. Linkage disequilibrium mapping can be carried out either by directly testing potential candidate genes or by using microsatellite markers mapping to a region of linkage. Going directly to candidate genes is fraught with danger. Virtually any gene could be a candidate, and sometimes functional genes appear to have an obscure role, e.g. APOE gene polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease [12].The alternative approach taken by Graham et al. was to try to refine the ~16 cM region of linkage likely to harbour the disease gene by first investigating association with a number of microsatellite markers mapping to the region in 210 families with affected sibling pairs and 122 families with three affected members. Using extensions of the family-based association method, the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) [13], they found strong evidence for association with one marker, D1S490, by all the TDT methods used. Haplotype analysis not only can increase the power to detect association but also can be used to localise the genetic region harbouring the disease gene. Association with three haplotypes spanning ~9 cM was demonstrated using two-marker approaches. When three-marker haplotypes were investigated, however, association with two different combinations of markers, spanning just 3 cM, was demonstrated. The equivalent physical distance is ~2.3 Mb. Reassuringly, linkage to the 1q41–42 region was largely accounted for by families carrying either of two risk haplotypes spanning the five markers. Even though the results presented in the study provide consistent and compelling evidence to support association to the region using a number of tests, it must be remembered that no correction has been applied for multiple testing, and confirmation of these findings in other data sets is required.","The study teaches us several important lessons. Firstly, it demonstrates the usefulness of animal models of disease in implicating candidate susceptibility regions in humans. The 1q41–42 region is homologous to a locus linked to a mouse model of lupus, and linkage in humans was first demonstrated after this area was targeted as a candidate susceptibility region using information from the mouse model [14]. Secondly, it is salutary to note that the linkage results for this region from analysis of whole-genome scans might have been discounted if stringent criteria had been applied [15]. In both whole-genome scans reporting linkage to the region, the LOD scores (logarithms of odds ratios) barely achieved statistically significant evidence for linkage [4,5,6,7]. However, replication of findings by independent groups is strong evidence that the findings are not due to a type-1 error. Identification of association with specific haplotypes of markers and demonstration that families with these haplotypes are largely responsible for the evidence of linkage support the hypothesis that true susceptibility genes may map to the region. Thirdly, this study demonstrates the superior ability of haplotype analysis to detect association over single-point methods. The gain in power from haplotyping arises in two main ways: analysis of single markers for tests of association using TDT-based methods can only use information from families in which transmissions are informative, i.e. when either the known or the inferred parental genotype is heterozygous at the locus under investigation. Haplotype methods can be more powerful, because transmission of a combination of markers is assessed, so that even if the inferred parental genotype is homozygous at one locus, it may not be at a second, third, or subsequent locus. The increase in power provided by haplotype methods also arises because there may be preferential allele transmission at two loci which, when analysed separately, do not achieve statistical significance, whereas a haplotype of alleles from the combination of markers may be strongly associated with disease.","Thus, from a linkage result that implicated an ~16 cM region, Graham et al. have refined the region likely to harbour an SLE disease gene to a manageable 2.3 Mb. A region this size is still likely to contain many candidate genes, so the task of identifying which is the disease gene is still huge. Demonstration of association with polymorphisms mapping to potentially functional domains of a gene may implicate it as the disease gene, but association does not necessarily imply causation (the association could arise due to linkage disequilibrium with a disease mutation in a nearby gene) and confirmation will require functional studies. Alternatively, the animal model in which the homologous region was first implicated may help in the identification of the disease gene."
2,PW01-032 – FMF-like state: genetic factors unrelated to MEFV,"FMF is considered an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory syndrome caused by single gene (MEFV) mutations. Recently, it has been known that also heterozygous mutation carriers can suffer from a mild or incomplete form of FMF, named FMF-like disease. Among Armenians, who have relatively high carrier rate of MEFV mutations, single mutation has been detected in about 1/5 of symptomatic cases. Thus, one cannot exclude the influence of other modifier genes and/or environmental factors which can contribute to the variable penetrance and to the phenotypic variability of FMF-like disease.",The aim of our ongoing project is to better describe the genetic basis of the FMF-like condition unrelated to MEFV by identifying genetic variations in patients with single MEFV mutation.,"From records of more than 8,000 FMF patients we analyzed 105 affected heterozygous sporadic patients with definite diagnosis of FMF and extended Armenian family with variable clinical presentations. All cases were screened for full MEFV gene sequence variations and MEFV-linked five microsatellites. Whole-genome genotyping assay was applied for selected sporadic cases and 30 familial symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Data are analyzed with Illumina GenomeStudio for LOH regions and with MERLIN for linkage analysis.","Genotype-phenotype analysis performed among one and two mutation carriers has showed high probabilities for the presence of major FMF symptoms in heterozygous individuals. Further analysis of selected 12 sporadic cases has revealed a LOH at a region encompassing genes involved in the NF-κB activation in two unrelated FMF-like sporadic patients.Later, we authenticated autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance by finding a single mutated allele or homozygous/compound heterozygous genotypes confirmed by microsatellite analysis in several affected members of the selected family. Four of five sibs of healthy and not-related parents were carriers of a single M694V mutation, where two sibs were diagnosed with FMF and other two were asymptomatic, indicating 50% disease penetrance. Notably, the autosomal dominant inheritance was observed also in the offspring of two affected sibs with 25% (1/4) and 100% (3/3) penetrance. However, in both generations with autosomal dominant FMF we did not find a common MEFV haplotype."
3,Deletion in MEFV resulting in the loss of p.M694 residue as the cause of autosomal dominant familial Mediterranean fever in North Western European Caucasians - a case series and genetic exploration,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the commonest hereditary autoinflammatory disease and it has mostly been reported in populations of Mediterranean ancestry, especially Armenians, Arabs, Turks, non-Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. FMF has a very low prevalence amongst Western Europeans. Its hallmarks are autosomal recessive inheritance and short bursts of illness lasting up to 3 days comprising fever, serositis and arthritis, and which can largely be prevented by daily colchicine treatment. The FMF gene MEFV is located on chromosome 16p andconsists of 10 exons. Although the disease is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, deletion of methionine at position 694 has been associated with dominant inheritance.","This study characterised the phenotype and response to treatment in patients with p.M694del.All of the patients were of Northern European heritage, prompting us to performed haplotype reconstruction to investigate the possibility of common ancestry.",MEFV gene was analysed in 3500 subjects with suspected FMF referred to a single UK centre between 2002 and 2014. Patients with p.M694del underwent additional screening of the SAA1 gene as well as haplotype reconstruction of the MEFV locus.,"The p.M694del variant was identified in 21 patients, sharing an identical disease haplotype that appears to have arisen about 550 years ago. The clinical features comprised typical FMF symptoms with median age at onset of 18 years; three patients presented with AA amyloidosis, of whom two had had symptoms of FMF in retrospect. Fifteen patients had received colchicine treatment, all with excellent responses. The SAA1.1 allele was found in four patients, including two with AA amyloidosis."
4,P01-032 – Characterization of genetic-negative FMF,"Up to 20 percent of FMF cohorts consist of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of familial Mediterranean fever, yet carry no MEFV mutations (genetic-negative). The phenotype of these patients has been poorly characterized.",To define clinical and demographic parameters of genetic negative FMF.,"In this observational comparative study, 47 sequential genetic negative FMF patients and 78 sequential genetic positive (for at least one allele) FMF control patients were compared using a comprehensive questionnaire completed at the time of their routine clinic visit, using direct questioning and patients' files. The definition of FMF was based on our clinical tool, widely accepted for FMF diagnosis. Absence of the 5 most common MEFV mutations in routine genetic testing of FMF was considered genetic negative FMF. Disease severity was determined by Mor criteria.","The mutation-negative and mutation positive cohorts differed respectively on the age of disease onset (19.6 vs. 10.1 years, p<0.001), family history of FMF (44% vs. 76.9%, p<0.001), rate of severe disease (23.4% vs. 64.1%, p<0.001), and rate of erysipelas-like erythema which was higher in the control group (p=0.024). There was a trend for diagnosis delay (9.95 years vs. 6.68 (p=0.08). There were no significant differences in gender and in a wide array of clinical manifestations. The average dose of colchicine, the response to treatment and the rate of chronic manifestation of FMF were also comparable between the two patient groups."
5,The clinical and genetic features of patients with hyper-immunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS),"Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder causing 1 of 2 phenotypes, hyper-immunoglobulin D syndrome and mevalonic aciduria, presenting with recurrent fever episodes, often starting in infancy, and sometimes evoked by stress or vaccinations. This autoinflammatory disease is caused by mutations encoding the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene and is classified in the group of periodic fever syndromes. HIDS is characterized by recurrent fever attacks of 3-7 days that begin in infancy and recur every 4-6 weeks. The febrile period is accompanied by lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, aphthous ulcers, and varying degree of skin involvement. The course and severity of the disease may be quite different. There is no effective or proven therapy for HIDS.",We aim to determine the clinical and genetic characteristics together with the underlying MVK genotypes in single center during a period of 2 years.,"A retrospective review of medical records for patients referred for HIDS over 2 years. We obtain 40 patients (22 female, 18 male) and 25 healthy controls.","The median age of first attack was 33 months (range 2-62 months). The median age of diagnosis was 60 months. The most common symptoms of high fever accompanied respectively: lymphadenopathy (n=27), abdominal pain (n=26), arthralgia (n=20), diarrhea (n=15), aphthous stomatitis (n=13), vomiting (n=12) and maculopapuler rash (n=6) were determined. Amyloidosis was found in a patient (0.3%). The mean serum IgD level was 129±92 mg/dl, it was be normal in 43% of patients.We found mutations in 75% of patients (n=30) in exon 3 and 11 (c155G>A; c1129G>A) in MVK gene. We applied colchicine therapy in 40% of patients while intermittent steroid therapy 20% of patients. Empiric colchicine (40%) and glucocorticosteroids (20%) controlled flares in majority of patients with HIDS. Three patients had also tonsillectomy. We used biologic therapy in 3 patients ( canacinumab (n=2), anakinra (n=1))."
6,The aggrecanopathies; an evolving phenotypic spectrum of human genetic skeletal diseases,"Long bones grow by a process of endochondral ossification and disruptions to this intricate and highly coordinated process result in a diverse group of genetic skeletal diseases (GSDs). GSDs are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases are difficult to diagnosis and there are currently no treatments. This burden in pain and disability leads to poor quality of life and high healthcare costs. Current research efforts are focused on defining disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. One emerging group of GSDs are those resulting from defects in aggrecan, which is the primary proteoglycan component of the cartilage growth plate.","Aggrecan-related bone disorders (ORPHA364817) including:

spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type (ORPHA171866)


macrocephally with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and distinctive facies (OMIN607131)


spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type (ORPHA93283)


familial osteochondritis dissecans (ORPHA251262)


various idiopathic short stature phenotypes


","Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. The World Health Organization estimates that 25 % of adults aged over 65 years suffer pain and/or disability from OA and it is ranked 12th for disease burden in the EU25 with 35–40 million people in Europe suffering from OA. OA is estimated to be 30–70 % genetic with strong environmental risk factors of ageing, obesity and joint trauma [1–3]. At the other end of the spectrum skeletal dysplasias are an extremely diverse and complex group of rare diseases that affect the development and homeostasis of the skeleton [4, 5]. There are more than 450 unique and well-characterised phenotypes and although individually rare, as a group of related orphan diseases, they have an overall prevalence of at least 1 per 4000 children. However, these genetically tractable skeletal dysplasias are a powerful tool for providing new insight into fundamental disease mechanisms of generalised cartilage degradation [6]. In this context, those skeletal dysplasias that result from defects in cartilage structural proteins, such as the collagens, proteoglycans and glycoproteins are of particular relevance for identifying mechanisms of accelerated cartilage degradation that will provide new insight into more common forms of OA [5, 6].","Aggrecan is a large chondroitin sulphated proteoglycan and the founding member of the lectican protein family, which also includes versican, brevican and neurocan [7]. It consists of a 250 kDa protein core with approximately 100 chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycan and 30 keratan sulphate chains attached to a large domain located between three globular domains. Aggrecan comprises an N-terminal domain, two globular domains (G1 and G2), two inter-globular domains, a selectin-like domain (G3) and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 1) [7, 8]. The two inter-globular domains act as chondroitin (CS) and keratin (KS) sulphate attachment regions [8]. The large G3 domain contains two type II (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats, a C-type lectin domain and a complement regulatory protein domain. Aggrecan is expressed in several tissues including those in the brain, but is a major structural component of cartilage. The fixed negative charge of this large proteoglycan is fundamental to cartilage because it attracts ions and water molecules, allowing the cartilage to withstand the high mechanical load found in the skeletal joint [7].Fig. 1Schematic of the aggrecan showing the location of mutations and functions of the individual domains.

7,Genetic counseling for FTD/ALS caused by the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a common cause of presenile dementia, affecting 15 to 20 per 100,000 individuals between ages 45 and 64 years [1]. FTD is a clinical syndrome with three primary subtypes [2, 3]. One subtype, behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), is characterized by marked changes in behavior and personality. Disinhibition and apathy are prominent, and patients with bvFTD frequently display loss of insight, diminished empathy, repetitive motor behaviors, and eating dysregulation. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) comprises the other two subtypes, known as nonfluent variant PPA and semantic variant PPA. Nonfluent variant PPA features loss of grammar with effortful or labored speech, while semantic variant PPA manifests as loss of knowledge of words and objects. Clinical and pathologic features of FTD may also overlap with the atypical Parkinsonian conditions corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy. About 15% of patients with FTD have co-occurring amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [4].ALS is an upper and lower form of motor neuron disease, affecting 4 to 8 per 100,000 individuals [5, 6]. ALS leads to progressive weakness, muscle wasting, spasticity, and eventual paralysis and death due to degeneration of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Clinical diagnosis of ALS is rendered by criteria that exclude other causes of progressive upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction [7]. ALS phenotypes include primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, and progressive bulbar palsy, each involving different spinal or bulbar segments at onset but with variable progression to widespread disease [8]. About 15% of patients with ALS have FTD, while up to 50% exhibit frontal lobe impairment but fail to meet strict criteria for FTD [4, 9, 10].Approximately 40% of individuals with FTD have a family history of dementia [11], and in 10% the history is suggestive of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern [5, 6]. Up to 10% of individuals with ALS have a family history of ALS, usually suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern. An expanded review of family histories considering both syndromes previously suggested that approximately 60% of individuals with co-occurring FTD/ALS have a family history of FTD and/or ALS, with almost 40% of these histories suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern [12].In addition to the co-occurrence of disease in an individual or family, ALS and a significant proportion of patients dying with FTD share a common pathology, TDP-43 [13, 14], which aggregates within cortical, brainstem, and spinal cord neurons. The recent discovery of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene as a common cause of FTD/ALS, familial FTD, and familial ALS [15, 16] should lead to a better understanding of the connection between these two diseases.","Familial FTD has been associated with mutations in genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau [17] and progranulin [18, 19] - and infrequently valosin-containing protein [20] and charged multivescular body protein 2B [21, 22]. Familial ALS has been associated with mutations in genes encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 [23, 24], transacting response DNA binding protein [25, 26], and fused in sarcoma [27, 28] - and infrequently angiogenin [29], optineurin [30], and ubiquilin 2 [31]. Clinical testing is available for all listed genes with the exception of charged multivescular body protein 2B and ubiquilin 2. Most families with the clinical combination of FTD and ALS display linkage to chromosome 9.The underlying genetic cause of chromosome 9-linked FTD and ALS was recently identified [15, 16], and the mutation is an expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in a noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene. Function of the normal gene product is not currently known, but pathogenesis has been proposed to involve a combination of mechanisms: partial loss of function with reduced mRNA transcript and toxic gain of function with aggregation of long mRNA transcript into abnormal RNA foci [15]. Index families with a C9ORF72 expansion present with bvFTD, ALS, or both. Parkinsonism is common, and various ALS phenotypes may be observed [15, 16, 32]. Expansions associated with disease are estimated to have a size range of 700 to 1,600 repeats, as compared with less than 23 repeats in healthy individuals [15]. One study suggested a disease allele size of more than 30 repeats, as compared with a normal allele size of fewer than 20 repeats [16]. C9ORF72 expansions appear to be the most common cause of familial FTD, familial ALS, and sporadic forms of each [15, 16].Since the initial discovery of the C9ORF72 mutation, other FTD and ALS cohorts have been described - suggesting that the frequency of expansion in worldwide sampling is 3 to 12% among individuals with FTD and is 7 to 36% among individuals with ALS, depending on the population studied [15, 33–40]. About two-thirds of expansion carriers have a positive family history of dementia of any etiology or motor neuron disease, with up to 85% exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern [34, 38]. About 4 to 7% of sporadic FTD or ALS cases are associated with an expansion [15, 41]. FTD cases with family histories featuring only one first-degree relative with dementia onset at or after age 65 years are rarely (4.5%) associated with an expansion [38]. When the first-degree relative has dementia onset before age 65 years, the chance of detecting an expansion almost doubles (8%). Less than one-half of FTD cases having two other relatives with unspecified dementia, suggesting familial aggregation but not an autosomal dominant pattern, are associated with an expansion.The frequency of the C9ORF72 expansion is highest in individuals with co-occurring FTD/ALS, as compared with pure bvFTD and ALS phenotypes. About 20 to 40% of persons with FTD/ALS carry the expansion [34, 37, 38, 40], a proportion that significantly increases to up to 50% when there is a positive family history. Clearly, a family history of FTD and/or ALS raises the possibility of the presence of a C9ORF72 expansion, with FTD/ALS being most suggestive. Yet not all such familial cases carry the expansion.The phenotype of individuals carrying a C9ORF72 expansion is similar to that of noncarriers. The most common presentation is bvFTD, which is frequently accompanied by motor neuron involvement. Up to 40% of expansion carriers with bvFTD had upper or lower motor neuron signs [34]. A small subset of patients with nonfluent variant PPA carries the expansion [37–39]. Semantic variant PPA, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy have not been associated with C9ORF72 expansions. Individuals with ALS may have motor neuron involvement of any segment at onset, and may even present with rare ALS phenotypes, including monomelic ALS and progressive muscular atrophy [15].Men and women are equally likely to carry the C9ORF72 expansion. Mean age of onset is about 55 years, with a range of 30 to 70 years [33–40]. The disease duration ranges from 1 to 22 years, with an average of 7 years from symptom onset and with the ALS phenotype associated with shorter survival [34]. Individuals with a slowly progressive bvFTD phenotype, sometimes referred to as phenocopies, may harbor the expansion [42]. An interesting feature of the C9ORF72 expansion is its association with delusions. Often having a paranoid or somatoform quality, delusions occur in 20 to 40% of expansion carriers [33, 34, 40]. Hallucinations are also reported [34, 39]. Symptoms may thus be attributed to primary psychiatric disease instead of to a neuro-degenerative condition.Among individuals with a C9ORF72 expansion, magnetic resonance imaging shows bilateral, symmetrical frontal atrophy, with grey matter loss in orbitofrontal, medial, and dorsolateral regions, as well as anterior temporal atrophy. In contrast to other bvFTD-associated gene mutations, cerebellar atrophy appears to be uniquely associated with the expansion, despite the absence in carriers of frank cerebellar signs. Thalamic atrophy may also be uniquely associated with the expansion [33, 43]. The C9ORF72 expansion displays TDP-43 neuropathology - in most cases consistent with harmonized FTLD-TDP type B, but in some cases type-A pathology is evident [34, 38, 40].","The recent C9ORF72 gene discovery has created momentum towards greater understanding of FTD and ALS, allowing refinement of the phenotypes conferred by the expansion and fostering insight into the mechanism that results in overlapping symptomatology and shared TDP-43 pathology. At the same time, families living with the illnesses now have many considerations, particularly in the face of many unknowns.While the a priori chance of a C9ORF72 expansion among individuals with an autosomal dominant family history is significant, the risk for individuals with no family history of dementia or motor neuron disease is only 4 to 7% [15, 41, 44]. For individuals whose family history includes relatives with dementia or other psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorder that has not been well phenotyped, the likelihood of an expansion is difficult to quantify. In addition, for individuals with a family history of relatives with mid-life onset of psychiatric symptoms that have been inadequately phenotyped, questions arise about whether or not FTD could have been overlooked in a relative, thereby complicating genetic risk assessment.Risk assessment is also complicated by the occurrence of the C9ORF72 expansion in sporadic cases of FTD and ALS. Refinement of clinical, neuroimaging [37], and neuropathological [45, 46] parameters will probably improve the ability to predict the presence of a mutation in sporadic cases, but careful attention to patients in whom the family history appears negative is critical. True sporadic cases should be distinguished from apparently sporadic ones, in which various reasons may explain the lack of a family history: unknown or incomplete information, misdiagnoses, early death, false paternity, or undisclosed adoption. Early death of a relative may be a confounder because of reports of reduced penetrance associated with the expansion, as in the report of a C9ORF72-positive family with one obligate carrier who died at age 35 years without symptoms and another obligate carrier who died at age 72 years without symptoms [34]. A large cross-sectional study suggested that 50% of individuals with an expansion are symptomatic by age 58 years, while nearly 100% are affected by age 80 years. Disease onset before age 35 years appears to occur rarely [41].True sporadic cases may reflect the occurrence of de novo expansions, as supported by the observation that a particular 9p21 risk haplotype is over-represented in individuals with an expansion [41]. One explanation for this finding is the possibility that the haplotype may provide a predisposing genetic background for the mutation to occur randomly in sporadic cases [15]. In contrast, some data suggest that the expansion is about 1,500 years old and arises from a common founder of Finnish origin [47]. Irrespective of origins, the possibility to detect an expansion in an individual without a family history, although small, may raise concerns among families facing disease.At the time of writing this article, C9ORF72 genetic testing has only recently become clinically available in the US, following the development of a test with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification. The C9ORF72 gene test also has limited availability worldwide [48]. Although a CLIA test exists, one of the barriers to its widespread clinical utility is the unknown minimum number of repeats that confer a phenotype [15, 16]. The repeat unit is large at six nucleotides, and in affected individuals the unit expands to more than several hundred in number, whereas in healthy individuals it remains at fewer than 20 to 23. The role of intermediate repeat sizes (23 to 700 repeats) is not known [15, 44, 46]. Because the repeat unit is large in size, GC rich, and unstable, the number of repeats cannot be quantified precisely by PCR. Southern blotting, the current method used to quantify repeat number, is labor intensive and may have difficulty discriminating repeat sizes at the smaller end of the intermediate spectrum. To date, the largest US laboratory that offers a CLIA test employs only semiquantification by PCR, and will not offer the test to asymptomatic individuals. International laboratories that perform the C9ORF72 test may also adopt similar practices. Until quantification by Southern blotting is first investigated in a large patient series [44] and later incorporated into the CLIA test, families should approach clinical genetic testing with careful consideration.In addition, until the minimum number of pathogenic repeats is known, the suggestion that anticipation may be associated with the C9ORF72 expansion cannot be confirmed. Studies have observed that the most recent generation of affected individuals in some families had symptoms at least a decade earlier than those in the previous generation [34, 36]. Better correlation of clinical patterns to exact repeat size is needed before claims of decreasing age of onset and increasing severity of symptoms are associated with larger numbers of repeats across successive generations. is scenario may create uncertainty for expansion-positive families with at-risk individuals considering genetic testing.While a sizeable proportion of familial FTD and familial ALS is caused by the C9ORF72 expansion, there remain familial cases in which no expansion is found [34]. In these cases, the absence of a mutation in other known FTD and ALS genes suggests that there are still other unidentified causal genes implicated in FTD and/or ALS. Families left with no identifiable causal gene, despite a suggestive family history, may struggle with persistent uncertainty.","The growing but limited body of knowledge about the C9ORF72 expansion has important implications for genetic counseling of families. Genetic counseling is a communication process about the occurrence or risk of an inherited disease. Genetic counseling aims to educate individuals about disease, including the nature of inheritance; to facilitate understanding of genetic testing options for confirmation of disease or prediction of future disease onset; and to promote adaptation to the presence of or risk for disease [49]. The last aim is particularly important because of the devastating impact of FTD and/or ALS on families and the absence of prevention or treatment. Individuals who wish to learn the potential cause of FTD and/or ALS in their family should be offered genetic counseling, irrespective of but especially in the presence of a suggestive family history (Table 1).Table 1 Key features of C9ORF72 genetic counselingFull size tableAssessing family history is a key component of genetic counseling. The clinician should obtain a detailed three-generation pedigree that captures the presence of FTD, ALS, other dementias, Parkinsonism, and psychiatric conditions. The pedigree should include ages of disease onset, diagnoses, and ages at death. Medical records, including autopsy studies if available, are essential to clarify diagnoses. In the absence of a family history, the likelihood of detecting an expansion is small but not insignificant [41]. Genetic counseling should include a discussion of 50% risk to offspring of an expansion carrier, regardless of whether or not this expansion is de novo. Pre-test genetic counseling should help individuals appreciate the risks, benefits, and limitations of testing. At this time, predictive or presymptomatic testing should be undertaken with caution. Little is known about anticipation, penetrance, or the meaning of intermediate length expansion repeats.Pre-test genetic counseling should help individuals anticipate the impact of genetic testing on themselves, family members, and their interpersonal relationships. For the individual who is cognitively or behaviorally impaired, genetic counseling should involve a healthcare proxy, legal guardian, or next of kin. If the proxy is an at-risk offspring or sibling, genetic counseling should address any conflicting motivations among family members for testing, while fostering a decision that best serves the family rather than the individual only. Families should consider the limitations of genetic testing, including the fact that detection of an expansion will resolve neither issues of reduced penetrance nor clinical heterogeneity. The expansion cannot predict exact age of onset or symptom expressivity. Why some individuals develop FTD or ALS or both is unclear, but there are probably other, as yet unidentified, genetic and possible environmental modifiers involved. In the context of diagnostic testing, detecting an expansion cannot predict the exact disease course. Moreover, the absence of an expansion may not reduce risk for other family members, particularly if there is an autosomal dominant family history. There remain as yet unidentified causal genes, compelling families to confront risk of disease without knowing the exact cause. Genetic counseling should focus on helping families anticipate and begin to adapt to the uncertainty that may remain after clinical genetic testing. Families who are not ready to pursue diagnostic genetic testing may consider DNA banking for future testing purposes [48].When available, predictive genetic testing should only be offered after a mutation has been identified in a family by clinical testing. In the absence of a known C9ORF72 expansion in an affected family member, a negative predictive test result is uninformative, as it cannot discriminate someone who is a true negative for the C9ORF72 expansion from someone with another known or as yet unknown pathogenic familial mutation. At-risk family members nonetheless may have many reasons for pursuing predictive genetic testing: to reduce uncertainty, to plan for the future, to make health or lifestyle changes, and to plan a family [49]. Genetic counseling should address these motivating factors and the limitations of predictive testing, including the fact that no proven health or lifestyle behaviors can reduce risk of C9ORF72-caused FTD and/or ALS. At-risk individuals should consider future financial or care planning irrespective of predictive testing.Many at-risk individuals are motivated to pursue genetic testing because of their experience with illness in the family. Issues of caregiver distress and psychological burden should be a focus of genetic counseling. International guidelines for medical ethics recommend that predictive genetic testing should be offered according to a modified Huntington's disease protocol and akin to guidelines about genetic testing for Alzheimer's disease [50–52]. is protocol involves a pre-test genetic counseling session, baseline neurologic and cognitive assessment, psychological evaluation, in-person disclosure, the presence of a support person, and post-test genetic counseling or follow-up. Predictive genetic testing should not be offered to asymptomatic minors. With the advent of clinical testing in a CLIA-approved laboratory, prenatal diagnosis and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis will soon become available.Another potential risk that should be discussed during genetic counseling for predictive testing involves genetic privacy. Although studies suggest that at-risk individuals' concern for insurance and employment discrimination based on genetic information is disproportionate to documented instances, the fear of genetic discrimination persists [53–55]. In the US, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) - a federal law that took effect in 2009 to prohibit discrimination in health insurance and employment based on genetic information [56] - should be discussed during genetic counseling. At-risk individuals may also be reassured that in addition to federal legislation many US states also have anti-genetic discrimination laws [57, 58]. However, none of the current federal or state legislation encompasses long-term care, life, or disability insurance, which should also be discussed during genetic counseling.At-risk individuals should consider the potential risk of psychological distress as the result of predictive genetic testing. Although the risk for adverse psychological effects cannot be ruled out completely, studies suggest that increased post-test distress among at-risk individuals, who electively pursue predictive testing and who first receive pre-test genetic counseling, is usually transient and not clinically significant [59]. There is also evidence that baseline distress is a better predictor of post-test counseling distress than the genetic test result itself [60]. Predictive genetic testing may have a profound impact not only on the at-risk individual but also on spouses and partners [61, 62]. This may greatly influence patterns of disclosure and nondisclosure within families [63]. Consequently, clinicians should be prepared to address the needs of both the patient and family members."
