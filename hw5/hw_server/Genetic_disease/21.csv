0,Sequencing of emerging canine distemper virus strain reveals new distinct genetic lineage in the United States associated with disease in wildlife and domestic canine populations,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an enveloped negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that produces multi-systemic disease in dogs and other terrestrial carnivores [1]. Similar to measles virus, CDV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus is highly contagious and results in immunosuppression in the host. Clinical signs associated with infection may include gastrointestinal signs (vomiting and diarrhea) and/or respiratory signs that may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection (purulent nasal discharge, coughing, dyspnea, pneumonia). The infection may progress to the central nervous system (CNS) and may result in death.Despite extensive vaccination of dogs in developed countries, recent reports suggest both re-emergence and increased activity of CDV worldwide, including the United States [2–6]. We have seen an increase in overall CDV positive samples submitted to University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine (UTCVM) Clinical Virology Lab from 5 % in 2010 to 27 % in 2013 [7].Traditionally, circulating field strains cluster into distinct clades. These distinct genotypes have been designated as genetic lineages and named based on the geographic regions where the genotypes were originally detected [2–4, 6]. While there have only been two North American lineages clearly defined, recent reports suggest at least 3 lineages (including 2 newly identified genotypes) are circulating in South America [3]. We previously sequenced regions from CDV positive samples and based on limited phylogenetic evaluation there appear to be 3–4 different “North American” genotypes currently circulating in the USA, including a new genotype of CDV we discovered circulating in Tennessee [7].Most currently circulating strains are genetically divergent from the strains used for vaccine production. Onderstepoort and Snyder Hill strains (designated America 1 lineage) were used for vaccine production in the 1950s, and the vaccines have not changed since then [8, 9]. Many have questioned the efficacy of these vaccines with reports of CDV in previously vaccinated dogs since the 1990s [10], including recent reports in Japan [11], Mexico [12], Argentina [13], and the United States [5]. There are multiple reasons vaccines may fail aside from genetic differences, such as interference of maternal antibody resulting in incomplete protection and improper handling of the vaccine [1]. However, as newly emerging strains with significant genetic diversity from the available vaccine strains are detected, changes in virulence as well as antigenicity are anticipated in light of previously reported vaccine breakthroughs.One aim of this present study was to evaluate additional archived samples to determine when this new strain first appeared, its geographic distribution, and if it is associated with the perceived increase in CDV cases from 2011 to 2013 and continuing into 2014. We then sought to investigate if this strain is conserved utilizing genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of two samples obtained from independent geographic regions, points in time and different species. We also performed initial serologic testing to evaluate presence of antigenic variation compared to a commonly used vaccine strain Onderstepoort. This type of information is necessary for future efforts toward determining vaccine efficacy.","Eighty-four of 352 samples tested from 2011 to 2013 were positive for CDV by real-time RT-PCR. Only one sample from each of 3 independent outbreaks in shelters and a pet store is included in these numbers, so the numbers actually do not reflect the total number of samples tested or the total number of positive samples. This was done to demonstrate that these positive samples were not just associated with isolated outbreaks. The majority of these samples were submitted from client-owned, young adult dogs from individual homes. Vaccination history was missing for several dogs, but most of the animals were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. Three adult dogs (ages 1, 4, and 8 years old) with complete vaccination histories were positive for CDV. Based on veterinary records, these dogs had been properly vaccinated according to vaccine guidelines and one of the dogs (8 year old) had actually been vaccinated yearly, rather than the recommended every three years schedule.Genotypes of 22 wild-type strains were previously reported [7] and are included in the numbers reported here for completeness. An additional 33 positive samples were typed for this report, including 5 samples from 2014. Genotyping of samples obtained from different geographic regions and different states revealed this new strain as the predominant strain from the majority of samples typed from 2011 to 2013 (75 % of the samples from 2011(3/4); 73 % from 2012(11/15); 86 % (24/28) of the samples from 2013), but it was not detected in samples collected in 2010 (0/5). This strain was detected in 35/39 samples typed from eastern Tennessee (between 2011 and 2013), including every county tested (10 different counties), and it was still circulating in Tennessee in 2014 (2/5). We also detected this novel strain in 1/3 samples typed from Virginia, 1/1 from South Carolina, and 1/1 from West Virginia. This strain was not detected in a limited number of samples from Canada, Washington, Texas, or Kentucky. These genotyping results using a portion of the M gene and the M-F region and compared to other published sequences are displayed as a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Phylogenetic tree comparing relatedness between M-F region of various CDV strains. The new strain described in this study represents a novel distinct clade significantly divergent from all previous sequences (lower branch). We also identified some sequences that match previously existing clades. Isolates used for genome sequencing are in bold, and their placement among the other isolates suggests that genome-level conservation is likely present in all isolates of the “new” strain. Consensus unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated within Geneious© using the Tamura-Nei model with UPGMA clustering and 1000 bootstrap replicatesFull size image
Both CDV 13–1941 and 13–2262 were sequenced to near completion including all coding sequence and intergenic space and sequences were deposited [GenBank: KJ747371 and KJ747372], respectively. Reference complete or near-complete genomes from GenBank were aligned to our two sequences and used to develop a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). Hemagglutinin (H) gene sequences from these samples were aligned with H gene sequences in GenBank and were also used to develop a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic trees based on individually extracted protein sequences for 6 genes (N, P, M, F, H, L) in the genome displayed similar relationships to the whole genome analysis and thus were not included in this manuscript. CDV 13–1941 and CDV 13–2262 outgroup in relation to the other genome sequences and form a distinct clade with extremely limited heterogeneity. A comparison of amino acid differences among hemagglutinin genes (commonly used to investigate phylogenetic relationships and evolution of CDV) [3] from different lineages supports this relationship (Table 1).Fig. 2Phylogenetic tree for genome sequences representing major geographic regions. Two genomes sequenced from the new strain (bold) diverge significantly from other sequenced genomes. The distance between the new strain is similar to the distance between recognized geographically distinct strains, as well as vaccine strains.

Fig. 3Phylogenetic tree for H gene. H gene tree also displays this new strain of CDV as a separate clade (blue) from previously identified genotypes, including the America 2 genotype (red clade). Based on H gene sequence analysis, there are at least three separate “American” clades of CDV currently circulating in the U.SFull size image

In addition to strong sequence conservation in the new genotype, genome sequencing revealed an alternate start codon for both sequences (13–1941 and 13–2262) of the fusion (F) protein, adding 75 nucleic acids (25 amino acids) to the signal peptide region relative to its closest relatives on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4). Evaluation of the hemagglutinin protein showed this strain has 7 potential N-glycosylation sites (N149, N309, N391, N422, N456, N587, N603). It lacks the site at N584 that has been found in some Asian strains [14].Fig. 4Alternate start sites for fusion (F) gene. The new strain (top two sequences) has a predicted start site 75 bp preceding that for America-2 A75/17 and Onderstepoort and 27 bp from Asia-2. This adds 25 and 9 amino acids, respectively, to the signal peptide region of the proteinFull size image
Serum obtained from 5 adult dogs prior to and following a yearly booster vaccination with a modified-live CDV vaccine showed statistical differences in serum neutralization titers when the vaccine strain virus was used in testing versus a clinical isolate of the new strain. Pre-vaccination geometric mean titers for the vaccine strain and the new genotype were 42.09 (low titer 32, high 128) and 21.11 (low titer 8, high 32), respectively. Post-vaccination geometric mean titers for the vaccine strain and the new strain were 240.37 (low titer 128, high 512) and 52.05 (low titer 8, high 64), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.05) between titers pre- and post- vaccination against the vaccine strain but not between titers pre- and post-vaccination against the new strain. There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.05) between the titers both pre-vaccination and post-vaccination when comparing the titers between the two viruses (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Serum neutralization assay. Five adult research dogs were vaccinated with a modified live virus vaccine approximately 1 year after vaccination with the same vaccine. CDV titers were determined by serum neutralization using either the new strain or the vaccine strain (Nobi). Viruses were each used at 100 TCID50 per well and the results are reported as the means of three replicates. The experiments were repeated, and the results for both experiments are included. The titers were not significantly different between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination when evaluating titers with the new strain. There was a significant difference between pre- and post-vaccination titers when testing with the vaccine strain, suggesting the memory response was specific for the vaccine virusFull size image
","This new strain of CDV is highly conserved over the period of surveillance, geographic region and host species. It appears to be widespread in the Southeast US, but samples evaluated were samples of convenience (those submitted to the diagnostic lab for CDV testing). Additional states are likely involved but more samples are required from both healthy and symptomatic animals for an epidemiological survey.Unlike a previous report that suggests strains stemming from the America-2 lineage are the dominant “American” strain in circulation [15], at least in eastern Tennessee, this new strain was predominant in 2011–2013. We consider this to be the third “contemporary” genotype that has been detected in North America.The first contemporary genotype described was America 2 (represented by red clade, Fig. 3). The term genotype has been used in the grouping of CDVs, but a formal analysis has yet to be published. Genotypes have been defined by the phylogenetic properties of the H-gene amino acid sequence. Strains in the same clade showing more than 95 % amino acid homology are considered to belong to the same genotype [14]. This is an arbitrary distinction, and depending on which sequences are used for comparison the 95 % difference does not always hold true when considering currently recognized genotypes. This is evident when comparing one of the European strains (GenBank Accession DQ494319) with a European Wildlife strain (GenBank Accession (DQ228166) versus the same comparison when using a different European strain (GenBank Accession Z47761) (Table 1).Table 2  Primer sets for genome amplificationFull size table
We performed phylogenetic evaluation of current US strains in comparison to our strains and discovered circulation of another clade that has already been described but not well-defined in the literature (yellow clade, Fig. 3). A virus belonging to this clade was initially detected by Pardo et al. in 2005 [16], sample 19876 (GenBank accession AY964110), detected in Missouri, USA in 2004 but was not defined as a new genotype at that time. Strains belonging to the clade represented by sample 19876 were also detected by additional researchers and suggested to be part of the European Wildlife lineage [5] or a subgroup thereof [17] (CDV outbreak in fishers in California (GenBank accession numbers JN836734-7), based on partial H gene sequencing. Strains grouping with the 19876 clade were later also detected in Mexico (Edomex strains) and the researchers defined the clade as a new genotype/lineage [4]. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, we concur the clade represented by sample 19876 should be recognized as a new genotype based on H gene divergence (Table 1) and viruses from this genotype are currently circulating in Tennessee and Texas in the US.). Therefore, in staying with the current genotype naming scheme, this clade represents America 3 (yellow clade, Fig. 3).Based on clade groupings and hemagglutinin amino acid divergence, we suggest this new strain circulating in the Southeast also represents a new genotype and should be called America 4 (blue clade, Fig. 3). This new America 4 genotype outgroups from other clades with similar distances as each previously described genotype does from each other. SNPs between the clades outnumber SNPs within each clade, yet CDV 13–1941 and 13–2262 have fewer differences between them than all but clonally derived isolates (only 56 nucleotide differences across the two genomes). This is unexpected as these two samples came from different species of animals, at different times and in different location with no obvious route of common exposure or transmission. It is also highly conserved, supporting the hypothesis that this novel lineage is most likely contained in a stable host reservoir with breakthrough transmission to other species.In addition to the sequence divergence from other clades, an alternate start site increasing the size of the signal peptide of the F protein has been previously reported in the Asia-2 lineage [6]; however, this new strain adds 9 additional amino acids even beyond the Asia-2 variant. It has been suggested that variations in the signal peptide region affect F protein expression and a longer signal peptide region might result in reduced F protein production and persistent infection due to evasion of the immune system [18, 19]. This observation, in addition to the highly conserved genome, fits with our hypothesis that this strain is representative of a stable reservoir. Figure 1 reveals that the hypervariable M-F region is practically identical, if not completely identical in most of the isolates typed as the new strain. This means that the two genomes we sequenced are unlikely to be coincidentally conserved and the other isolates are, in all probability, equally conserved at the genomic level.A virus capable of infecting and transmitting in wildlife yet not causing severe disease in a large number of infected animals would be under less selective pressure and show reduced genomic divergence between isolates, as we observed in our data. Furthermore, if this strain is significantly divergent from vaccine strains (which is also shown in our data/Figures), it may be capable of vaccine escape which is supported by our data from vaccinated dogs and our serum neutralization testing. The exact mechanism of vaccine protection in dogs with respect to CDV is unknown. Therefore we do not know what mutations, or combination of mutations, give rise to vaccine escape and host adaptation for this strain. However, if it is well-adapted in wildlife, it follows that infection in domestic dogs would be inefficient and/or infrequent. Why exactly this strain is only recently causing disease in dogs if it has been in wildlife long enough to become a reservoir is unknown; it may have been around prior to our discoveries yet undetected due to lack of genetic evaluation of strains. However, the lack of diversity in a hypervariable region from multiple dogs suggests this is a newly introduced strain.We believe the stable host reservoir is likely the endemic wildlife population. The virus is highly labile outside of the host, so cross-species transmission occasionally occurs, thus the virus could be maintained in wildlife populations between outbreaks [20]. We have detected this strain in raccoons and foxes, as well as three dogs with a history of recent direct raccoon exposure. Raccoons, which are among the most common wildlife species found in cities and towns, are considered a secondary reservoir of CDV and spillover of infection from domestic dogs with spillback from raccoons is well documented [1].While there have recently been multiple reports of new genotypes/lineages, questions remain as to whether the genetic differences represent significant differences in antigenicity. It has been suggested that changes in the glycan shield may result in vaccine escape mechanisms. However, comparative neutralization studies have shown that fully glycosylated and de-glycosylated wild-type viruses are neutralized with equal efficiency [21]. It was also demonstrated that only 5 of the N-glycosylation sites (N149, N391, N422, N456, and N587) are actually used by the virus and this glycosylation pattern has been highly conserved in wild-type strains. This argues against a glycan shield escape mechanism for CDV, and the presence of N309 detected in this new strain and in other recent wild-type strains, as well as N584 in some Asian strains, is meaningless [21].CDV is currently recognized as a single serotype [22]. However, preliminary evaluation of neutralization titers comparing this strain to one of the America 1 type vaccine strains showed significant differences (Fig. 5). Neutralizing antibodies are often used as a substitute marker for protection [23], with a neutralization titer of ≥ 32 generally considered protective [24]. Evaluation of the titers from this study, in light of this cut-off value, suggests all 5 dogs would not have been considered protected pre-booster, and one dog would not have been considered protected post-vaccination when evaluating neutralization titers with this new strain. All the dogs would have been considered to have a protective titer both pre- and post-vaccination when evaluating the antibody response with the Onderstepoort vaccine strain. These results should be considered from a diagnostic standpoint with regard to which virus strain or strains should be used for routine serum neutralization testing for dogs.The extent to which antigenic variation is leading to vaccine failure is unknown. This new strain has been associated with disease in 3 properly vaccinated adult dogs. All three dogs were euthanized due to severe clinical disease. Two of the dogs were necropsied and histologic findings were consistent with CDV infection. Unfortunately, sera from these dogs were not available for antibody testing. While it is possible these dogs were vaccine non-responders, it would not be expected based on the percentage of these animals seen in the general population (approximately 1/5000 dogs, http://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/WSAVA_OwnerGuidelines_September2010.pdf), and the fact that these dogs were all different breeds and unrelated.Cell-mediated immunity must also be considered with regard to vaccine protection. This was not evaluated in this study, but presence of a neutralizing titer correlates with the presence of a T-cell response, though they are not well correlated quantitatively [23]. A protective cellular immunity can be present in the absence of a detectable antibody-mediated response. A strong cellular immunity causes viral elimination but a delayed or absent lymphocyte-mediated response results in viral persistence in the CNS [25]. Challenge studies with this new strain would best determine whether dogs are protected from the new strain via cross-protection or if the new strain is genetically distinct enough to evade the vaccine but that was beyond the scope of this project.Critical CDV-specific herd immunity resulting from low vaccination rates may contribute to outbreaks [22]. Vaccine histories were unknown for some of these animals, but the majority of the cases were in dogs with incomplete vaccination or no vaccination. This suggests herd immunity is low due to reduced vaccination rates. This has likely contributed to the emergence of this new strain. Whether there is also reduced protection in vaccinated dogs as a result of extended vaccination intervals is unknown. The issue of duration of protective immunity maintained by booster vaccination every 3 years for CDV may have to be reevaluated in light of the emergence of new variants of CDV [5]. The veterinary profession should weigh the risks of side-effects due to over-vaccination against the risk of a decreased herd immunity with the re-emergence of epidemics as a consequence [26]. Maintenance of high vaccination rates using efficacious vaccines that induce a solid, resilient immunity must still be given the highest priority in control of distemper [22]. Our data suggests that ongoing surveillance should be conducted to detect and analyze new and emerging strains of CDV that may facilitate vaccine evasion.","There is a newly detected lineage of CDV circulating in the Southeastern portion of the United States. It is genetically distinct from all previously identified genotypes, yet highly conserved within its own lineage. Continued and broadened surveillance, including wildlife, will determine the impact of this genotype in comparison to other circulating genotypes. While there have been vaccine breaks associated with this genotype, vaccination remains the best way to manage CDV in the absence of a specific treatment for this virus."
1,The value of animal models in predicting genetic susceptibility to complex diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,"The history of genome-wide mapping of disease-causing genes began in 1980, when linkage analysis by use of anonymous genetic markers was suggested as a method for conducting 'forward genetics' analyses (hypothesis-free mapping starting from a trait of interest) [1]. This soon led to successful identification of several disease-causing genes, often providing the first information on disease mechanisms.In principal, there are two approaches to genetic mapping: linkage and association analysis (reviewed in [2]). Linkage analysis is based on inheritance of chromosomal fragments within families with affected and unaffected individuals. It allows genome-wide mapping with limited resources, but it can generally only map loci into large genomic regions that span hundreds of genes and, despite great success in monogenic diseases, linkage analysis seems to be of limited use in mapping of complex traits. Association studies compare large unrelated groups of patients with the healthy population to find regions that are overrepresented in patients. This increases mapping precision dramatically but it requires large repositories of patient materials and very closely spaced genetic markers, creating a need for correction for multiple testing, which raises the threshold for claiming statistical significance. Until recently, candidate gene studies were the only realistic way to utilize patient materials for association studies. The major disadvantage of candidate studies is the need for a starting hypothesis to choose candidates. The most interesting prospect of gene mapping, however, is that hypothesis-free mapping can point to previously unknown and unexpected disease pathways.Neither of these strategies has been successful in mapping genes that control complex diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in humans. Mapping in animal models therefore emerged as an attractive alternative. Choosing candidates identified by positional cloning in animal models combines the high power of candidate studies with the benefits of hypothesis-free mapping.The traditional strategy to map genes in animals is to intercross two inbred strains that differ in the trait of interest for at least two generations, thereby allowing chromosome regions to segregate, and permitting linkage analysis in a setting with minimal genetic and environmental variation (Figure 1). Not only is the mapping power superior to that in human linkage analysis, but also the identified loci can be isolated on a fixed genetic background to confirm the position of the locus by backcrossing to one of the parental strains for several generations to create a congenic strain (an inbred strain with only a defined genetic region originating from another strain). The congenic region can then be minimized by further backcrossing, checking each generation to make sure that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) is still within the congenic fragment, until only the causative gene remains.Figure 1Strategies in animal models. Presented are the most common strategies employed to identify and validate a candidate gene using animal models. GWA, genome-wide association; QTL, quantitative trait locus.Full size imageAs in the tale of the tortoise and the hare, human genetics has been regarded as fast but unreliable, whereas animal genetics is slow and laborious but likely to find the gene sooner or later. However, even though a few victories have been won by the tortoise, thanks to denser genotyping and considerably larger patient cohorts that allow near genome-wide association (GWA) mapping, human genetics has also started to produce strong candidate genes for complex diseases. In light of this success, we must consider how best to use animal models in the future; is there still value in identifying the genes that affect susceptibility to disease in these species as well?Clearly, major challenges remain in human genetics that can be resolved in animals. Most genes with medium or small effects still need the focused and strategic work of animal geneticists to reveal their secrets, and only animal genetics studies allow controlled, repeated experiments that can determine causality without doubt. Most important, however, is that although human genetics often faces dead ends because the function of the identified gene is unknown, animal models allow us to investigate the role played by the genes and to perform conclusive experiments to investigate disease mechanisms and develop more precise treatments.","The advent of GWA in humans ushered in a new era in disease genetics. GWA studies have been very successful in identifying with statistical rigour the genes that are responsible for several complex diseases, including arthritis, which is reviewed in detail in other articles in this series (for another review, also see [3]). However, at this stage the human GWA studies still wrestle with severe problems and limitations; this is particularly apparent in arthritis studies, where success has been more moderate than for many other complex diseases.The major problem is the strict correction for multiple testing needed to exclude false positives after performing hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of tests. It is therefore estimated that materials from tens of thousands of patients and control individuals are needed to identify the majority of genetic effects [4]. Studies combined with retesting in other materials is likely to allow confirmation of the strongest of these associations in the near future, but most are likely to elude mapping. This will be especially true for diseases such as RA, for which studies thus far suggest that the patient population must be stratified into smaller patient groups, resulting in smaller bodies of patient materials and even larger numbers of tests [5, 6]. This problem will be even worse if interactions are to be addressed. This is an important issue because it is likely that much of the genetic influence is through patterns of interacting genes.Another issue is the limited possibilities for follow-up experiments in humans. Many loci found by association mapping are located in intergenic regions, including two of the strongest loci for RA, namely TRAF1-C5 and TNFAIP3-OLIG3, making it difficult to establish causality [7, 8]. TRAF1 and TNFAIP3 have been favoured as candidates based on previous knowledge of their function in tumour necrosis factor signalling [9, 10], which is known to be important in RA (reviewed in [11]). Although it is likely that these genes truly are involved in the pathogenesis of RA, this remains to be proven; as for candidate studies, this type of reasoning is counter to one of the main aims: hypothesis-free generation of new knowledge. Interestingly, C5 has already been implicated, based on studies conducted in mice [12–14], and it should therefore be considered an equally likely candidate. Similar problems have been apparent for half a century in elucidating the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, in which the genes may operate as linked units, haplotypes. More precise phenotypic information and biological knowledge is needed to understand these genetic regions.","The value of mapping in animals is dependent on there being good models of human diseases. In this review we focus on RA, a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease that is known to depend on multiple genes and environmental factors. The disease models should therefore preferably be correspondingly polygenic and dependent on environment. There are a number of available animal models for RA that all mimic various aspects of the disease, possibly reflecting disease pathways that operate in different subgroups of RA patients. Thus, all of these models can be valuable under certain conditions, depending on the question that is to be addressed.","If an antigen is known to induce disease, then this permits studies of the antigen-specific response and allows mapping of the genes involved. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is induced by the major collagen found in cartilage, namely collagen type II (CII), emulsified in adjuvant [15, 16]. Disease develops 2 to 3 weeks after immunization in susceptible strains (H-2q or H-2r) [17]. CIA is the most widely used model for studying arthritis pathology and for testing for novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics [18].Proteoglycan (aggrecan)-induced arthritis (PGIA), characterized by a progressive disease course, is induced by cartilage proteoglycans. PGIA presents with 100% incidence in BALB/c mice (H-2d), which are normally resistant to CIA [19], and manifest in substrains of C3H (H-2k) [20]. CIA and PGIA are the two most commonly used RA models for QTL mapping in mice. Both models are complex highly polygenic diseases that are dependent on both B and T cells [21–24] and are both associated with MHC class II molecules (MHCII) and a large number of both common and unique non-MHC loci (Figure 2) [17, 25]. Both CIA and PGIA are believed to have relevance to human disease because antibodies to both CII and proteoglycan in RA patients have been identified [26–28].Figure 2Overview of CIA, PGIA and STIA loci mapped in mouse. CIA, collagen-induced arthritis; PGIA, proteoglycan (aggrecan)-induced arthritis; STIA, serum transfer-induced arthritis.Full size imageOther cartilage structures that can induce arthritis include cartilage oligomeric matrix protein [29, 30] and type XI collagen [31].Collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) is induced by injection of specific monoclonal CII antibodies [32]. The model was developed based on the finding that serum from arthritic mice or RA patients could transfer arthritis to naïve mice [33, 34]. CAIA resembles CIA but is more acute and has a rapid onset, a few days after injection. Normally, the disease heals after a month and mice remain healthy. The CAIA model is unique because it is independent of MHC and T and B cells [35, 36]. Instead, neutrophils and macrophages are recruited and activated independent of the adaptive immune system, as a result of antibodies binding to the cartilage surface and fixing complement [36]. This allows investigation of effector mechanisms without involvement of the priming phase.A number of bacteria also have the capacity to induce arthritis in animals. Mice infected with Borrelia develop a disease similar to RA (B. burgdorferi associated arthritis) [37] and Staphyolococcus aureus causes septic arthritis in both rats and mice [38, 39]. Bacterial components, such as cell wall fragments, DNA and heat shock proteins, can also induce arthritis by themselves, one example being the streptococcal cell wall induced arthritis model [40]. In rats, exposure to heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in adjuvant results in Mycobacterium induced-arthritis, often referred to as adjuvant-induced arthritis [41]. This model was developed in 1947 when it was found that a mixture of mineral oils, emulsifier and mycobacteria – namely complete Freund's adjuvant – was a potent immunological adjuvant. It was later found that a similar mixture but excluding mycobacteria (incomplete Freund's adjuvant) also had arthritogenic capacity (oil-induced arthritis) [42]. In addition, some mineral oils by themselves had the capacity to induce arthritis, including squalene [43] and pristane [44].Pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats highly resembles many aspects of the human disease because it is chronic, symmetrical, and serum rheumatoid factor is present and radiographic changes are apparent [44, 45]. Even though pristane does not contain peptides that could bind to MHC, PIA has been shown to be T-cell driven and dependent on MHCII [46], suggesting that the arthritogenic T cells recognize a self-antigen on the MHC complex, but thus far no such antigen has been identified.Genetically altered mice as models of arthritisThere are also animal models that are produced using transgenic techniques, and develop arthritis spontaneously, which can be used to map modifier genes. Examples are IL-1 receptor antagonist knockouts, IL-1 over-expressing mice, gp130 knock-ins and human tumour necrosis factor-α transgenic mice [47–50]. K/B×N mice express a transgenic T-cell receptor (KRN) and the NOD-derived Ag7 MHCII allele, and develop severe arthritis spontaneously [51]. The autoantigen is the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [52], but inflammation is restricted to the joints, and the disease exhibits many of the characteristics of human RA. Autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in this model, because arthritis can be transferred to a wide range of recipients with serum from K/B×N mice (serum transfer-induced arthritis) [53]. Arthritis can also be induced by injection of recombinant glucose-6-phosphate isomerase in mice [54].In addition, there are spontaneous models that develop arthritis because of a single mutation. These models can be derived as a result of a spontaneous mutation or following N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis. The causative mutation can then be positionally cloned by means of linkage analysis (Figure 1).Genetic modifications of animalsWith emerging knowledge of the major genes that underlie human disease and improved animal models, it seems straightforward to investigate the in vivo function of these genes in the animal models. To this end, the particular genes can be humanized or modified in mice and the effect of the specific mutations on disease development investigated (Figure 1). Of particular use will be new technologies to modify the genome, which will allow researchers to introduce genes, mutate genes in specific tissues and express proteins flagged with various markers. There are, however, some significant drawbacks that have thus far limited the use of this technology, and these need to be highlighted. First, it is essential that the modifications are dependent on the genetic context (the new genetic modifications will interact with other genes in the genome, specifically mouse genes). Second, to conduct conclusive experiments and compare them between different laboratories, the genetic background must be inbred and standardized. Finally, modifications to the genome lead to artifacts that interfere with interpretation of the results. Clearly, to use genetic modifiactions we must obtain better knowledge about the genomic control of the disease in question in mice. We first discuss some of the problems that genetic modifications may cause.Although transgenic or genetic knockout strategies are appealing, being relatively fast and cost efficient, it is important to appreciate that they carry a high risk of artifacts. Despite the efficiency of inserting a mutation that completely disrupts the function of a gene, most genetic factors in common complex diseases are expected to be noncrucial, coding single nucleotide polymorphisms or expression differences [55]. Complete elimination of a gene does not necessarily have the same effect as a smaller change that affects, for instance, expression kinetics or binding to a target molecule. Accordingly, studies of knockout mice have identified phenotypes that are fundamentally different from what was expected from the naturally occurring locus. This is clearly seen in the case of the Ncf1 gene. Mice with a spontaneous mutation in this gene, resulting in a truncated protein, exhibit increased susceptibility to models of arthritis and even develop arthritis spontaneously [56], whereas knockout of Ncf1 results in chronic granulomatous disease with severe infections as a consequence [57]. The same problems apply to other types of transgenes in which a construct is expressed outside its normal context, possibly with dramatic effects on gene regulation and protein expression. This can also be true in humanized mice, in which human genetic variants have been introduced in an artificial genetic interactive environment. Nevertheless, these mice can be extremely useful in clarifying specific questions. For example, humanized mice have successfully been used to investigate the individual roles of MHC class II molecules (MHCII) in arthritis and were proven to be useful in identifying T-cell epitopes (reviewed in [58]).Another important issue when studying polygenic diseases is that transgenics can normally not be made directly in the strain that will be used for experiments. Transgenic mice are instead made in embryonic stem cells, usually from the 129 or C57BL/6 strains, and backcrossed to the strain of interest, thus creating a mixed genome with a 129 or C57BL/6 region surrounding the insert. Even after 10 generations of backcrossing, there is almost 40% risk that a locus 10 cM from the targeted gene is still within this fragment, a region that could contain hundreds of genes [59]. Based on findings from mappings of CIA in mouse, it is quite likely that this congenic fragment will contain QTLs that affect the trait, making it impossible to know whether the phenotype truly originates from the transgene (Figure 2) [60–62].Such linked QTLs have proven to be a problem in several studies. For example, the osteopontin (Opn) gene was suggested to be involved in autoimmunity based on phenotyping of a knockout strain, but it was later revealed that another Opn knockout had no such phenotype, and that the effect was probably due to liked genes in the 129 fragment [63]. More recently, contradictory data about the role of IL-21 in autoimmunity and differentiation of T-helper-17 cells have led to a similar discussion. In fact, none of the studies using IL-21 or IL-21 receptor knockout mice were set up such that the influence of other genes could be excluded [64]. This is especially problematic if the aim is to confirm the mapping of a candidate gene. Random insertion may affect the usage of the gene whereas targeted insertion will place it within a congenic region that might contain the QTL studied, yielding false-positive confirmation (Figure 1). Most importantly, there is a risk that only hypothesis-confirming results will be reported, without any correction for multiple testing."
2,Genetic epidemiology: Approaches to the genetic analysis of rheumatoid arthritis,"William Heberden in 1806 was probably the first to suggest ""some degree of heredity"" for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subsequent twin- and family-based studies have shown that both genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to RA, leading to its description as a complex or multifactorial condition. There have been many attempts to elucidate both the genetic and environmental components, but the aetiology remains largely unclear. In common with many other autoimmune chronic inflammatory conditions, associations with genes of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex have been described. The original observation by Stastny in 1978 [1] of an association with the HLA DRB1 locus in 80 patients has become one of the few examples of a consistently associated gene in RA. Estimates suggest that the HLA locus probably accounts for no more than a third of the total genetic component of susceptibility [2], leaving the majority still to be determined. This review considers some of the approaches currently available for the investigation of the non-HLA genetic basis of susceptibility to RA.","Complex diseases do not lend themselves to parametric linkage analysis, as this technique depends on following the inheritance of genetic markers in extended pedigrees to look for cosegregation of marker alleles in affected individuals, under a defined model of inheritance. RA clearly does not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, and large, extended pedigrees are difficult or impossible to ascertain. Thus, until recently, the search for RA disease genes was targeted to potential candidate genes tested in disease-association studies.","Nonparametric (model-free) linkage analysis can be carried out on small, nuclear families, such as affected sibling pairs (ASPs), provided sufficient families can be collected. Technological developments in the early 1990s making possible high-throughput genotyping of informative markers (microsatellites; simple repetitive DNA sequences, highly polymorphic between individuals in terms of the number of repeats) combined with the collection of large numbers of small nuclear families led to groups in Europe [2], Japan [3], the USA [4], and the UK (Worthington J, unpublished data) to embark upon whole-genome screens in search of RA disease genes. This exciting approach of systematically scanning the genome for regions containing disease loci provides the opportunity to identify previously undescribed genes that would never be found by the candidate-gene approach.The results published to date all represent the first stage of genome screens, in which many potential loci have been identified, but as yet, with the exception of DRB1, none has reached the level of statistical significance (P < 2.2 × 10–5) recommended for such approaches [5]. As a result, many of these loci will turn out to be false positives, and only replication studies in independent cohorts will determine the true regions of linkage. Further, the individual studies published so far are limited by a lack of power to exclude regions or to detect loci with modest effects – the likely scenario in RA – and this may require the use of as many as 2000 ASPs [6]. All groups are collecting more families, and plans are already in place to carry out meta-analysis of the data, which may prove to be the most effective way to achieve the necessary power, if the differences between the cohorts are taken into account. We must expect, then, to wait some time before whole-genome screens in RA accurately direct us to disease loci.On a more encouraging note, even in the initial publications, a number of promising loci have been detected in more than one study. This is perhaps particularly surprising in view of the relative lack of concordance between whole-genome screens reported for some other conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia). This lack of agreement has, unfortunately, led to some scepticism about whole-genome screens but actually does not suggest an inherent flaw in the approach: it is more likely a reflection of heterogeneity between the cohorts studied. The possibility of both phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity in complex diseases is a potential difficulty that must be taken into account when attempting to define the genetic basis of a complex disease, whether using linkage- or nonlinkage-based approaches.Establishing evidence of linkage using ASP methods is just the first step, and one of the greatest challenges to molecular genetics is to identify a disease gene from a region of linkage. The size of an initial linkage region may be many tens of centimorgans, and recent publications have shown that chance variation in the location estimate is substantial [7,8], suggesting that it may be necessary to follow up a large area on either side of the linkage peak. Experience so far suggests that even with fine mapping using a dense marker map, it has not been possible to narrow down regions to less than 10 cM in any complex disease. As regions of this size may contain hundreds of genes, it is vital to define a smaller region by linkage-disequilibrium mapping before moving on to target genes.","Family-based association testsA large area of linkage may be narrowed down by using methods that detect association in the presence of linkage. As association between a marker and a disease locus depends upon the presence of linkage disequilibrium, in an outbred population, association can be detected only over a small distance, typically less than 1 cM. A number of family-based association methods have been proposed, the most commonly used being the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) [9].The test examines the transmission of potential disease alleles from a parent who is heterozygous for the marker to an affected offspring. It is a test of association only in the presence of linkage, and because family members act as controls, spurious associations due to population differences do not arise. The original test uses a single affected offspring and both parents. A number of extensions to the original TDT have been proposed that allow both parents and unaffected sibling to be analysed, making maximum use of incomplete nuclear family data. It is now also possible to analyse dichotomous and quantitative variables (e.g. age at onset) and to include covariates (e.g. exposure to smoking) in the analysis. An extensive list of available methods and software can be found at the Genetic analysis web page at Rockefeller University (http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/).Tests are available for both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiallelic markers such as microsatellites. As the TDT is dependent upon the number of informative transmissions, microsatellite markers are often more useful. If 100 parents are genotyped, 80 informative transmissions will be expected for a microsatellite marker with 80% heterozygosity, whereas the maximum heterozygosity measure for a SNP is only 50%. However, at least two multilocus haplotype methods have been developed for the TDT, which should overcome the low information content of single SNPs by combining up to four SNPs in a single haplotype.At present, there are few published studies in RA using TDT methods. Recent papers have looked at regions of linkage and used the TDT to test for association, leading to more significant results than were observed using linkage [10,11]. The TDT has become a very versatile methodology, allowing a range of family structures, marker types, and phenotype data to be analysed simultaneously. This versatility, coupled with the increased power of an association-based method, will inevitably lead to increased use of the TDT in the search for RA susceptibility genes.Case–control studiesLinkage studies are resource intensive and dependent on the availability of large family collections. It is therefore not surprising that many investigators have chosen to target candidate genes directly. These studies are usually association based, using case–control cohorts. A number of polymorphisms in genes thought to be involved in RA pathology have been investigated, but results have often been conflicting. An example is the interleukin(IL)-1 gene cluster, containing IL-1B, IL-1A, and the IL-1-receptor antagonist. A number of studies [e.g. 12] have suggested that polymorphisms in this gene cluster are associated with RA, whereas others have shown no association [e.g. 13]. This apparent inconsistency may be explained by a number of factors, including clinical heterogeneity (associations are often only shown with certain subsets of disease), genetic heterogeneity (it should not be unexpected to find ethnic differences in associations), and study design (small, underpowered sample sizes, poor quality control of genotyping data, and inappropriate selection of controls will all contribute to inconsistent findings).Despite the potential difficulties, association studies have the significant advantage over linkage studies of having greater power to detect small effects. For example, only 123 affected individuals in a case–control study would be required to detect a genetic relative risk of 2 for a disease allele with a frequency of 10% with 80% power, at P = 0.05 [6]. Although the genetic relative risk associated with an unknown disease gene cannot be established accurately, there is much evidence that no disease gene in RA will have an effect greater than HLA and that some RA genes may well have a genetic relative risk no greater than twofold. In addition to offering increased power, the move towards genotyping SNPs rather than microsatellites means that case–control studies are more efficient.Even when reasonable sample sizes are used, applying a significance level of P = 0.05 will still lead to 1 in 20 results being false positives. In order to minimize type 1 error, it would be desirable to design studies with sufficient power to detect an effect at a level of significance corrected for the number of markers or genes to be tested. The obvious drawback of this rigorous approach is that this sort of correction for multiple tests will result in unrealistic sample sizes. For this reason, it is perhaps more appropriate to accept a P value of <0.05 in an initial study and to replicate the result in an independent data set [14].The selection of appropriately matched controls has also been the subject of discussion within the community of geneticists. Ethnically unmatched controls may lead to positive results due to population stratification. If two populations have subtle genetic differences and the cases come predominantly from one population, positive associations will be observed but the true association will be with the population rather than the disease. In reality, the extent of this problem is unclear, because false-positive results occur for many reasons. The problem has recently been addressed by Pritchard and Rosenberg [15], who propose using a panel of unassociated markers to test for population stratification within the cohort under investigation."
3,Management and prognosis of juvenile arthritis on the model of molecular genetic testing of gene p53,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a multifactor chronic inflammatory joints disease that is characterized by long progressive course leading to development of contractures and loss of joint´s function. Currently, there are only several laboratory and radiological predictors of unfavorable prognosis of JIA. In recent years, scientists studied the molecular basis of the development and maintenance of chronic inflammation in the joint. Reduced sensitivity of cells to apoptosis is one the possible mechanisms contribution to progressive inflammation in synovial membrane. Polymorphisms Arg72Pro 4 exon, ins/del 16bp intron 3 and G13964C intron 6 gene P53 may change expression gene P53 and functional activity this protein, main factor of intrinsic apoptosis pathway (P.Dumont et al 2003; A.Sallivan et al, A.Ghosh et al 2004).","Identify predicting factors of course and outcome of JIA in children by based on comprehensive analysis of the clinical and instrumental, laboratory and molecular genetic tests.","Clinical, serological, x-ray manifestations, ultrasound and MRI data were analyzed in 126 children with JIA. Three polymorphisms gene P53 were detected by PCR-RFLP. 60 healthy children without family history of any autoimmune disease were controls.","We haven't revealed significant differences distribution genotypes of Arg72Pro ex4, ins/del16bp in3 and G13964C in6 gene P53 between children with JIA and controls. But girls with oligo- and polyarthritis with genotypes containing three or more minor polymorphic variant 72Pro, ins16bp, 13964C gene P53 in any combination were with more severe variant articular lesion. By means of ROC-curve analysis and regression methods were assessed the contribution of molecular genetic, clinical, instrumental and laboratory factors on the disease with a view to determine the prognostic significance of these factors. The presence of erosions of the joints and carrier of genotypes containing allele 72Pro gene P53 were found in girls with JIA like highly information signs of prognosis ""active"" arthritis and the presence of erosions and debut JIA under the age of 3 years old - for boys. Also two signs were obtained for predicting remission in girls with JIA it´s early treatment by DMARS and carrier of homogenous genotype containing allele Arg72 gene P53."
4,Inflence of clinical and genetic characteristics on ability to achive and maintain remission in JIA patients on etanercept treatment,There are no official published recommendations how and when to stop treatment with biologics when remission achieved.,Primary objective of this study was to evaluate influence of JIA subtype and duration of metotrexate (MTX) and steroids treatment on time to achieve and ability to maintain remission in JIA patients on biologic treatment. The second aim was to establish if there is contribution of tumor necrosis factor ά (TNFά–308) promoter and FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism on clinical outcome and possibility to discontinue treatment in JIA patients treated with biologics.,"68 JIA patients treated with etanercept from Serbian biologic registry were included and retrospective data analysis performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and TNFά–308 promoter and FokI VDR polymorphism was evaluated using the PCR-RFLP method. Disease subtypes, activity and treatment efficacy were collected during six years follow-up period in intervals after commencing etanercept: 6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter. Disease remission, as a condition to stop biologic treatment, was defined using Wallace and all criteria [1].","At enrolment JIA patients mean age were 183.34±60,58 months, disease duration 70.29±44,57 months, average dose of MTX 13.85±4.47 mg/m2/week. Etanercept treatment could be stopped after 42.66±21.64 months with sustained remission during the next 30.33±21.04 months. Therapy resistant patients required higher doses of MTX for a longer period, with statistically significance in systemic JIA (15.97±3.56 vs. 13.15±4.55, p=0.016). Remission in this patients was shorter and they needed retreatment with biologics (16.31±18.55 vs. 35.80±19.53, p=0.001) due to disease worsening. Treatment inefficacy was present in systemic JIA with the longest etanercept treatment 59.50±5.97 and shortest remission 17.67%±9.82, while etanercept therapy was the most effective in RF- JIA patients. There was no statistically significant difference in cumulative dose of steroids in different JIA subtypes. The distribution of TNFά–308 (GG, GA, AA) and FokI VDR genotypes (FF,Ff, ff) was not significantly different among JIA subtypes. After six years follow up period 37(54.5%) patients were in remission (20 patients with FF+GA and 17 patients with Ff+GA polymorphism). Associate presence of FF+GA genotype was present more frequently in patients who needed longer treatment and have had shorter remission time."
5,Genetic aspects of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in a family with multiple affected members: a research article,"Idiopathic scoliosis is a structural lateral curvature of the spine with a rotatory component deviation in an otherwise healthy individual. These individuals present no known neurological, muscular disorders or other diseases [1] Radiography exam shows no vertebral alterations, while present with curves of more than 10°, as determined by the Cobb method [1]. Idiopathic scoliosis is one of the most frequent deformity involving the spine, with reports of its incidence in populations worldwide from 0.5% to 10%. Scoliosis progresses during the growth phase and can be classified into three categories according to the age at which the deformity is detected: infant, prior to three years of age; juvenile, between three and 10 years-old (or at the onset of puberty); and adolescent, when it appears after 10 years of age or after the onset of puberty [2].Lonstein (1994) reported that the prevalence of idiopathic scoliosis in radiographic studies in school populations varied between 0.3 and 15.3%; however, considering only curves greater than 10°, the rates decreased to values between 1.5 and 3%. In curves greater than 20°, prevalence occurred between 0.3 and 0.5% and in curves greater than 30° the rate was between 0.2 and 0.3% [2].The pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis remains unknown and different factors have been suggested as causal. Among these, the following should be highlighted: deviation from the standard growth pattern, neuromuscular or conjunctive tissue alterations, asymmetric growth of the limbs and trunk, alterations in the sagittal configuration of the spine; and environmental factors [2–5].Hereditary factors can also determine the etiology of the disease; however, the pattern of inheritance remains unknown. Autosomal dominant, X-linked and multifactorial patterns of inheritances have been reported [1–3, 5–8]. Segregation analysis has suggested a single gene as major determinant of idiopathic scoliosis in patients with curves equal to or greater than 11° (Axenovich et al. 1999). Other studies have suggested possible chromosome regions related to the etiology of idiopathic scoliosis, including a genetic locus for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis linked to chromosome 19p13.3., considering affected members as those individuals with curves greater than 10°, without reference to the presence of consanguinity [1, 3, 7–9].The objective of this study is to determine a specific chromosome region related to idiopathic scoliosis in a family with multiple affected members and a high rate of consanguinity in a small town in the outback of the State of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil.","We investigated 57 members of a four-generation family of Brazilian ancestry. Each family member who agreed to participate was clinically examined. Characterization of family members included sex, age and physical and ethnical characteristics, such as biotype, as well as the degree of deformity determined by the Cobb method using standing anteroposterior spinal radiographs. All of the members were skeletally mature at the time of assessment.The criteria for selecting the family included clinical and radiological diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis in at least seven family members with scoliotic curves greater than 15° according to the Cobb method. The family selected for this research was chosen from a previous study involving 100 families of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, conducted by Wajchenberg et al (2005) [5].The proband underwent surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in 2002, due to a curve of 75°. An investigation into the patient's family was conducted by means of interviews and affected members were verified in Sao Paulo and in the home town of the patient's family, Sao Jose de Piranhas, in the outback of the State of Paraiba.Family members were divided into three groups: affected individuals, unaffected and suspected disease. Affected members were classified as those presenting clinical and radiological (curvature greater than 15°) signs characteristic of the disease. Individuals suspected of having the disease showed clinical and radiological signs suggestive of idiopathic scoliosis (curvature between 5 and 14°), while unaffected individuals showed no signs of the disease. The individuals were submitted to peripheral blood collection for genomic DNA extraction and subsequent linkage analysis, using microsatellite markers from the ABI PRISM® Linkage Mapping Set, Version 2, (Applied Biosystems). The MERLIN program was used for statistical analyses in order to calculate the lods (logarithm of the odds ratios) scores, based on the consideration that the family presented an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance estimated in 35% and allele frequency of 0.01%. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.","Evaluation of familial history of the individuals studied revealed an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission (Figures 1 and 2), with 9 affected members, 12 unaffected members and 36 members showing some characteristics of the disease, classified as suggestive of idiopathic scoliosis.Figure 1

Figure 2
Heredogram of the maternal lineage of the proband (III-29).Full size image
Consanguinity was determined and in the heredogram constructed, each family member was assigned a bold underlined number. Linkage analysis was unable to determine a specific chromosome region related to the disease in this study according to the tables (additional file 1) and graphics (additional file 2) from chromosomes 1 to 22.","The etiology and pattern of inheritance for the transmission of idiopathic scoliosis remain unknown, though studies of families with multiple affected members suggest that a single gene or limited number of genes are linked to the disease. Recent studies have used an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission, with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, to conduct linkage studies [1, 3, 8, 9].This pattern was also observed in the family studied in this study; however, the high level of consanguinity observed should be highlighted, as well as the fact that the family originates from a small town of approximately 15,000 inhabitants, for this reason, we also have done a linkage analysis considering an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and allele frequency of 0.01%. Nevertheless, we did not find any specific chromosome region associated with the disease.The criteria for characterization of an individual as affected by the disease in the literature includes the presence of scoliosis equal to or greater than 10° as determined by the Cobb method, with vertebral rotation observed in radiographs realized in the frontal position in orthostasis [1–3, 5–9].Axenovich et al (1999) conducted segregation analysis on 101 families with idiopathic scoliosis patients and observed a monogenic, dominant pattern of inheritance, using a diallelic model, considering individuals with curvature greater than 11° as affected [6]. Wise et al (2000) studied families whose probands presented curves equal to or greater than 50° or who required corrective surgery. Among the families analyzed in previous works, expressive variation was observed in the spinal curve values of affected patients, which suggests the possible influence of other genetic and environmental factors [8]. In the present study, we analyzed affected individuals with a physical exam compatible with idiopathic scoliosis and radiographs indicating curvature equal to or greater than 15°. Individuals suspected of having the disease showed some clinical sign and radiographs suggestive of idiopathic scoliosis, though a curvature greater than 10° was not considered obligatory. Thus, it was possible to construct a heredogram with an autosomal dominant characteristic. The family studied showed characteristics typical of idiopathic scoliosis; notably the individuals were Caucasian and the female members were predominantly affected (100%).Since 2000, familial studies have been conducted in an attempt to map the chromosome regions responsible for idiopathic scoliosis. Wise et al (2000) suggested that regions on chromosomes 6, 10 and 18 were related to idiopathic scoliosis [8]. Salehi et al (2002) investigated three generations of one family of Italian origin with 11 affected members who presented curves between 10 and 20° and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with complete penetrance [7]. Their study mapped a region of approximately 20 cM on chromosome 17p11 linked to idiopathic scoliosis. In the same year, Chan et al (2002) identified a region of 5.2 cM in the region 19p13 and reported a secondary candidate region on chromosome 2, while studying seven Chinese families with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and probands with curves between 20 and 55° that required the use of a brace or surgical treatment [9]. In 2005, Alden et al also reported a region on chromosome 19 with potential links to idiopathic scoliosis, when studying 1198 individuals from 202 families that presented at least 2 affected members with curves equal to or greater than 11°. However, correlation with region 19p13 only occurred when analyzing families with probands with curvature equal to or greater than 30° [3]. Ocaka et al (2008) studied 25 unrelated multiplex adolescent idiopathic scoliosis families [1]. Of these, 24 families were Caucasian of British descent, and one was of African-Caribbean origin. The authors considered families with at least three affected members who had curves equal to or greater than 10°, with rotation. The probands had curves that required orthopedic treatment, varying 20 and 55°. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with penetrance estimated at 80% was verified. The authors reported two chromosome regions potentially linked to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on chromosomes 9p34 and 17q25."
