0,Anakinra as a diagnostic challenge and treatment option for systemic autoinflammatory disorders of undefined genetic cause,Diverse monogenic autoinflammatory diseases share responsiveness to interleukin (IL)-1 blockade. This study explored the utility of anakinra (an IL-1 receptor antagonist) as a treatment option for clinically heterogeneous systemic inflammatory disease with autoinflammatory presentations where a genetic cause was not defined.,"A total of ten adult cases with ongoing inflammatory episodes, where alternative diagnoses, including malignancy and infection, were evaluated. Genetic screening was also performed to exclude known genetic causes of autoinflammatory disorders (e.g. cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), etc.)",All patients had presentations that were atypical of recognised autoinflammatory disorders and all were negative on genetic screening. Eight of ten cases showed rapid responsiveness to anakinra with the ability to subsequently taper alternative immunosuppression. Good responses to anakinra were maintained with inadvertent drug discontinuation being linked to disease flares.,"The spectrum of poorly defined clinical and genetic autoinflammatory disorders that show responsiveness to anakinra is considerable. In fact, responsiveness to anakinra appears to be useful in diagnosis given the characteristically rapid onset of efficacy and symptomatic improvement."
1,Understanding human evolutionary history: a meeting report of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences symposium of modern human genetic variation,"Despite decades of research, the catalog of human variation remains incomplete because of the limited number of worldwide populations that have been studied, inability to obtain genome-scale sequencing data in large numbers of individuals, and difficulty in comprehensively accessing complex types of variation, such as copy number variants (CNVs). A better understanding of the full spectrum of human genomic diversity is critical for delineating our evolutionary past and the heritable basis of phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. For example, Stephan Schuster (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA) presented whole-genome sequence data from several individuals of South African ancestry, and over one million novel variants were discovered. In light of the large number of (primarily non-African) individuals that have been sequenced to date, these data are striking and clearly demonstrate that a considerable number of variants have yet to be discovered, particularly in traditionally underrepresented populations.Lars Feuk (Uppsala University, Sweden) showed that changes in DNA sequence do not provide a complete portrait of human genetic diversity, and differences in DNA content (broadly defined as CNVs and inversions) among genomes is a significant source of genetic variation. By careful analysis of the breakpoints for many structural variants, general insights into the mechanistic basis of such polymorphisms were obtained. For example, Feuk demonstrated that replication based mechanisms could explain most small structural variants, whereas non-allelic homologous recombination disproportionately contributed to CNVs > 10 kb and inversion polymorphisms. The application of next-generation sequencing technology to large and globally diverse population samples is poised to provide increasingly accurate and complete collections of extant patterns of genomic variation.","The primary forces shaping patterns of DNA sequence variation are natural selection and genetic drift (that is, the stochastic change of allele and haplotype frequencies) mediated by demographic history. Thus, a considerable amount of work has focused on identifying targets of selection and estimating demographic parameters of human history, such as levels of population structure and the times and magnitudes of changes in population size. To this end, a number of talks focused on recent insights into how selection and demography have influenced human history. For instance, Sohini Ramachandran (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA) described her work on a serial founder effect model, which generates testable predictions about patterns of diversity among populations that have dispersed over long distances. Ramachandran demonstrated that a serial founder effect model of modern humans that originated in Africa explains many features of human genetic variation in both geographically diverse populations and in the peopling of the Americas. Moreover, Noah Rosenberg (Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA) showed the serial founder effect model could also account for patterns of homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium observed in worldwide populations. Rosenberg also presented results on detailed analyses of imputation, a major finding of which was that imputation accuracy increases when appropriate reference samples for a given population are used. These results are of considerable practical importance, and reinforce the message from Schuster that a better sampling of human diversity is critically needed.In another talk focused on demography, Mattias Jakobsson (Uppsala University, Sweden) presented novel data on the impact of the agricultural revolution on the genetics of contemporary European populations. Specifically, Jakobsson and colleagues obtained nearly 250 Mb of sequence from three 5,000-year-old remains of Neolithic hunter-gatherers and one Neolithic farmer excavated in Scandinavia. Analysis of these sequences in the context of the present day European gene pool suggests that the spread of agriculture involved the northward migrations of farmers. Thus, these data provide the most direct and compelling support for the demic diffusion model of agriculture (as opposed to cultural diffusion) described to date.In addition to demography, a major focus of human population genetics studies over the past decade has been identifying regions of the genome that have been substrates of adaptive evolution. Several Symposium talks presented interesting examples of selection acting in humans. For example, Rasmus Nielsen (University of California Berkeley, USA) discussed his group's recent efforts in developing and applying new statistical tools for analyzing next-generation sequencing technology. Nielsen presented a maximum likelihood method for accurately reconstructing the site frequency spectrum from low-coverage data, a prerequisite for many downstream population genetics analyses. He also presented data on the application of these tools to exome data from individuals of Han Chinese and Tibetan ancestry, and the subsequent identification of the EPAS1 gene as a target of recent and strong selection in Tibetans which has played a major role in high-altitude adaptation.Moreover, Michael Hammer (University of Arizona, Tucson, USA) presented data on levels of variation present on the X chromosome and autosomes to test hypotheses on the role that sexual selection has played in influencing patterns of human genomic diversity. Hammer showed that the expected ratio of X to autosomal variation was significantly different from the expected ratio of 0.75, and that the direction and magnitude of this ratio was strongly influenced by whether sequences analyzed were close to or far from genes. These results are difficult to reconcile by demography alone, and suggest that a complicated set of evolutionary forces, including selection, has influenced the ratio of X chromosome to autosomal diversity.","A particularly exciting series of talks focused on the genomes of extinct archaic human ancestors and current estimates on the amount of gene flow between archaic species and modern humans. Svante Pääbo (Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, Germany) summarized his group's work on obtaining whole-genome sequence data from Neandertals and Denisovans fossils. Pääbo estimates that approximately 2.5% of non-African genomes are derived from Neandertals and 5.8% of the genomes of individuals from Papua New Guinea and other regions of Melanesia are derived from Denisovans. These data suggest what Pääbo called a ""leaky replacement"" model of human origins in which modest amounts of gene flow occurred between anatomically modern humans and archaic ancestors, before these species were replaced.Similarly, Jeff Wall (University of California San Francisco, USA) described a novel method for inferring archaic admixture, which he applied to publicly available whole-genome sequence data generated by Complete Genomics. Provocatively, he finds higher rates of introgression in Asians compared to Europeans. An advantage of Wall's method is that it does not require an archaic genome to infer introgression, and thus he was able to also test the hypothesis that contemporary African genomes have signatures of gene flow with archaic human ancestors. Strikingly, Wall indeed did find evidence of archaic admixture in African genomes, suggesting that modest amounts of gene flow were widespread throughout time and space during the evolution of anatomically modern humans.","In addition to talks focused on relatively ancient events, such as archaic admixture, two talks also addressed more recent aspects of human evolutionary history. Paradoxically, whereas a relatively small number of individuals can be used to infer older evolutionary events, accurate reconstruction of very recent demography requires much larger sample sizes. To this end, Joshua Akey (University of Washington, Seattle, USA) described patterns of protein-coding variation in 2,440 European and African-American exomes. Akey showed that the vast majority of protein-coding variation was exceptionally rare, novel and the result of recent accelerated population expansions. Importantly, the dramatic population expansions observed in the exome data were not detectable in smaller sample sizes, highlighting the utility of very large samples for illuminating recent evolutionary history.In a similar vein, Mark Jobling (University of Leicester, UK) discussed the recent evolutionary history of Phoenicians, Roma, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings in Europe focusing on patterns of gene flow and population expansions. Jobling also discussed current challenges in interpreting patterns of human genetic variation, and emphasized the need for synergistic interactions between different fields, such as history, archaeology and linguistics in order to understand human history."
2,Genetic markers in clinical subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common children rheumatic disease. This term includes different clinical subtypes that do not have the same presentation, prognosis and therapeutic response. Therefore some studies review this classification, and proposed other criteria as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), age of beginning or uveitis. Our objective was to look for an association between different clinical subtypes of JIA and some single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which have already been identify in JIA and other auto-immune diseases.","We performed a retrospective, monocentric study. Children were classified according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification. Polyarticular and systemic forms, and patients who required biologics were defined as severe. DNA from patients was extracted from a blood sample, and was placed on a FTA elute card. Four SNP in four genes were analysed (TGF-B codon 25 rs1800471, TRAF-1 C5 rs10818488, STAT 4 rs7574865, et PTPN22 rs2476601). A Fisher test was performed to analyze the association between those SNP and the different clinical sub types of JIA.","101 children with JIA were included. Oligoarticular form was the most frequent (68 patients, mean age 4.87 years old (YO)). Polyarticular (FR + and FR -) and enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) forms were less frequent (mean age 5.16 and 11 YO respectively). 18 children developed an uveitis, especially when AAN are positive (14 associated with oligoarticular form). 38 were treated with TNF antagonist (29.4% of oligoarticular, 42.1% of polyarticular and 100% of systemic forms). Genotype CC of PTPN22 seems to be more frequent in oligoarticular form, but this association is not significant (p=0.12). However, in ANA-positive patients, this association is significant with oligoarticular form, compared to polyarticular JIA (p<0.05). In oligoarticular forms, genotype AA of TRAF1C5 seems to be associated with the risk of uveitis, but this association is not significant. We did not find association between those SNP and other clinical subtype, disease severity or age of beginning.","We could not find a significant association between those genetic markers and the different clinical subtype of JIA, but a trend for an association between oligoarticular form and genotype CC of this SNP of PTPN22. We are going to try to confirm this association including more children in this study."
3,Clinical and genetic aspects of testicular germ cell tumours,"Testicular tumours can be divided into germ cell tumours, stromal tumours and other tumours (e.g. malignant lymphomas). Tumours of paratesticular structures form a separate group. This review focuses solely on the testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) seminoma and non-seminoma. TGCT are rare, but they are the most frequently occurring tumour in men aged between 15 and 40 years. In the Netherlands, 536 men were diagnosed with TGCT in 2003, while in 2004, 30 men died of this malignancy. Although the incidence of TGCT has increased sharply in recent years, survival of patients with TGCT has improved enormously. Five-year survival in the nineteen seventies was about 65% compared to more than 90% at present [1]. Improved survival can chiefly be attributed to the cisplatin-based polychemotherapy that was introduced in the nineteen eighties to treat patients with metastasized TGCT. In addition, new strategies have been developed in the surgical approach to metastasized/non-metastasized TGCT and alterations have been made to the radiotherapy technique and radiation dose for seminoma [2, 3]. The progress in diagnosis, treatment and the subsequent treatment outcomes in patients with TGCT are the ultimate result of multidisciplinary teamwork. At the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), this multidisciplinary approach was started at the end of the nineteen seventies to provide every patient with tailored treatment. These accomplishments in the treatment of TGCT have led to the present goal of further optimising the treatment for TGCT, in which the research and treatment chiefly concentrate on reducing the toxic side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In patients with prognostically favourable factors (Table 1) [4], the number of courses of chemotherapy can be reduced, whereas in patients with prognostically unfavourable factors, more intensive chemotherapy is necessary to improve the chances of survival. Nowadays the majority of TGCT patients can be cured by multidisciplinary treatment. Therefore, the number of TGCT survivors will continue to increase. In principle, these TGCT survivors will be exposed to the long-term consequences of chemotherapy-related toxicity (side-effects) or the long-term side-effects of radiotherapy. TGCT survivors are mostly young men who can be expected to have a long life ahead of them. This has meant that over the past few years, scientific research has centred on studying the long-term effects of treatment [5–8] and the quality of life of these TGCT survivors [9]. All this research has the ultimate aim of achieving further improvement in the treatment and follow-up of TGCT patients.Table 1 IGCCCG prognostic classification for germ cell cancer [4]Full size table","Carcinoma in situ (CIS) (or intratubular germ cell neoplasia) is the precursor of TGCT and is found in nearly all TGCT together with an invasive component. CIS cells originate from primordial germ cells that ""escaped"" normal differentiation in utero. It is assumed that over the course of time, CIS ""develops"" into an invasive TGCT, but the precise transformation of premalignant CIS into a TGCT is not yet clear. It is suggested that the default pathway follows the development of CIS into seminoma and that non-seminoma requires activation of pluripotency (reprogramming) of a CIS or seminoma cell [10, 11]. A theoretical model of TGCT development as part of testicular dysgenesis, taking into account a range of reported TGCT risk factors, has been developed by Skaekebaek et al. [12] and is referred to as the testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) (Figure 1). In recent years several studies have looked into chromosomal abnormalities and more recently at gene mutations and gene activity in TGCT to unravel the molecular pathways underlying these tumours. A detailed overview of (non-inherited) genomic aberrations in TGCT was recently published by von Eyben [13]. Aneuploidy has been found in nearly all cases and triploidy is a common finding. Seminomas have a mean hypertriploid DNA index and non-seminomas have a mean hypotriploid DNA index (due to loss of chromosomal material during cancer progression) [11]. When looking at individual chromosomal regions, an isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12, i(12p), (resulting in a duplication of the short arm of chromosome 12) is found in about 80% of TGCT. The remainder have excess 12p genetic material in derivative chromosomes [14]. The exact relation between these changes and TGCT is unclear but the absence of amplification of a section of 12p in intratubular germ cell neoplasia suggests that this amplification may be related to progression of the disease rather than initiation [15]. A recent gene expression profile study on TGCT material identified differentiated expressed genes on 12p. Seventy-three genes on 12p were significantly overexpressed, indicating that the p arm of chromosome 12 may play an important role in TGCT tumorigenesis [16]. In addition to the genes located on 12p, a growing list of genes is implicated in the various stages of TGCT development. In particular, TGCT has been shown to be associated with a characteristic series of abnormalities in the retinoblastoma pathway including upregulation of cyclin D2 and p27 and downregulation of RB1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of p16, p18, p19 and p21 [13]. A gain of activity of the KIT gene, a member of the tyrosine kinase family, appears to play a role in the progression of CIS towards seminomas [17]. Recently, the scope of genetic study of TGCT has been extended to include the role of naturally occurring micro RNAs (miRNAs). Indeed, some of these miRNAs (miRNA-372 and 373) were shown to allow tumorigenic growth. As they have also been observed to be expressed in human seminomas and non- seminomas, but not in normal testicular tissue, it has been suggested that these miRNAs may represent a new class of oncogenes involved in TGCT [18].Figure 1The testicular dysgenesis syndrome.Full size image","TGCT can be divided into two important histological subtypes: seminoma and non-seminoma. Pure seminoma occurs in about 50% of cases and often (in 20%) contains trophoblastic giant cells that can produce beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG). Non-seminoma chiefly comprises two or more cell types, for example embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma (also contains trophoblastic giant cells), yolk sac tumour, and teratoma, whether or not in combination with seminoma. Embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumour elements are associated with the production of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Clinically, there are three important tumour markers in the diagnosis and follow-up of TGCT: β-HCG, a-fetoprotein (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [2].","Patients who present with a painless swelling of the testicle and increased levels of AFP, β-HCG and/or LDH have a TGCT until proven otherwise. Clinical presentation varies widely. TGCT can also show extra-testicular clinical manifestation (without any testicular complaints). Retroperitoneal lymph node metastases can cause (lower) back pain, while haemoptysis can be the result of pulmonary metastases. Ultrasound examination of the testicle is useful to establish possible testicular abnormalities. Radical inguinal orchidectomy with high ligation of the spermatic cord, blood vessels and lymph vessels is the surgical treatment for patients who are suspected of having a TGCT. Originally, the testicles descend via the retroperitoneal route and inguinal canal into the scrotum. This often results in regional metastases from a TGCT that first arise in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A right-sided TGCT tends to metastasize to the interaortocaval lymph nodes, whereas a left-sided TGCT tends to metastasize to the para-aortic lymph nodes. At a higher, supradiaphragmatic level, metastases can spread via the thoracic duct and result in mediastinal or supraclavicular metastases. Haematogenically, TGCT chiefly metastasize to the lungs, later to the liver, the skeleton and the cerebrum [3, 19].StagingWhen a patient has been diagnosed with a TGCT, the malignancy must be staged. This can be done by means of tumour markers (AFP and β-HCG, LDH) and spiral CT (computed tomography) scanning of the lungs, the retroperitoneum and pelvis. On indication (anamnestic complaints of the cerebrum and/or sharply elevated β-HCG), CT scanning of the cerebrum is conducted. The roles and/or additional value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are currently under investigation [20]. At the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (UMCG), patients with TGCT are staged according to the Royal Marsden classification (Table 2). Patients with stage I have no radiological or biochemical evidence of metastases. Patients with stages II to IV have metastasized disease. These patients are subsequently classified according to the prognostic factors formulated by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) (Table 1) and a treatment plan is drawn up on the basis of the subgroup classification (good/intermediate/poor) [4].Table 2 Royal Marsden staging classification of testicular germ cell tumoursFull size tableTreatmentStage I disease (= non-metastasized disease)About half of the patients with a non-seminoma present with stage I disease. Presently, the treatment comprises radical orchidectomy with high ligation of the spermatic cord, blood vessels and lymph vessels, followed by regular outpatient visits (wait-and-see policy) or modified unilateral nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The UMCG has been applying the wait-and-see policy to patients with stage I disease since 1982 [21]. In the meantime, world-wide consensus has been reached about the treatment for stage I non-seminoma patients in the low-risk group (i.e. histological examination does not show any vascular invasion of the tumour). These patients have a 15% risk of TGCT relapse; thus the wait-and-see policy is justified and comprises regular outpatient visits for 5 years after orchidectomy with physical examination, tumour marker analysis and frequent radiological investigation.There is a great deal of discussion about the current treatment policy for patients with stage I non-seminoma in the high-risk group (i.e. histopathological investigation shows vascular invasion). Unilateral nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) or adjuvant chemotherapy leads to a considerable reduction in the risk of relapse of about 5%. However, the disadvantages of RPLND (loss of ejaculatory function) or chemotherapy (toxicity) must be taken into consideration. The UMCG still applies the wait-and-see policy to these high-risk patients. In the UK and many other European countries, the preferred pproach for high-risk patients is often to administer two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas in the USA it is the trend to perform nerve-sparing unilateral RPLND [2, 3]. Which treatment policy is the best for these so-called 'high-risk' patients is unknown.About 75% of patients with seminoma have stage I disease. The standard treatment after orchidectomy is radiotherapy of the retroperitoneal para-aortic lymph nodes with a total dose of 20 Gy. In this way the relapse rate is reduced to 1-3% [2]. The advantage of para-aortic radiotherapy (while excluding the ipsilateral lymph nodes) is less gastrointestinal and gonadal toxicity. As an alternative to radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy can be administered. The latter approach results in the same relapse rates [22]. A wait-and-see policy alone would lead to relapse rates of 15 to 20% and is less suitable, because there are no sensitive tumour markers for seminoma and the patient would therefore have to undergo frequent radiological investigation [2, 3].Metastasized diseasePatients with stage IIa and IIb seminoma receive radiotherapy with a total dose of 30 and 36 Gy, respectively. In contrast to stage I seminoma, the ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes are also included in the treatment volume (dog-leg field) in patients with stage II seminoma. This approach achieves 6-year relapse-free survival of 95% in stage IIa patients and 89% in stage IIb patients. Alternative treatments to radiotherapy can be considered in stage IIb patients, for example 3 courses of BEP (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) or 4 courses of EP (etoposide and cisplatin) [2, 3].Treatment for patients with stage IIc-IV metastasized seminoma and with stage II-IV metastasized non-seminoma comprises chemotherapy in accordance with the prognostic factor classification. In the good prognosis group, patients with non-seminoma/seminoma receive chemotherapy in the form of 3 courses of BEP or 4 courses of EP. Patients in the intermediate and poor prognosis groups are treated with 4 courses of BEP [2, 23, 24].Surgery after chemotherapyAfter completion of chemotherapy, patients with a metastasized tumour (TGCT) at the UMCG undergo restaging with the aid of serum tumour marker analyses (as described above) and spiral CT scanning of the lungs and retroperitoneum. When radiological investigation shows residual disease after completion of chemotherapy in patients with seminoma, surgical resection is not performed, but instead the abnormality is followed radiologically. Generally, a new indication will arise for chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which if necessary is combined with surgical resection of the residual tumour. Presently, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be applied to help identify viable cancer [25].After patients with non-seminomatous TGCT have completed chemotherapy, there is no indication for surgical resection when they do not show any residual disease, or the residual abnormality is smaller than 1 cm, the tumour markers have normalised and mature teratoma is absent from the primary tumour. Follow-up is then conducted on the basis of tumour markers. However, when residual (abdominal/pulmonary) disease is identified, surgical resection must be performed on the residual retroperitoneal tumour mass (RRRTM), or local resection in the case of residual pulmonary tumour tissue. When residual tumour persists after completion of chemotherapy and the tumour markers remain high, an individual treatment plan must be drawn up: salvage chemotherapy or salvage surgery.In patients with non-seminomatous TGCT, it is not possible to predict the histology of the residual tumour. After surgical resection, histological examination shows that the mass consists of necrosis in 45% of cases, mature teratoma in 40%, viable tumour tissue in 10% and non-germ cell malignancies in the remaining 5% [26].When the resected residual tumour only contains necrosis or mature teratoma, no further treatment is necessary and the patient has an excellent prognosis. However, when viable tumour tissue is present, the prognosis is less favourable and depending on factors such as the initial prognostic classification (Table 1), the volume (percentage) of residual viable cancer and the completeness of the resection, it may be necessary to administer adjuvant salvage chemotherapy [27].The clinical significance of mature teratoma in the residual tumour is not yet completely clear and it is impossible to predict the course that can be expected from mature teratoma left in situ. In the literature, ""growing teratoma"" is a well-known phenomenon and it can lead to (very) late tumour recurrence. In addition, there is a risk that mature teratoma will de-differentiate into a non-germ cell malignancy (e.g. sarcoma). In such cases, the prognosis of the patient is far less favourable. Radical surgery is the only curative treatment option for these non-germ cell tumours.When the primary TGCT contains elements of mature teratoma, there is a greater chance that the residual tumour will also contain teratomatous elements. Therefore, at the UMCG, all patients with elements of teratoma in the primary tumour undergo laparotomy and partial retroperitoneal dissection at the ""original"" tumour site after chemotherapy, even when there are no radiological signs of residual disease [26]."
4,The complex genetic basis of simple behavior,"Neuropsychiatric geneticists are now focusing considerable attention on the investigation of quantitative human behavioral traits, postulating that such phenotypes could be more straightforward to genetically map than neuropsychiatric disorders. Such syndromes are among the most complex of human traits, a fact that may explain why efforts to elucidate their etiology have been singularly unsuccessful. Although quantitative phenotypes may be simpler than clinically heterogeneous diseases, there is still little evidence that human behavioral quantitative trait loci (QTL) will be easy to identify. For this reason there is a tremendous appeal in using the powerful tools available for genetic investigation of simple model organisms; genes implicated in behavioral variation in flies or worms can then be targeted for various forms of analysis in mammals, including humans. This strategy depends on the identification of suitable measures of behavior in simple systems. Circadian rhythms are a classic example. Investigations of clock mutants in Drosophila led to the discovery of the first circadian rhythm gene, period, and ultimately to cellular pathways underlying circadian behavior [1]; this line of investigation was subsequently successfully extended in rodents as well as humans [2].Aggressive behavior is another complex behavioral trait that can be efficiently modeled in Drosophila [3, 4]. Yet, as recently reported by Edwards et al. [5], aggressive behavior in flies results from the action of numerous genes, reflects extensive pleiotropy, and is significantly influenced by molecular processes outside the nervous system. Perhaps circadian rhythm phenotypes will prove more an exception than the rule; when it comes to behavior, a simple system does not guarantee simple genetics.","Given the observation that aggressive behavior in flies has such an apparently complex genetic basis, it is worth reviewing the motivations for using such a behavioral genetic model. In humans it is a given that most behavioral traits involve interactions between numerous genetic loci in the context of multiple, mostly unquantified environmental influences. No strategies implemented so far have been sufficiently powerful to overcome the challenge represented by this degree of complexity, and the systematic genome-wide mapping of human behavioral QTL is, therefore, still a nascent endeavor. This fact alone could account for interest in investigation of behavioral pheno types in virtually all widely used animal genetic models, including Drosophila. Given the functional analogies of tissues, organs and organ systems as well as the considerable conservation of neurobehavioral traits and of a high proportion of gene counterparts between human and fly [6], identification of Drosophila behavioral QTL is useful for informing studies in other organisms, including humans [7]. Elucidation of the molecular basis of a specific trait such as aggressive behaviour in Drosophila could answer several questions of generalized importance: which genes of unknown function, gene functions and pathways may contribute to the trait? How many genes are implicated in a single complex behavior? What is their effect on the trait in terms of magnitude and specificity?The particular strength of the Drosophila model for behavioral investigation is its suitability for various experi mental genetic approaches. It is ideal for artificial selection for a target trait (such as aggressive behavior) and for genetic modification of candidate genes. In addition, it offers diverse complex behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes that can be efficiently quantified to study the putative pleiotropy of candidate genes. For example, a quantitative aggression phenotype has been assayed by scoring aggressive encounters among male files that were exposed to a food droplet after 90 minutes of food depri vation [4, 5]. In Drosophila it is also particularly straight forward to control variations in environmental influences that might influence behaviors, a factor that adds substantially to the power to identify genes that influence quanti tative traits, especially genes contributing a small amount of the trait variance.","As Drosophila has a short generation time and controlled mating is easy, it is possible to perform artificial selection by repeatedly selecting individuals that show extreme scores for behavioral measures. Resulting divergent lines with high or low aggressive behavior show significant differ ences in gene expression for as much as 10% of the fly genome [4]. It is likely that genetic variants directly regulate only a relatively small fraction of the genes contributing to the transcriptional response to selection for aggres sive behavior; rather, most of these genes are co-regulated in response to causal genes [8]. Nevertheless, the observation that a substantial fraction of the Drosophila genome may be related to aggressive behavior raises interest in determining whether specific genes are directly involved in the trait, in quantifying the magnitude of their effect, and in evaluating whether these genes also contribute to other traits.The effect of a candidate gene on a complex trait in an animal model can be directly established by functional analysis – for example, by inducing mutation in a candidate gene and then quantifying relevant phenotypes. Unlike QTL mapping, which establishes relations between a phenotype and specific underlying causative genetic variants, mutational analysis discovers the function of candidate genes and elucidates the molecular mechanisms for such functions. The advantage of mutational analysis is that it tests a role of a candidate gene on a defined isogenic background, facilitating the detection of subtle mutational effects. For mutational analysis Edwards et al. [5] used P-element insertional mutant fly lines to investigate the effects of a large series of novel candidate genes that had not been previously implicated in aggressive behavior. These genes were selected solely on the basis of gene expression measures obtained after artificial selection for this trait [4] or their known involvement in other complex behavioral traits. Functional evidence supported a role in aggressive behavior of a large fraction (almost 40%) of these novel candidate genes, but mutations in them exert only small or moderate effects on aggression level [5].This observation supports the suggestion that the genetic architecture of complex behavior may be remarkably similar in organisms as neurobiologically simple as Drosophila and as complex as humans [9]. There is now a consensus that human neurobehavioral diseases mainly reflect the effects of large numbers of genetic variants of relatively small effect and, therefore, that genetic dissection of such traits will require investigation of samples of considerable size. The findings of Edwards et al. [5] imply that a similar expectation may hold for QTL mapping of aggressive behaviors in humans. Identifying the functional importance of so many variants will obviously be more straightforward in flies than in humans, and progress in dissecting human traits may depend on the degree to which they reflect molecular mechanisms similar to those in their Drosophila counterparts.","One of the most interesting findings to emerge from the investigation of aggression in Drosophila concerns the size and localization of mutation-induced expression changes. Edwards et al. [5] found that relatively small transcript-level alterations (twofold or less) noticeably affect behavior. Their observation suggests that, in considering intermediate phenotypes for behavioral traits, it would be unwise to ignore transcripts showing a low magnitude of expression alterations. Their results also remind us that an arbitrary division between the brain and the remainder of the body may be unhelpful in efforts to understand complex behavior. Investigations of the spatial expression pattern of wild-type and mutant genes, using decapitated flies, indicated that significant differences between wild-type and mutated genes occurred for all tested genes; however, for the majority of such genes significant differences were detected in the bodies but were not observed in the heads [5]. Accordingly, investigations of human behavioral traits should probably pay greater attention than is typically the case at present to gene expression patterns in peripheral tissues and more vigorously evaluate other types of molecular phenotypes (such as endocrine markers) as intermediate phenotypes. Indeed, the observations in the fly are consistent with, for example, the confirmed role of hormonal regulation in the development and function of the nervous system as well as in levels and types of aggressive behavior in various species, including non-human primates and humans.A single gene may generate pleiotropy by contributing to a variety of traits. There is existing – although not abundant – evidence that a single gene or even a single genetic variant related to neuropsychiatric diseases may contribute to diverse cognitive and neuroanatomical phenotypes. For example, PER3 is implicated in a rare human circadian rhythm disorder called delayed sleep phase syndrome, but it is also associated with several other circadian phenotypes and with cognitive measures, such as performance tasks assessed during sleep deprivation and brain responses to a working memory task assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging [2]. A striking observation reported by Edwards et al. [5] is that, in flies, a very large fraction of mutations introduced in genes related to aggressive behavior produce extremely pleiotropic effects, affecting various complex traits. Among the most interesting of these traits are quantitative changes in brain morphology observed in mutants' mushroom bodies. These structures were previously implicated in aggressive behavior in Drosophila and show many parallels to an analogous mammalian brain structure, the hippocampus, which also has an important role in behavior [10]. The observation of pleiotropy of particular genes with respect to related traits (such as aggressive behavior and neuroanatomical phenotypes) may provide an important form of corroboration of the role of a given gene in contributing to complex behavioral traits.Demonstrations of the importance of pleiotropy in the genetic regulation of behavioral variation also provide support for approaches using human genetic mapping that attempt to take advantage of pleiotropy by identifying various intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) that link genes and disease. An endophenotype-centered approach has two major potential advantages over genetic mapping of disease phenotypes themselves. First, it is hypothesized that endophenotypes are more directly associated with genetic variation than is disease. Second, unlike disease, endophenotypes can be investigated as quantitative traits and are, therefore, more readily studied in animal models.The findings of Edwards et al. [5] indicating novel candidate genes and cellular processes for aggressive behavior in the fly model provide useful information about the biology of behavioral traits and also suggest new loci and pathways for studies in other organisms, including humans. The increasing sense that a universal feature of complex behavior may be the contribution of numerous genetic variants of small effect may influence experimental design in human genetic studies of behavioral traits. Furthermore, although it is often assumed that the genetic complexity of the behavioral traits mostly reflects the complexity of the central nervous system, Edwards et al. [5] demonstrated the importance of also considering genes that act mainly in the periphery. Finally, the extensive pleiotropy of behaviorally important genes observed in the fly model may suggest that their human orthologs exert similarly widespread phenotypic effects. These conclusions are not comforting for those attempting to dissect human behaviors genetically, but they offer a reminder that sustained investigation of simple model systems is critically important to these efforts."
5,The IgA nephropathy Biobank. An important starting point for the genetic dissection of a complex trait,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) or Berger's disease is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide in patients undergoing renal biopsy. Diagnosis is based on the occurrence of mesangial deposits of IgA in the glomeruli in the presence of recurrent episodes of intra-infectious macroscopic hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria. The frequency of this disease is renal biopsy policy-dependent [1]. In some countries, the majority of patients with recurrent macroscopic hematuria undergo renal biopsy only in the presence of proteinuria or mild renal insufficiency. In Eastern countries, however, many young subjects with persistent microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria often receive renal biopsy. This is not the policy in most Western countries, in addition often asymptomatic subjects with persistent urinary abnormalities (microhematuria and/or proteinuria) decline renal biopsy. This large variability in symptoms induces different approaches in performing renal biopsy. Nevertheless, renal biopsy practice is not the sole cause of the different disease worldwide prevalence. Striking ethnic variation in prevalence [2–6] along with familial clustering [7–9] are suggestive of an important role of the genetic component in the pathogenesis of the disease. IgAN may occur in a sporadic or a familial form according to the clinical evidence that one or more subjects belonging to the same family are affected by biopsy-proven IgAN [10–12]. Moreover, sub-clinical renal abnormalities are often evidenced among relatives of IgAN patients [9, 11, 13].Genetic analysis of large pedigrees of IgAN families is considered the most promising approach to identify IgAN susceptibility genes. The genome wide scanning in 30 large extended IgAN multiplex families (24 from Italy and 6 from United States) was performed by Gharavi et al [14]. This study identified the locus, called IGAN1, located on chromosome 6q22–23 in linkage with IgAN. It yielded a significant peak Lod-score of 5.6, with 60% of families linked, assuming an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance. This mode of inheritance of familial IgAN is more consistent with the involvement of a single gene with a large effect located in IGAN1. Nevertheless, multifactorial determination, with the interplay of many genes, each conferring a small effect cannot be excluded. The knowledge gained from the study of Mendelian diseases has shown that genetic dissection of a complex trait is more powerful when combined linkage-based, association-based, and sequence-based approaches are performed [15]. Association-based studies are possible when a large sample size of adequately matched IgAN patients and healthy subjects is collected. Prior insight into the pathogenesis of the disease allows to establish the candidate genes to be studied according to their known or suspected function. Over the past decade, a shift has occurred away from case-control association studies, towards family-based designs in which extended pedigrees, relative-pairs and parents-child trios are used to test for association. For this purpose, different powerful and sensitive methods of analysis have been developed, most of which are based on the trasmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) [16].Considering the possibility of identifying IgAN susceptibility genes a group of European scientists, specialists in this disease, constituted an IgAN Consortium and organized a Biobank project recruiting biological samples and clinical data from IgAN patients and relatives. This report describes the creation of the first Biobank with a readily accessible database of the most common worldwide glomerulonephritis, a rare disease which requires a multi-centre project organization.","The IgAN Consortium was based on the constitution of a collaborative study group including expert nephrologists from Italy (FPS, FS, GMF), Germany (JF) and Greece (EA), geneticists from Italy (AA, LB, GC, GMG) and Germany (KZ). The European project No. QLG1-2000-00464 was funded by the 5th Framework Programme 1998–2002. Additional funds were obtained in Italy from MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, Universita' e Ricerca PRIN 2001-067748; L.488/92 Cluster 03; FIRB 2001-RBNE013JYN).The main aim of the project was to constitute a genomic DNA bank of well characterized IgAN patients and their relatives from three different European countries (Germany, Greece and Italy) to be used for genetic studies. The following objectives were reached:1. a) Definition of a common protocol for the diagnosis of familial, suspected and sporadic IgAN. IgAN was diagnosed on the basis of either recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria concomitant with upper respiratory tract and other infections or permanent microscopic hematuria with/out proteinuria. Mesangial glomerular IgA deposits in the renal biopsy and absence of systemic or hepatic diseases confirmed the diagnosis. Relatives of at least three generations received urinalysis. All relatives with persistent microscopic hematuria received an Addis count under contrast phase microscopy (glomerular hematuria was confirmed at least three times) and renal ultrasound. Relatives with suspected IgAN were informed and received renal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. All subjects were categorized as: (I) affected subjects with biopsy-proven disease; (II) subjects probably affected by IgAN when persistent microscopic hematuria without biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis, or chronic renal insufficiency or ESRD treated with hemo or peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation after biopsy-proven IgAN or unknown glomerulonephritis, or death caused by chronic uremia, occurred; (III) non-affected subjects in the absence of urinary abnormalities; (IV) subjects with unknown status, who refused participation or in the absence of clinical information and laboratory findings. Familial IgAN was diagnosed when at least 2 family members had biopsy-proven IgAN. Suspected IgAN families were considered those in which one subject was a biopsy-proven IgAN patient and others were probably affected, were awaiting or refused renal biopsy, or had urinary abnormalities that did not justify its execution. They were checked systematically once a year. Sporadic IgAN was diagnosed when the disease occurred only in the patient and relatives were negative by urinalysis. b) Layout of a booklet containing information, letter of informed consent and instructions for the collection of blood samples. c) Definition of a data sheet for the collection of personal data, clinical and laboratory findings.2. Constitution of the Biobank. Blood samples from all the participants after informed consent (disclosing information about the research objectives, benefits and risks) were obtained. Thirty ml of peripheral blood was drawn from each subject aged more than 15 years and 15 ml from each younger subject. Plasma and serum samples were stored at -80°C in order to be used for the biochemical (inflammatory cytokines and chemokines) and immunological parameter measurements (complement components, IgA serum level, IgA galactosylation) as required. EDTA tubes were used to collect blood samples for DNA isolation. The EDTA anticoagulated blood sample from each subject was divided into three aliquots, two of which were processed for DNA extraction, in a separate manner, using commercial kits. The first DNA sample was stored in ethanol 75% at 4°C, in the form of a pellet. The second one was suspended in deionised nuclease free water and subdivided into two aliquots ready to use. They were independently stored at 4°C and at -20°C. Storage at 4°C prevents degradation due to the mechanical stress of freezing and thawing and storage at -20°C inhibits possible DNase activity. This method was adopted to guarantee an adequate quality DNA sample and long term storage. Moreover, the last aliquot of whole blood was stored at -20°C in order to isolate a DNA sample whenever needed. DNA was isolated in the Bari, Trieste, Genova and Aachen laboratories. F.P.S., F.S., A.A., J.F., E.A. oversaw the accuracy of the DNA sample collection. All the IgAN patients and relatives, from whom DNA samples were collected, were listed in the database and were available to the IgAN Consortium partners and to the investigators proposing collaborative studies. The protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committees. The documents regarding each local Ethical Committee who have given approval for the study, in their original language, have been disclosed as a window in the IgAN Consortium website [17], purposely constructed for this study.3. Construction of a website to share scientific information between partners and to divulge obtained data to the community. The IgAN Consortium website was designed and realized by Apulia Biotech (Valenzano, Bari, Italy) and is managed by Altanet SRL (Altamura, Bari, Italy) internet provider. The website includes three sections: (a) Information, (b) Registry and (c) News (fig. 1) all readily accessible for public vision. Section (a) contains guidelines for the collection of blood samples, information about the disease and the informed consent form to be compiled. Section (b) encloses the electronic database for the collection of all personal and clinical data of each enrolled subject. The IgAN Consortium partners are given personal passwords to insert and modify information included in the database. This section is also provided with a search page (clinical finding search page) that gives free access to the database. Groups of IgAN patients can be selected according to their specific characteristics. The clinical history can be viewed observing the confidentiality of each subject. Important information about IgAN Consortium policy for collaborative studies are given. This section is periodically updated in all its parts. Section (c) is devoted to public dissemination of achieved data. It presently includes the report of three years of activities.

4. Construction of an electronic database, for the collection of personal data, clinical, histological and laboratory findings. The database was developed in Filemaker Pro 5.0 obtaining a powerful cross platform relational database. The website interface was realized by using Lasso by Omnipilot Software Inc as the local data markup language (LDML) that connected our HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages to the Filemaker database. 4D Webstar was used as Internet server. It encloses the list of IgAN patients and relatives enrolled, and the familial IgAN pedigrees. Pedigrees were drawn using the software Cyrillic 2.1. Each collected family and subject was univocally identified by a sequence of three numeric codes: partner unit, family and subject code. Each partner identified a staff member, responsible for the attribution of the codes. Progressive numeric codes for families and subjects were assigned according to the time of enrolment in this study. All the data collected for each enrolled subject at the onset of the disease, at the time of the renal biopsy and at the available follow up are included in the database. Serum creatinine (sCR) and daily proteinuria were obtained from IgAN patients at different times. Daily proteinuria was defined as mild (<1 g), moderate (1–3 g) and severe (>3 g). Renal function was evaluated by creatinine clearance obtained using the Cockcroft formula [18]. According to the K-DOQI guidelines [19] the stages of chronic kidney disease were classified as kidney damage with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 90 ml/min), mild (60–89 ml/min), moderate (30–59 ml/min) and severe impaired renal function (15–29 ml/min) and kidney failure (<15 ml/min or dialysis). According to the 2003 ESH/ESC hypertension guidelines [20], subjects were defined hypertensives when blood pressure was above 130/85 mmHg or when they received anti-hypertensive drugs. Three outcome measures were considered in the follow up of the IgAN patients: chronic renal insufficiency, dialysis and renal transplant. Renal biopsy specimens were scored considering the severity of glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions. According to the WHO classification 3 histological grades (G) were identified: a) G1 (mild disease); b) G2 (moderate disease); c) G3 (severe disease) [21, 22]. In the search page of the website Registry-section the biopsy-proven IgAN patients (BP-IgAN) may be selected according to these clinical and laboratory characteristics at the time of the renal biopsy or according to the main outcome measures. The result page included three important links: the ""pedigree"" field allows the visualization of the familial IgAN cases; the ""info"" field introduces the complete clinical history of each patient and the ""follow up"" field links directly to the data at different follow up times for each patient.A medical geneticist collaborating with each nephrology unit involved in the project offered genetic counselling to IgAN patients and relatives. The main purpose of the counselling is to give information on a complex genetic disease such as IgAN and to illustrate the Biobank objectives, underlining that the genetic tests will not give an immediate answer to the possibility of developing the disease or not. The clinicians explained to all patients the potential familial incidence of the disease and invited their relatives to the genetic counselling session in which a clinical screening was proposed for all relatives. In addition, they were informed on the possibility to be enrolled in this Biobank. For this purpose, the aims of the project were discussed in lay terms with respect to the risk for the involved subjects. It was clearly stated that the subjects tested would not benefit personally from the genetic studies. Financial rewards were not offered to encourage participation. Patients and relatives were informed that the DNA would be used only for the present project i.e. genetic dissection of IgAN. Moreover, a detailed description of the genetic studies to be carried out was given. Informed consent was signed after the genetic counselling.Normal subjects were recruited among healthy blood donors with negative urinalysis and no history of renal disease, diabetes, hypertension or metabolic disorders. They were matched for age, gender and ethnicity to the IgAN patient population enrolled. They were scrupulously informed about the aim of the study. They gave a written informed consent for DNA collection and for the handling of their genetic and personal data for the present project. The collection of DNA samples is still underway. The IgAN Consortium collected DNA samples from IgAN patients and relatives belonging to at least three generations, with particular attention paid to the collection of all first degree relatives. DNA samples, collected from the research units are listed in table 1. All the subjects enrolled were of Caucasian origin and belonging to different European geographic area: North and South Italy (Lombardia, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Puglia region), Greece (Thessaloniki), Germany (Nordrhein, Westfalia region). DNA samples from 72 multiplex IgAN families, 63 suspected IgAN families, 1068 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN were obtained. The number of collected relatives for each family enrolled was different. Fifty-one IgAN families have less than 10 relatives, 17 include a number of relatives ranging from 10 to 20 subjects and finally 4 IgAN families have more than 20 relatives. Forty-nine suspected IgAN families have less than 10, 13 less than 20 and 1 family has more than 20 relatives. A large sample size was obtained in the form of trios (son/daughter affected and healthy parents). A large number of healthy blood donors adequately matched for age, gender and origin to the patient populations were recruited as controls in each area.Table 1 Collection of DNA samples from IgAN patients, relatives and apparently healthy controls obtained by the IgAN Consortium.Full size table
Seventy-two IgAN families included DNA samples from 94 pairs of biopsy proven IgAN patients and a total number of 2573 pairs of relatives. Table 2 shows the distribution of pairs of relatives collected from the 72 IgAN families according to genetic relationship and disease.Table 2 Distribution of pairs of relatives in 72 IgAN families according to genetic relationship and IgAN.Full size table
A gradually increasing number of DNA samples collected during the first three years of our project (from beginning of October 2000 to the end of December 2003) is shown in figure 2. Some valuable and statistically productive genetic studies have been launched within the 5th Framework Programme 1998–2002 of the European project No. QLG1-2000-00464. Case-control and family-based association studies investigating the possible role of some Th1/Th2/Th3/TR-type, and of monocyte/macrophage cytokines gene polymorphisms and Core1 β 1,3- Galactosyltransferase (β1.3 C1GALT1) gene are presently under way. Some preliminary data are publicly available in the ""Technology Marketplace"" website [23]. Further investigations needs to strengthen the data obtained.Figure 2DNA samples collected from the beginning of the IgAN Consortium European project.Full size image
","We have described the constitution of the European IgAN Biobank which is the first DNA bank created in the world by the multi-centre collaborative project for this disease. The main aim of this project was to organize a genomic DNA bank of biopsy-proven IgAN patients and their family members belonging to three different geographic areas of Europe (Germany, Greece and Italy). The Biobank has taken care of ethical aspects since the collection and storage of personal and genetic information follow the indications of the Council of Europe, as stated in the Convention on human rights and biomedicine (Nov 19, 1996), and those of UNESCO, as reported in the Declaration on human genome (Nov 11, 1997). In addition, the handling of personal and genetic data collected follow the indications and norms existing in each participating country.The IgAN Consortium has set up a website to allow the partners to share the scientific information and for public dissemination of all the information related to the disease and new achieved data [17]. The accessible database without restriction permits to share clinical data of IgAN patients with other participating centres. A search page supports the investigators in selecting IgAN patient groups with respect to specific clinical data to perform prospective and retrospective studies.Studies that seek to identify disease genes can be divided into two categories: linkage and association studies. Linkage studies speculate on the co-segregation of marker alleles and disease of interest in multiplex families while association studies detect linkage disequilibrium between marker and disease loci using case-control and/or family-based designs. In the simplest design, genetic variant frequencies of exposure are compared to diseased cases and non diseased controls. This approach, highly effective in detecting genes of modest effect, is susceptible to ""population stratification bias"" arising from differences in the genetic background of cases and controls. The distribution of alleles in a population is related to the ethnic and social background and geographical origin of their parents. There is a great debate on the possibility of analysing isolated populations for genetic studies, which may be homogeneous such as Finnish, Icelanders, Sardinians, or heterogeneous populations such as in the case of the UK Biobank [24–28]. Researchers reason that in a population such as Iceland's (270,000 individuals), which expanded from a relatively small number of founders and that did not experience significant immigration, there should be fewer opportunities for particular markers and disease genes to have become separated down the generations. On the other hand some investigators recently provide results that isolated populations are unlikely to be very different from more mixed populations in terms of linkage disequilibrium [29]. Tom Meade of the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain, acknowledged that heterogeneous populations will have some advantage because the results will be representative of the population as a whole [25]. The family-based approach in which controls are represented by healthy family members has attracted considerable attention since it minimizes population stratification bias and it avoids making erroneous conclusion. In our Biobank we proposed to collect DNA samples from patients, their relatives and an adequate number of controls of different geographic areas to enable each research unit, independently, to perform case-control and/or family-based association studies in a population belonging to a restricted area. Whenever statistical evidence for a genetic association was obtained, the same data would be checked for the populations collected in other geographic areas. This organization could be highly representative of the IgAN genetic background and more powerful in the detection of weak genetic effects.It is the policy of the IgAN Consortium to favour further collaborative genetic studies. Other investigators not belonging to the IgAN Consortium, who would like to have access to the DNA Bank for genetic studies, must submit the study design to the scientific committee represented by the principal investigators of the IgAN Consortium research units (F.P.S., F.S., A.A., J.F., E.A., K.Z., L.Z.) [see Additional file 1] and must agree to the terms for data publication. Adequate procedures are used to minimize inadvertent release of personal information and to guarantee confidentiality of genetic results, such as disease genetic predisposition or family relationships (non-paternity, adoption). All results published must not reveal the patient's identity.The availability of genetic material from participants in large epidemiological studies represents an invaluable resource for exploring genetic and environment influence on disease risk. In fact, the world's largest study on cancer is the multi-centre European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), which started recruiting in the early 1990's and has now available more than 500,000 individuals [30]. This has allowed the project to move onto the study of genetics since its sample includes 350 cases of colon cancer and nearly 2000 of breast cancer. Our data collection of more than 1000 individuals with IgAN is close to the above mentioned EPIC data for each disease. Robert Hoover, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the National Cancer Institution at Bethesda, Maryland, defines a large epidemiological study as a study which generates 1000 to 1500 individuals with a particular cancer in a reasonable time [26]. Keeping this in mind we collected DNA samples from more than 1000 IgAN patients. However, our Biobank will continue to enrol additional patients in the future for potential stratification of our population with respect to specific phenotypes thus promoting correlations with discovered genotypes.During these last ten years many biobanks have been organized but there is no system for comprehensive registration of the DNA banks. Surely many case-control and family-based association studies will originate from these DNA banks in the future. The IgAN Consortium Biobank has allowed us to carry out a linkage study and various case-control and family-based association studies whose investigation is currently under way. We think that the inclusion of all DNA banks in a public registry might create many advantages for scientists and patients as follows: I) people involved in the scientific and clinical activity of a certain diseases may have a point of reference; II) network of scientists involved in basic and clinical research may obtain many advantages by the public registry; III) patients may contribute by donating their DNA sample to the bank thus increasing the number of collected DNA samples for future studies; IV) the public registry would be available to contribute knowledge which can be generalised regardless results from genetic studies. (Table 3)Table 3 Information in the Data DNA BankFull size table
","IgAN is a complex disorder with both genes and environment contributing in the pathogenesis. A Biobank, depository of a large number of DNA samples from IgAN patients and their relatives, together with a database including their personal and clinical data, has a crucial role in the genetic dissection of IgAN. Such an organization favours and stimulates collaborative studies. The constitution of a well organized and multi-centre biobank, an adequate choice with respect to design strategies and improved genotyping methods could greatly enhance the current understanding of the molecular genetic basis of this disease. Finding complex disease genes may allow us to determine which subjects are at risk of IgAN before that genetic susceptibility is converted into disease. In addition, the identification of such genes should reveal more about the molecular pathway causing the disease, thus suggesting new and relevant targets for more efficient drug treatment."
