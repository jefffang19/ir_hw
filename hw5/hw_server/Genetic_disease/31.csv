0,Clinical and genetic peculiarities of vasculitis associated with Familial Mediterranean fever in Armenian children,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary disorder among Armenians. It manifests mainly in childhood and represents a significant health care pediatric problem. The clinical picture of FMF and vasculitis have much in common: fever, abdominal pain, arthritis, myalgia, skin lesions. Numerous data indicate a higher incidence of vasculitis in FMF patients, compared with healthy ethnically matched populations.",To investigate clinical and genetic peculiarities of vasculitis associated with FMF in children in Armenia.,"A group of 715 children with FMF was observed at the National Pediatric Centre for FMF (438 boys, 277 girls, mean age 8.64±0.17). The diagnosis of FMF was confirmed based on the Tel-Hashomer criteria and molecular genetic detection of MEFV mutations. For statistical analysis standard statistical Epi-Info 2000 Program was performed.","Frequency of vasculitis in Armenian children with FMF was rather high - 4.3% (31 children). Henoch-Shonlein Purpura (HSP) was diagnosed in 1.5% (11) patients, Protracted Febrile Myalgia (PFM) - in 2.7% (20). FMF in these patients characterized by early onset (mean age 3 years), high (4 fold) risk of PFM [RR = 3.90 (1.32 ÷ 11.35); χ2 = 5.94; p = 0.015], as well as late diagnosis of FMF (9.42 ± 0.72) and late onset of colchicine treatment. They had also high frequency of severe FMF attacks, prevalence of acute recurrent arthritis and HSP and PFM manifestation after 5-6 year of FMF onset. The risk of HSP was 5-fold increased in children with severe FMF compared with moderate activity of disease. The development of vasculitis was associated with M694V-homozygous and compound-heterozygous genotypes. Particularly, HSP and PFM were observed respectively at 2.9% and 4.6% M694V-homozygous patients (χ2 = 8.27; p <0.02), which confirms the influence of MEFV genotype on the development of vasculitis."
1,Genetic and phenotypic characteristics of 114 patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency,"Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is a rare autoinflammatory syndrome, characterized by febrile episodes and generalized inflammation.",This study aims to describe the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of MKD in a large international patient cohort.,"Patients were enrolled in the Eurofever registry (EAHC Project No. 2007332), a registry that retrospectively collects information on patients suffering from periodic fever. An expert on MKD validated all patients on clinical and genetic criteria.","One hundred and fourteen patients (53 male, 61 female) with two MVK mutations were included in this study.

Ninety-six patients harboured at least one V377I mutation, fourteen of them had a homozygous V377I mutation. The second most frequent mutation was I268T occurring in 29 patients.Ninety-nine of 114 patients had recurrent inflammatory episodes, while six patients suffered from a chronic course and nine patients had a chronic course with exacerbations. The median disease duration was five days. The median frequency was 12 per year. Triggers inducing febrile episodes were mentioned in 108 patients, the most important ones were vaccination (n=39), infection (n=18) and stress (n=26).One hundred and twelve patients suffered from gastrointestinal complaints, most of them suffering from vomiting (69%), diarrhoea (84%) and abdominal pain (88%). Ninety-nine patients also experienced mucocutaneous symptoms, mainly pharyngitis (28%), stomatitis (60%) and maculopapular rash (39%). Seventy-one percent of all patients had arthralgia and 57 percent had myalgia. Arthritis was less common and occurred in 28%. Neurological complaints occurred in 46 patients, most of them suffering from headache (38%). Cerebellar syndrome (3%), mental retardation (4%) and seizures (5%) were noted in some patients. Many patients had constitutional symptoms, such as malaise (65%), weight loss (66%), fatigue (63%) and mood disorders (24%). AA-amyloidosis was noted in six patients. One patient suffered from macrophage activation syndrome, a life-threatening complication characterized by high fever, pancytopenia and liver damage.Abnormal IgD levels were observed in 55 of 76 tested patients, while 37 of 40 tested patients showed elevated urinary mevalonic acid excretions. Inflammatory parameters, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rates (98%), C-reactive protein (94%) and white blood count (66%), were abnormal in many patients."
2,PReS-FINAL-2155: Genetic variability of methotrexate transporters in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Factors that would predict treatment outcome for methotrexate (MTX) would be of great value to clinicians. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have reported associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in MTX transporters and treatment outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in rheumatoid arthritis.,To investigate the influence of SNP in the genes for MTX uptake and efflux transporters on toxicity and response to therapy in JIA.,"The data of 77 consecutive patients with JIA treated with MTX at the University Children's Hospital Ljubljana from June 2011 to February 2013 have been retrospectively reviewed.

4,"Intervention, integration and translation in obesity research: Genetic, developmental and metaorganismal approaches","Prediction and control of biological systems are driving forces of the life sciences. While varying degrees of these capabilities have been generated in every branch of biology throughout its history, the contemporary post-genomic period has seen a remarkable surge of optimism about the possibility of achieving fine-grained control of complex interactions of biological systems. One of the many physiological systems that appears to call out for systems-based control-oriented inquiry is that of weight gain, loss and maintenance in animal bodies, particularly those of humans. Our foci in this paper are how two aspects of biological practice -- intervention and integration -- orient and configure fields of scientific inquiry and help us understand translational practice better. We suggest that these features are inseparable in ongoing research activity: to intervene successfully in complex systems requires a highly integrated, multi-level understanding that can be transferred to new contexts. Obesity research casts considerable light on this claim and illustrates the difficulties in doing so. It also offers new avenues of investigation for the philosophies of science and medicine.Obesity science tackles the problems and causes of excess weight from a number of directions. The most well known stream of research is concerned with biochemical feedback loops and their genetic bases as well as behavioural contributions. Another rapidly developing body of research focuses on developmental and epigenetic causes of obesity and sees pregnancy and early childhood as major periods of intervention. A third, even newer avenue of research is concerned with the role microbes in the gut play in obesogenesis, and what the interventions are that might alleviate such contributions. What marks all these bodies of research is their dynamic and system-wide conception of obesity, and the integrated conceptual and methodological apparatuses that are brought to bear on the phenomenon of excess fat storage. But of equal relevance is the limited integration amongst these three research programmes, and the obstacles to their translation into effective therapies. In what follows, we outline these different perspectives on obesity, show how they overlap, and what their achievements are regarding the identification of causal relationships and the development of interventions in the process of obesogenesis. We will conclude with a discussion of the relationships between intervention-based and integrative research, and what these relationships mean for more common understandings of basic and applied research, as well as for systems-oriented strategies of inquiry. Our analysis suggests further lines of inquiry that could be pursued fruitfully by philosophers and practitioners of science and medicine, who might be able to work together on areas of common interest.","Fat is the colloquial term for adipocytes or fat cells, which form two different types of adipose tissue: white and brown. Brown fat is a heat-producing tissue that costs the organism calories to maintain [1]. White fat is a fuel storage organ, and it is this fat that is the concern in obesity research. White fat cells are stored as adipose tissue both subcutaneously and around organs, with differential health effects [2]. Obesity is a difficult term to define. It refers to excessive and unhealthy amounts of fat (rather than body weight per se), and is measured by a variety of means, all of which have practical and theoretical problems [3, 4]. But more problematic than the measuring issues are the difficulties of justifying distinctions between 'excessive' amounts of fat, mere overweight, and normal weight. Cultural factors, life history fluctuations, and health status all influence whether a particular person might be considered overweight or obese in a particular situation [5, 6].Despite such complications, obesity was declared a major health problem by the World Health Organization as early as 1985. Although excess fat storage is not a contagious disease in a literal sense, the epidemic metaphor is used to capture the rapidly rising levels of obesity and overweight in many wealthy nations [5, 7]; see [8] for a problematization of this metaphor. Obesity is associated with numerous health consequences, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancers [9]. It may be both a cause and a result of these conditions. Psychological effects, such as depression, have been identified [10], and many social effects of obesity are also well catalogued [11, 12]. There may even be environmental costs to obesity [13]. Recognition of these issues has made obesity into a compelling social, medical and scientific problem. As such, it cries out for effective interventions, and this need orients and drives all obesity-related research.Even though current weight trends are necessarily correlated with 'obesogenic' environments (calorie-rich diet and low-activity lifestyle), these factors are not enough to explain obesity [14, 5]. Weight-gaining predispositions (i.e., the differences between individuals) are considered by geneticists to be highly heritable, with as much as 70%-80% of weight variation attributed to genetic factors [3, 15, 16]. The only trait with higher heritability in humans is height. Most such highly heritable phenotypes, however, show substantial 'missing heritability'. This means that the combined effect of all identified genetic variants associated with the trait or disease can account for only a very small percentage of the difference. In the case of obesity, known genetic factors account for less than five percent of its heritability [17]. In addition, genetic causes cannot explain the massive increase of obesity from one generation to the next, nor its occurrence within a single generation as has happened recently around the world. Accordingly, scientists and public health officials recognize that there must be a complex array of factors at play in weight gain and obesity, ranging from environmental to genetic and developmental contributions, and at every level of biology in between.","Throughout the twentieth century, researchers from various disciplines have conceived of weight maintenance dynamically, as the consequence of a system that connects the brain (the hypothalamus in particular), fat tissue and unknown circulating signalling molecules [18–20]. Homeostasis is the presumed default of such a system, with obesity the result of its malfunction. As obesity research embraced genetic analyses, geneticists armed with biochemical knowledge, and spurred on by epidemiological data about obesity increases, hoped initially that malfunctions in weight homeostasis could be investigated through single-gene defects [21, 22]. Seldom, however, did researchers conceive of obesity as a single phenotype; nor did they think it had a single cause. Already in the early 1990s, geneticists were able to argue that human obesity genotypes will be complex multigenic systems with networks of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. ... The growing number of obesity-related or obesity-causing genes does not bode well for the single gene hypothesis [23, 24].Early approaches to finding the specific genetic variants underpinning obesity relied on candidate-gene approaches that were based on mouse genetics and livestock breeding [25]. Candidate genes are genes that are predicted on the basis of functional knowledge to have an involvement in phenotypic traits of interest. Although there are limitations to such approaches when employed in the service of understanding complex multifactorial traits [26], such studies have nevertheless proved highly fruitful in obesity research. Through this strategy, researchers identified and characterized the first of the five known obesity-associated genes in mice, the agouti gene, in 1992. Agouti protein interrupts melanocortin reception in the brain (where feeding behaviour is regulated), and this results in excessive eating (hyperphagia) and obesity, as well as yellow coat colour [27, 28].Arguably an even more important finding was that of the Lep gene and its product leptin, from the Greek for 'thin', The recessive gene mutation (Lepob -- ob for obesity) had been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes since the early 1950s, as was the mutant db of the leptin receptor gene (Leprdb ) [29]. Studies of mutant ob/ob mice and db/db mice, in which the circulatory system of ob/ob mice were partly joined to lean mice, found that obesity levels in the ob/ob mice decreased. Consequently, the ob/ob mice were thought to lack circulating molecules for leanness [30]. But the db/db mice did not become leaner when their circulatory systems were conjoined with those of non-obese mice, and it was concluded they had a defect in the reception of this circulating molecule [31, 32]. It took the location and cloning of the ob gene to work out what its product was and how it worked in relation to the receptor [33–35, 29].The functional copy of the Lep gene was found to encode the hormone leptin, a signalling molecule that is produced primarily in fat cells. The Lepr gene was identified as coding for the leptin receptor, which is located in the hypothalamic region of the brain as well as in other organs where it binds with leptin [36, 37]. Despite being understood as responsible for a monogenic Mendelian disorder, the ob gene rapidly became known for its complicated involvement in the production of obesity. Early researchers thought that the primary function of Leptin was to make or keep organisms thin, and companies fought to win the licensing rights for leptin-based products [38, 39]. Mutant leptin genes in humans result in morbidly obese individuals who are commonly glucose intolerant and insulin resistant [40]. Such leptin disorders are, however, rare. Leptin is now understood more generally as just one of the key factors in the homeostatic regulation of weight in mice and humans. When food is scarce and fat stores decrease, leptin levels are reduced, priming the organism for starvation conditions [41, 42]. Once food is again available and fat stores replenished, leptin levels rise and inhibit the starvation response. Leptin appears to be informing the brain about the status of fat in the body, thereby connecting feeding behaviour, metabolism and the endocrine system to the organism's nutritional condition [43, 44]. Leptin receptors connect to both feeding stimulus and feeding inhibition neurons in the melanocortin pathway of the hypothalamus. But in obese individuals, high leptin levels -- promoted by fat cells, glucose, insulin and glucocorticoid levels -- do not have the same effect on appetite and fat production due to poorly understood leptin resistance [45]. Because of this resistance, leptin replacement therapies work only on those with congenital leptin deficiences in leptin production or reception, and not on the obese with genetically standard leptin responses. The feedback loop becomes a 'vicious spiral' of ever-increasing weight gain and decreasing leptin sensitivity, especially in the context of a high-fat diet [46].Leptin research can be seen as an exemplar of the development of an integrated molecular physiological approach. The numerous dynamic roles leptin plays in metabolism mean that its initial modelling as an anti-obesity agent has given way to a much more systemic one as an 'integrator of neuroendocrine function' [47]. The early leptin focus broadened rapidly to include a panoply of discoveries of other mechanisms and pathways, such as neuropeptides and receptors involved in short- and long-term feeding responses, as well as gastrointestinal signalling peptides [48, 49]. In these interlinked systems, leptin plays a major but not the only role in appetite control and metabolic function.Increasing knowledge about leptin has also led to the reconceptualization of the role of white fat cells from inert storage devices to highly active endocrine organs [2]. The secretions of these cells (including about 50 other proteins, collectively called 'adipokines', plus other secreted substances) communicate throughout the whole body. They are receptors that interact with a vast range of compounds and are involved in almost every bodily process from reproduction to metabolism and immunological response [50]. Adipokines affect glucose levels, appetite and the function of many organs [51]. In obese individuals, adipose tissue is the largest and most highly variable endocrine organ in the body, and its very distribution pattern (android or gynoid) has major health implications. There is considerable evidence that adipocytes are dysfunctional in obese organisms, and many obesity researchers are convinced that progress will depend on understanding adipose tissue as a developing, regulatory and metabolizing endocrine system [52]. Brown adipose tissue, long thought irrelevant to mature human physiology, is now known from a broader system perspective to have a role in how adipose tissue is maintained in obesity [53]. White adipose tissue is composed of more than adipocytes, and also includes macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts [54]. Some of these cells (possibly adipocytes themselves) produce insulin-desensitizing inflammatory molecules, and a number of researchers now believe that obesity is a low-grade inflammatory disease that causes diabetes [55, 50, 56]. But little so far is known about pathways and mechanisms for adipose tissue-derived inflammation and its relationships to insulin and leptin resistance. Further exploration of this connection seems bound to make the obesity story yet more complex.As part of the attempt to generate a system-wide account of obesity, genome-wide linkage and genome-wide association studies search not for biologically implicated candidate genes, but for particular markers across the genome that are linked to disease [57, 15]. This shift to a bioinformatically driven analysis, often thought of as discovery-driven, has produced numerous associations of genes or genetic regions with obesity, especially in groups with high rates of obesity or in less obesogenic environments [58]. Subsequent efforts to identify mechanisms and biochemical pathways between genes and obesity phenotypes have, however, been slow and halting [59]. The FTO gene is the most robust finding of genome-wide approaches, but it is associated with only a few kilograms of weight gain, and studies of its functional role have only just begun [60, 61].The quest for a full understanding of obesity will not be satisfied by genetic and biochemical explanations, however, even if these are inevitably woven into neurochemical and behavioural explanatory accounts [62]. This is particularly the case because of the limited effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in obese adults and because of the alarming rise in rates of childhood obesity [63]. Some of the genes implicated in obesity phenotypes, such as the FTO gene, may also play a role in epigenetic processes that through effects on satiety regulation can result in increased fat stores [64]. This broader dimension, of epigenetic and developmental analyses of the differential expression of genes, is increasingly important in the investigation of fat production across the lifetimes of individuals and families.","Genetic approaches to obesity have been instrumental to early evolutionary explanations for the rise in obesity level in Western societies. The first such theory was the 'thrifty gene hypothesis', which was formulated in the sixties by geneticist James Neel [65]. According to Neel, thrifty genes were favored by natural selection because they conferred protection against the regular famines our hunter-gatherer ancestors experienced. In contemporary society, however, such genes predispose individuals to obesity and diabetes [65] (see [66] for a critique). John Speakman's 'predation release hypothesis' [67], in contrast, argues that early human adaptations for slimness have been recently displaced by a decrease in selection pressure, which has allowed relevant genes to drift towards obesogenic predispositions. Competing against such gene-based evolutionary accounts were those claiming environmental causes, such as high-fat diet and sedentary lifestyle, are responsible for the immense increase in obesity in affluent societies. This perspective was radically retheorized in the early 1980s by clinical epidemiologist David Barker. He detected a positive correlation between poor conditions in childhood, which he measured with infant mortality rates and birth weight, and later metabolic diseases [68]. His studies showed that early prenatal exposure to adverse environmental effects had immediate effects on birth weight, which created predispositions to late-onset lifestyle diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease [69, 70]. From these findings Barker formulated his 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis', according to which the fetus reacts to circumstances in its environment through vascular, metabolic and endocrine adaptations [71].A flood of epidemiological and laboratory-based animal studies has strongly supported Barker's original claims. Some of this experimentation has shown that different disease phenotypes can be produced by differential gene expression [72–75]. This perspective has been labelled more broadly 'the developmental origins of health and disease' (DOHaD) paradigm [76]. Paediatrician and endocrinologist Peter Gluckman and colleagues have argued that the thrifty phenotype hypothesis and DOHaD should be understood as a subset of the more encompassing processes of 'developmental plasticity' that allow organisms to adapt to a suite of different environments with the most suitable phenotypic variant. The placenta is thought to play the key role in what is often referred to as 'fetal programming', which involves both structural changes to major organs and the epigenetic modification of key genetic factors [77]. Some researchers reject the biologically problematic metaphor of 'programming' because of its connotations of genetic preformation [78], but in this field it has been adopted to communicate that the fetus treats the nutrient supply through the placenta as a forecast for the availability of food after birth, and prepares for this with a modified developmental trajectory [72]. The organism adapts itself teleologically (with the goal of survival) to its environment, and this adaptability -- produced by phenotypic plasticity -- is an evolved capacity of such organisms.Gluckman has explained the long-term effects of the maternal environment on offspring not simply as responses to developmental disruption, nor merely as short-term adaptive responses. He understands them rather as 'predictive adaptive responses' (PARs). Early environmental cues shift the developmental pathways in order to match the phenotype to the projected environment [75]. These PARs manifest their adaptive effects later in life rather than immediately. The advantage of such a plastic strategy depends crucially on the accuracy of the forecast of the postnatal environment. A thrifty phenotype with a high ratio of fat to muscle cells, a highly efficient metabolism, weight-gaining appetite and exercise regulation may have clear advantages in an environment with poor nutritional supply. In an environment with an overabundance of high-fat food, however, such a phenotype is likely to lead to high weight gain and an increased risk of associated diseases. Gluckman and colleagues name this scenario the 'environmental mismatch hypothesis'. They thus embed their developmental explanation within a broader evolutionary analysis [79].While epidemiological studies have been very important for detecting strong associations between certain phenotypes and distinct developmental factors, they are only guides to the causal bases and potential points of intervention in syndromes such as obesity. Only in the last few years have molecular bridges been made between periconceptual (prior to conception), prenatal and perinatal (around the time of birth) environments, long-term changes in gene expression of normal housekeeping genes, and permanent changes in adult morphology, physiology and behavior [71]. The observed plasticity in human and non-human developmental trajectories is believed to be achieved largely through the altered expression of key regulatory genes that regulate cell number and differentiation early in development, thus permanently resetting many homeostatic mechanisms [71]. These epigenetic factors can play a major role in weight gain in later life.The term 'epigenetics' was originally coined by Conrad Waddington as the synthesis of 'genetics' and 'epigenesis' in reference to the interaction between genetic, cytoplasmic and environmental factors as they construct the phenotype [80]. In today's molecular biology, epigenetic modifications refer to heritable changes in phenotype that are not caused by changes in the underlying gene sequence but arise in dependence on the molecular modification of the DNA or posttranslational modifications of the proteins that package the DNA. These mechanisms programme the time- and tissue-dependent expression of genes and the differentiation of cells from their totipotent state as stem cells to their final phenotype as differentiated somatic cells of various tissue types. Experimental evidence in epigenetics has associated specific disease risks with environmental exposure during narrow time-frames. An increased risk for obesity has been clearly linked to maternal malnutrition in the first trimester [81, 74]. In cloned animals, nutritionally challenged maternal environments as early as the periconceptual and pre-implantation period can lead to long-term effects on metabolic function [82, 83]. In humans, in vitro fertilization confers a higher risk of obesity later in life, possibly due to low methylation (hypomethylation) in culture conditions of typically methylated and therefore silenced maternal alleles such as the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-2) [84].The most well known evidence for epigenetic changes in humans induced by maternal malnutrition comes from the natural experiment created by the famine of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945. A study of subjects exposed to famine conditions, particularly during periconceptional and early fetal periods, revealed an association with the hypomethylation of the IGF-2 differentially methylated region six decades later [80]. Because the hypomethylated gene is expressed, these subjects and their children showed a significantly increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. However, this hypomethylation was not associated with lower birth weight, which is instead associated with exposure to famine in a later prenatal period. This study reinforces the supposition that very early development is a crucial period for establishing and maintaining epigenetic marks [81].But these accounts are dependent on maternal malnutrition, which is not the case for most mothers in Western societies, with the notable exceptions of less affluent social groups or women following extremely restricted diets. Experimental evidence points to several developmentally plastic processes that increase the risk of developing obesity in an environment with easy access to high-energy food. One pathway leads from prenatal malnutrition and -- importantly -- high glucocorticoid exposure due to stress, to an increased sensitivity to an obesogenic environment. Such malnutrition of the fetus can also be induced by a restricted placental supply associated with early, late and first pregnancies. A second pathway predicts a higher risk for obesity later in life following maternal high-fat and low protein diet, obesity and diabetes. These antenatal challenges can be postnatally amplified through infant overfeeding, which includes the so-called catch-up growth often experienced by low-birth weight children [71]. The most impressive experimental evidence for prenatal changes in epigenetic gene expression as a response to maternal cues involves the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related to the stress response. The GR binds glucocorticoid, a hormone involved in the stress response pathway, which has multiple behavioral and metabolic functions, including inflammation and insulin interference. Hypermethylation and underexpression of GR in the rat brain and liver results from an excessive exposure to maternal glucocorticoids in the womb, as well as from prenatal protein restriction and changes in maternal care behavior immediately after birth [85, 86].Another early candidate gene for the modification of epigenetic expression due to maternal nutrition, and in preparation for a nutritionally challenged environment, is the IGF2 gene [87]. Under normal conditions it is maternally imprinted and hence only expressed from the paternally inherited allele. A great range of other genes have been implicated in epigenetic alteration after exposure to either malnutrition, maternal stress, or an oversupply of glucose and fat. Many of the long-term effects experienced by the first-generation offspring have been inherited by the second, and occasionally even third-generation offspring [88]. This is not surprising considering that in females the primary oocytes (egg cells) develop well before birth, thereby gaining exposure to maternal cues for the next generation. In general, epigenetic mechanisms can cause environmental cues experienced by the parent to shift the offspring's developmental pathways, which then modify the phenotype in 'expectation' of a later environment. This process is sometimes described as 'spite the mother -- fight the offspring' [89].The potential for finding epigenetic causes of obesity and other metabolic diseases promises increased chances of medical and public-health intervention. The PAR paradigm has shown that the more molecular insight is gained into the influence of environmental cues on the phenotype, the more sophisticated an understanding of gene-environment interactions is needed. Environments matter in several ways: as immediate versus long-term effects on gene expression, and as past gene-environment interactions that strongly influence present gene-environment interactions. Consequently, the complex interaction of their combined influences on a phenotype is what dictates the path for intervention. Two interdependent approaches to reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases later in life can be extracted from the PAR paradigm. First, promoting the health and nutrition of female reproducers may prevent chronic disease in future generations [75]. Second, intervention can attempt to manage the postnatal infant in accordance with its prenatal programming. There may also be opportunities for drug-based intervention. It has been shown in animals that leptin administration in the sensitive period after birth can partly reverse the course of development towards obesity [73, 90]. What connects these two approaches to intervention is the biology of epigenetics.Intervention is enabled by extensive knowledge of the enzymes involved in the establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic marks both of the DNA and its histone proteins, and of the mechanisms that link environmental cues such as behavior or diet to epigenetic mechanisms [91, 84]. Generally, exogenic influences such as behavioral or nutritional exposure trigger specific signaling pathways, which in turn activate sequence specific elements such as transcription factors, enhancers, or miRNAs. Knowledge of these pathways and their adaptive origins may open up possibilities for both the prevention of gene expression pathways in the fetus and the correction of already programmed, developmental responses to early cues. These sorts of interventions would decrease susceptibility to obesity after birth [92, 93]. None of this will be simply achieved, but it can be supported by a broad public-health orientation to intervention that is generally focused on maternal well-being."
5,"Association of miR-27a, miR-181a and miR-570 genetic variants with gallbladder cancer susceptibility on North indian population","MicroRNAs are small endogenously expressed short non-coding RNAs. They appear to be critical regulators of tumor biology as their aberrant expression is well characterized in cancer progression. The role of microRNA is not fully understood in gallbladder carcinoma, so in present study we investigated the role of miR-27a, miR-181a and miR-570 genetic variants with gallbladder cancer (GBC) susceptibility.","In this case-control study, we evaluated the role of miR-27a, miR-181a and miR-570 genetic polymorphisms with GBC susceptibility in North Indian population. The present study included 515 GBC patients and 200 healthy controls from North India. Genotypes were determined by TaqMan probes. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS ver. 16. In silico analysis was performed using Bioinformatics tools (F-SNP, FAST-SNP).","Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of miR-27a, miR-181a and miR-570 genetic polymorphism with GBC susceptibility (P> 0.05). On stratifying our data on the basis of gall stone status, the [AG+GG] genotypes of miRNA rs895819 (A>G) were significantly associated with increased risk of GBC in patients without stone (p=0.003 OR=1.83 [(95%CI) 1.23-2.72]. The genetic risk by miR-27a, rs895819 (A>G) was also modulated by tobacco consumption as the heterozygotes (AG) were at higher risk p=0.005 OR=1.94 [(95%CI) 1.22-3.08]. However, there was no association of miR-181a and miR-570 polymorphisms with disease risk in subgroup analysis. In-silico analysis showed change in transcriptional regulation of miR-27a and miR-570 variations.",We found significant association of miRNA rs895819 A>G with gallbladder cancer risk through gallstone independent pathway and tobacco usage.
6,Evaluation of galectin-3 genetic variants and lipid profile in RA patients in North Indian population,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of peripheral joints which leading to deformity and disability. Galectin- 3 is emerging as one of key molecules in pathogenesis of RA. The aim of the present study was to evaluate association of two genetic variants rs4644 and rs4652 of galectin-3 with susceptibility towards RA in North Indian population. The study further involved evaluation of lipid profile variables in cases and controls.","The present case-control study involved 200 RA patients diagnosed according to 1987 revised criteria of American college of Rheumatology and 200 unrelated age, sex and ethnicity matched controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyping was done with PCR-RFLP. Sample size for genetic association was calculated by CaTS Power calculator (http://www.sph.umich.edu). Serum was analyzed for lipid profile biomarkers using standard reagents and kits. Genotypic distribution of control and RA was compared by odds ratio statistics using medcal software. Differences in lipid profile were analyzed by independent `t’ test using SPSS version 18.0 (IL, USA, and Chicago)","The genotypic distribution of +191(A/C) showed significant differences between patients and controls (odds ratio = 1.9552, 95% CI = 1.0461-3.6542, p<0.05). AA genotype was found to be more prevalent in patients in comparison to controls. However, genotypic distribution for +292 (C/A) showed no significant difference between controls and cases (odds ratio = 0.2768, 95% CI = 0.0541-1.4149, p>0.05 ). RA patients were found to be dyslipidemic as indicated by the significantly higher atherogenic index as compared to controls (p<0.01).",Galectin-3 may play an important role in pathogenesis of RA.
7,The genetics of infectious disease susceptibility: has the evidence for epistasis been overestimated?,"Differences amongst individuals in their susceptibility to infection seldom have a simple genetic basis and are often determined by a complex interplay of multiple loci. Characterizing the number, location and effect size of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying this variation informs our understanding of not only the pathways that influence susceptibility, but also the potential coevolutionary dynamics of host and parasites. Of particular interest is the role that epistasis, defined broadly as interactions among loci in determining a phenotype, has in shaping the variation we see in infectious disease susceptibility. For most complex traits, quantitative genetic theory suggests that epistasis is unlikely to contribute substantially to genetic variation [1, 2]. However, models of host-parasite co-evolution typically feature some degree of epistasis between resistance loci [3, 4], and the results of empirical linkage and association mapping studies suggest that epistatic interactions can explain considerable variation in infectious disease characteristics within natural populations [5, 6].In this article, we will discuss the current state of genetic studies of disease susceptibility, with a particular focus on the theoretical and empirical support for epistasis. We then ask if the genetic basis of infectious disease susceptibility is different from other traits, or if the evidence for epistatic interactions has been overestimated. To provide the necessary background, we first give a brief overview of the debate surrounding the contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of complex traits.","A quantitative genetic understanding of complex traits is based on partitioning the variation between individuals that is due to their genotypes into additive, dominance and epistatic components [7]. Each component relates to a different form of gene action, with the additive component describing the variance associated with the independent contribution of alleles, dominance describing the variance contributed by interactions between alleles at the same locus, and epistasis referring to the contribution of interactions between alleles at different loci (Figure 1). While the relative contribution of each of these components to genetic variance depends on the underlying allele frequencies within a population, quantitative genetic theory suggests that most of the genetic variation in a population will be due to the additive effect of allelic substitutions [1]. Yet this assertion is not without controversy. Although the additive genetic basis of a trait can be readily estimated using information on the relatedness of individuals (via known breeding designs or pedigrees), only a fraction of this genetic variation has been linked to underlying loci in genome-wide association studies (GWAS; [8], but see [9]). This ‘missing heritability’, as it has been termed [10], together with the increasing knowledge of modifier genes and gene networks, has led to the suggestion that epistasis may make a substantial contribution to the overall levels of genetic variation [5] and that the contribution of additive variance may have even been overestimated [11].Figure 1Models of gene action for complex traits. Phenotypic values are shown for two diploid host loci under different patterns of gene action. (a) Additive effects at locus A and B. Each allele contributes a fixed metric value to the trait, independent of the effects of other alleles at the same or different loci. Human height is a classic example of a complex trait where approximately 80% of the variation in height amongst individuals is due to additive genetic effects [8]. (b) Dominance at locus A. Both loci are independent, but with dominance occurring at locus A, as the phenotypic value of the heterozygote is not midway between the values of the two homozygotes. Complete dominance, as shown here, is typical of Mendelian genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease where an affected individual need only inherit one copy of the mutant allele. (c) Epistatic interactions between locus A and B. Epistasis is estimated as the deviance from the additive combination of two loci and can take many forms, depending on whether an allele combination is more or less fit than expected. Well known examples of epistasis include the interaction between genes in shaping coat color in mice, or the occurrence of synthetic lethality seen when mutations occur in two genes with redundant functions [13].Full size imageAt the heart of this debate is the assumption that the importance of epistasis at the mechanistic level is reflected in the patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation at the level of the population. Within an individual, interactions between genes can result from a wide range of molecular mechanisms and can have positive or negative effects on fitness, depending on whether the resulting phenotype is greater or less than the individual effects of the alleles [12, 13]. This functional impact of gene-gene interactions, however, is different from the statistical contribution of epistasis to complex trait variation within a population [13], because the latter depends on the distribution of allele frequencies in that population [7]. If most alleles are at extreme frequencies, then the majority of genetic variation should still be additive, even if there is dominance or epistasis acting at individual loci [1]. In this case, the effect of rare alleles that interact will be negligible as the likelihood that two rare alleles are present in the same individual is very low. Thus, from a quantitative genetic perspective, it seems unlikely that epistatic interactions will contribute substantially to phenotypic variance unless the alleles are of major effect, and the frequencies of alleles involved in epistatic interactions are intermediate.","How then does the genetic architecture of disease resistance compare to other complex traits? Based on models of host-pathogen coevolution, resistance is commonly predicted to involve multiple host genes and strong interactions between alleles at different host loci (Figure 2). Epistasis in the matching-allele class of models, for example, arises because each multi-locus parasite genotype can only infect a corresponding multi-locus host genotype [14, 15]. As natural selection favors parasites that match the most common host genotype, overrepresented host genotypes become disproportionately unfit, while rarer allele combinations now have a fitness advantage. This type of selection, whereby the fitness of a genotype decreases as its frequency increases, is known as negative frequency-dependent selection. Conversely, in the gene-for-gene model of host-pathogen interactions [16], epistasis can be incorporated via the costs associated with maintaining multiple resistance alleles (for example, [17]). Here, the costs of resistance either accelerate or decelerate with the number of contributing loci [18], aiding the maintenance of polymorphisms in resistance genes. In both cases, epistasis facilitates the rapid co-evolutionary cycles that are a hallmark of host-pathogen theory [19, 20], as recombination can now break-up unfavorable allele combinations, allowing oscillations between host and parasite genotypes under negative frequency-dependent selection.Figure 2Genetic models of host-parasite interactions. Infection outcomes are shown for three different interaction models (haploid hosts and parasites with two loci and two alleles each), where R represents resistant individuals, I represents non-resistant individuals, and P represents partially resistant individuals. (a) Gene-for-gene-model. The mechanistic basis of the gene-for-gene model is that resistance by the host requires recognition of a gene product ‘elicitor’ produced by the parasite [15, 16]. Thus, a host is resistant if it contains one resistance allele that matches an avirulence allele (A or B) of the parasite. (b) Matching-allele model. In an architecture inspired by the self-nonself recognition systems of the animal immune system [14, 15], the matching-allele model assumes that a host can resist a parasite unless the parasite matches all of its interacting alleles. (c) Multiplicative matching-alleles model. This model is presented as a counterpoint to the matching-allele model, as it does not implicitly involve epistatic interactions between resistance alleles at different loci [4, 29]. Instead, the number of matched alleles determines host and parasite fitness in a multiplicative fashion, leading to intermediate, or partial, estimates of resistance.Full size imageIn support of such genetic models, studies of infectious disease susceptibility have commonly documented three key indicators of epistasis. Both linkage and association mapping studies have shown that variation in measures of resistance are often associated with multiple QTL of major effect, that interactions between loci contribute substantially to phenotypic variation, and that evidence for specific candidate loci is often difficult to replicate in other experiments or environments [6, 21]. In a meta-analysis of over 500 QTL mapping experiments, for example, Wilfert and Schmid-Hempel [6] found that epistatic interactions were identified in 48 of 62 studies involving genome-wide scans, with most epistatic loci not previously identified using single QTL analyses (123 of 170 loci). Conventional quantitative genetic studies have also characterized the contribution of non-additive genetic components to patterns of susceptibility and resistance. Using reciprocal crosses between four populations, for example, a study of resistance in the red flour beetle (Triboliumcastanaeum) found that epistasis explained significant variation in host survival only upon infection by a parasite, and not under the unexposed and uninfected control conditions [22].","At first glance, the high prevalence of epistasis in mapping studies of disease traits suggests that interactions amongst host resistance genes might indeed contribute substantially to variation in disease susceptibility, as is assumed by models of host-parasite coevolution. What needs to be taken into account, however, is the estimation bias inherent in conventional mapping studies. Minor effect variants, for example, are unlikely to be identified in linkage studies due to a combination of broadly spaced markers and limited sample sizes. Conversely in association mapping, rare alleles will be difficult to detect due to the reliance on linkage disequilibrium between common markers and common causative variants (see discussions in [23]). Gene frequencies are also altered as part of the design of traditional mapping panels, which typically involve some level of inbreeding, combined with crosses between a few individuals representing phenotypic or even population extremes. In an F2 inter-cross between high and low resistance genotypes, for example, allele frequencies are on average 0.5, even if variants within the mapping panel were at extreme frequencies in the original population. Thus, by concentrating or combining alleles of major effect within and between populations, conventional mapping studies bias allele frequencies towards intermediate values and therefore increase the chance of finding epistasis.Without information on the effect size and frequency of alleles in natural populations, it is difficult to determine whether epistatic interactions contribute substantially to genetic variation in quantitative susceptibility, or if the contribution of such interactions to individual variation has been overestimated. The lack of success in identifying the same loci across different experiments, for example, could be due to epistasis between resistance loci, or the result of the strong sampling bias and small fraction of genetic variation that is captured using experimental crosses. Nonetheless, identified epistatic interactions can be functionally important. In a number of studies, gene-gene interactions have helped characterize the pathways underlying the mechanisms of resistance (for example, [24–27]). In the mouse, for example, epistatic interactions revealed a new mechanism for resistance to the mouse cytomegalovirus, which involves an interaction between a receptor for natural killer cells and a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex on virus-infected cells [28]. Such studies highlight the functional utility of characterizing epistasis, even if the statistical contribution of each gene-gene interaction to variation in a complex trait remains unclear."
